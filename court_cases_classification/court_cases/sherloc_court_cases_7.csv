"Mr. Solomon Sauls ran an illegal enterprise with the purpose of poaching and selling abalone (Haliotis midae) in South Africa. A group of abalone divers worked under him supplying him with illegally harvested abalone. The accused bribed officials from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to prevent them from confiscating abalone and to buy back abalone already seized by the authorities. The corrupt officials are facing charges in a separate trial.In March 2018, the police searched the accused’s house and encountered cash that the accused confessed to proceeds of his illegal activities. In February 2021, the defendant pleaded guilty to 41 counts involving running an illegal enterprise, corruption, money laundering and possessing and transporting illegally harvested abalone.Factors aggravating the sentence were the seriousness of corrupting government officials, the engagement in the illegal abalone trade on a commercial scale and financial greed.The accused has been involved in similar crimes in the past and previously received prison sentences for his involvement with another illegal enterprise focusing on abalone poaching.In 2019, he was found responsible for running an illegal abalone business in a different area and was handed a 14-year sentence.In the current trial, Solomon Sauls was sentenced to 244 years imprisonment, running concurrently and resulting in an effective 18-year sentence. Of those 18 years, 12 were determined to run concurrently to the previous sentence of 14 years.",money laundry,1
"SummaryHarmony Gold Mine (Pty) Limited is a mining company operating the Masimong Gold Mine in the district of Henneman in South Africa. Miners can legally enter the shafts if they are able to produce a mining identity card used to clock-in and out when entering and exiting the mine. Notwithstanding, it was common knowledge that the clocking system could be breached allowing illegal miners to enter the mine. Illegal mining operations inside the mine were a known phenomenon and illegal processing or refinery plants were found and subsequently destroyed in the past.From 10-11 April 2014, an underground “clean-up” operation to expose illegal miners was carried out by a security agency. During the operation, makeshift gold processing plants, beds, letters, books, name lists and other documents were discovered, together with large quantities of extracted ore. The documents included gold transaction notes and photographs, pointing towards the identities of the illegal miners.The investigation brought to light that ore worth ZAR 125 million were extracted using processing plants. Yet, on site, investigators only discovered material worth ZAR 41 million (1211 tons of ore) that were moved and made ready for further transports using canvas bags.Though no one was arrested during the two-day operations, 22 people were found and arrested between 16 April and 14 July 2014, mostly while being on the mine’s premises. One person was arrested outside the premises, incriminated by document evidence encountered on site.The group of arrested consisted of nationals from Mozambique and Zimbabwe between 20 and 43 years old and were found to have a varying degree of involvement in the illegal enterprise. Lovemore Chaba Mlambo was identified as orchestrating the illegal operations.They were found guilty of racketeering, money laundering, as well as contravention of the Precious Metals Act and the Criminal Procedure Act. On 14 March 2017, the Virginia Circuit Court sentenced them to prison sentences ranging from 3 to 20 years.They appealed the judgment in front of the High Court of South Africa, Free State Division (Bloemfontein) but saw their appeal rejected on 22 March 2019.Details on the appealThe appellants argued that they had not been caught conducting any illegal mining operations. The respondent countered that the essential ingredient for the criminal racketeering activity is the conspiracy to commit an organized criminal offence or to participate in an unlawful enterprise. Hence, the appellants could be prosecuted on racketeering charges even though they were not caught red-handed. The court found that an implicit agreement among the appellants was manifested in the construction of the illegal refinery plants and the fact that ore had been extracted already, which in itself is a laborious effort requiring collaboration. Furthermore, the names of some illegal miners were found in documentation seized on site. Following a similar line of argumentation, the court rejected the challenge of an established common purpose and enterprise-like organization of the appellants.Moreover, the appellants argued that while ore valued up to ZAR 125 million were extracted, only ZAR 41 million (1211 tons) worth of ore were found on site, implying that the lion share of gold could still be somewhere in the mine. Therefore, the mine operator would not have lost that ore. The court denied this argument of appeal based on the fact that the ore encountered had already been extracted and prepared for future transport which, in turn, showed that the group was capable of removing extracted ore from the mining premises. Furthermore, the court argued that the extracted but not encountered ore would amount to a quantity of 2481 tons, making it significant enough to not be overlooked and hence, unlikely to still reside within the premises of the mine. Paperwork seized on the illegal mining site further documented that extracted ore had previously been sold to an outside buyer.Also, the appellants argued that the identity of the perpetrators was not reasonably established beyond doubt.  This is because none of the appellants was found either near the shaft nor mining nor being in possession of gold ore. The respondent argued that the appellants were arrested by staff of the mine security at the surface as they stepped out of the elevator leading down to the mine. None of them was able to identify themselves with a valid mine identity card, yet many of them were in possession of mining equipment such as safety heads, protectors and cap lamps. Hence, the court found it unlikely that any of the arrested coming out of the shaft had any other business in mind than participating in the ongoing illegal mining operation.Consequently, the appeal was rejected.",money laundry,1
"SummaryThe three defendants were found guilty on multiple counts relating to running an illegal enterprise which illegally harvested and exported abalones. In March 2019, they were sentenced to 15-18 years imprisonment.Illegal harvesting and trading of abalone have been a reason for concern in South Africa’s Eastern Cape since the 1990s. The seaside city Port Elizabeth is considered a hub for the illegal trade in abalone and has been declared to be a hotspot of criminal enterprises and kingpins. The numbers of abalone, which is mostly sold as delicacy to Asia, has been in decline, sparking the government to respond to the issue by establishing dedicated teams seeding abalone and patrolling the area.Details On 22 March 2015, a member of the South African Police Service observed suspicious activities while being on patrol along the coast heading towards Noordhoek. He observed individuals coming out of the water loading backs onto vehicles. He chased the vehicles and was able to arrest one suspect after a hot pursuit, encountering abalone on the suspect’s car. Another suspect working for the defendants was found in possession of abalone without a permit a month later. The South African Police Service launched an investigation into the operation of the defendants.The lead investigator described the illegal operations of the defendants as syndicate-like. While their enterprise relied on the support of several people, the defendants conducted their operations on a need-to-know basis, in which different participants in the supply chain would have limited knowledge about the overall operation. Abalones are being harvested by divers using diving equipment provided for by the accused. The harvested abalones would be packed and marked with an identification mark of the respective harvester. From there, the abalones would be loaded onto motor vehicles, from where a driver would take them to the “weight house”. In that station, the abalones would be sorted by size, had their shell removed and weighted. Based on their weight, the divers would be paid. Another driver would then take the abalones to another location where they would be stored in freezers. Yet another person would later pick them up to transport them to the processing plant, where the abalones get cleaned and cooked. Via the cities of Gauteng or Cape Town, the abalones would ultimately be shipped to China and sold as delicacy.",money laundry,1
"Johannes Erasmus van Staden was a Cape Town businessman and registered representative vendor of Indo Atlantic Seafoods (Pty) Limited, Indo Atlantic Shipping limited and Southern Ocean Marine Corporation (Pty) Limited. From 2005 to 2008, he engaged in an illegal scheme through which he defrauded the South African Revenue Service (SARS). His modus operandi included falsely presenting invoices and inflated fish export records to the SARS, which in return refunded VAT to Mr. van Staden’s company. Over the course of time, Mr. van Staden defrauded taxes of more than R250 million. In June 2016, he was found guilt on 43 charges of racketeering, fraud, reckless conduct of business, and contravention of the Prevention of Organized Crime Act, such as money laundering. Mr. Staden was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and had R6 million worth of assets confiscated.During 2005 and 2008, Mr. van Staden submitted false records about alleged fish exports to the SARS, indicating much higher amounts of fish exports than accurate. Furthermore, he submitted alleged expenditures of his business, such as expenditures for refrigerator systems, delivery trucks, and fish production lines. He obtained authentic invoices for these expenditures by requesting quotes from different providers in the fisheries industry. He repeatedly accepted offers and asked for invoices, which he claimed were for financial purposes. Upon reception of these invoices, he submitted them to the SARS but walked away from the deals. Through this, Mr. van Staden not only defrauded money from the SARS but also inflicted significant economic damage on third-party service providers.In early 2005, Mr. van Staden approached S&D Consulting to function as bookkeeper and accountant to the Indo Atlantic group on a commission basis. Later that year, the First National Bank closed the account of Indo Atlantic Seafoods (Pty) Limited, upon which S&D Consulting started to receive their financial transactions instead. After deducting their commission and fee, SD Consulting forwarded the money to Indo Atlantic companies. Mr. van Staden lived a lavish lifestyle with that money, funnelling it through a family trust called Swordfish Trust. Through this, he financed his luxury expenses, including the purchase of a game farm, an airplane, different motor vehicles, an apartment for his daughter, and a family vacation with chartered jet.The initial indictment was directed at Mr. van Staden and five other potential perpetrators. In June 2016, Mr. van Staden was found guilty on 43 out of 184 counts, whereas the other accused were found not guilty on all charges. Mr. Staden was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and had R6 million worth of assets confiscated.",money laundry,1
"Juan Hattingh was a young practicing attorney and conveyancer with a portfolio of high profile clients that included four important South African banks, namely, ABSA, Standard Bank, First National Bank, and Nedbank. Apart from his firm, Hattingh Attorneys, of which he was the sole proprietor, he also held interests in other local firms of attorneys. As his practice flourished, he ventured into other enterprises such as property development and construction. In 2011, he pleaded guilty to a sophisticated scheme of fraud, theft, and money laundering in which he utilized his professional attorney’s trust account for criminal purposes. The scheme included the registration of properties acquired by Hattingh under the names of friends and relatives, double-bonded properties, and the use of his trust account as a deposit for the stolen funds. “In other words, he had operated his trust account as a vehicle through which to launder the proceeds of his unlawful activities.” (Hamman & Koen, 2012). Hattingh was convicted of 64 counts of fraud, one count of theft and one count of money laundering. He received an effective term of 20 years' imprisonment for the charges of fraud and theft, and a suspended sentence of 8 years' imprisonment for the charge of money laundering. Additionally, the Law Society successfully applied to have his name struck off the roll of practicing attorneys.On appeal against the sentences imposed on him in respect of the fraud charges, he contended that the trial court had sentenced him beyond the scope of his guilty plea and had overlooked mitigating factors. The Supreme Court of Appeal agreed with him and reduced his sentence to 12 years' imprisonment for the charge of fraud.",money laundry,1
"In November 2010, under the authority of the South African National Director of Public Prosecution, Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited entered into an agreement whereby it pleaded guilty to 102 counts related to charges stemming from having allowed its ‘employees and facilities to be used to conduct … illegal kidney transplant operations’. In addition to Netcare, a number of other charges were laid against the St Augustine's Hospital, located in Durban, South Africa, the CEO of Netcare, Richard Friedland, and eight others: four transplant doctors, a nephrologist, two transplant administrative coordinators, and an interpreter. The admission of guilt related to 109 illegal kidney transplant operations that took place between June 2001 and November 2003. The scheme involved Israeli citizens in need of kidney transplants who would be brought to South Africa for transplants performed at St Augustine's Hospital.While the kidneys supplied originally came from Israeli citizens, ‘later Romanian and Brazilian citizens were recruited as their kidneys were obtainable at a much lower cost’. The broker, Ilan Perry, was the individual who was in charge of the recruitment of both kidney suppliers and recipients and was not South African and has not been charged. He set a fee of between USD 100,000 and USD 120,000 for recipients and paid the original suppliers of kidneys USD 20,000. However, later on in the scheme, Romanians and Brazilians received on average of USD 6,000.Ilan Perry used recruiters to source individuals ready to supply kidneys; two of these, Captain Ivan Da Silva and Gaby Tauber, had been imprisoned in Brazil for their roles in the affair. Blood screening of prospective kidney suppliers was done in-country and again in South Africa in an attempt to ‘ensure sufficient compatibility with prospective recipients’; those deemed suitable were ‘accommodated and chaperoned’ and ‘given documents to sign falsely indicating that they were related to each other’. This fraudulent activity was meant to circumvent the requirement to gain outside approval, via a Ministerial Committee, for transplants of unrelated principals. While Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited was paid up-front for its participation in the illegal kidney transplants, the people supplying the healthy kidneys were paid after the fact and in cash.The charges to which Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited pleaded guilty were laid under the South African Human Tissue Act 1983 and the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 1998. It might be mentioned that the company escaped charges which had been leveled at the other accused, including fraud, forgery, and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm (for operations without informed consent). The Human Tissue Act 1983 prohibited the transplantation of the tissue of minors into another living person; requiring that written consent be provided; and that no purchase of tissue, such as kidneys, was allowed. Further, there existed a Ministerial Policy of the Department of Health which set out, inter alia, that:“Donor organs must be used primarily for South African citizens and permanent residents. Written consent must be obtained from the Minister of Health before any person who is not a South African citizen or permanent resident is accepted onto a transplantation programme.”The Ministerial policy also established that a Ministerial Committee had to approve applications for transplantation of unrelated living donors so as ‘to reduce the possibility of abuse’.The prosecutor later argued that the company and the other accused must have been aware of the law and policy regarding transplants from living donors, and that they had to try to find a way to portray ostensible compliance with the current policy and legislation. They therefore created the pretence that the kidney suppliers were related to the recipients.The first charge--counts 1 to 5--to which Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited pleaded guilty related to the use of five minors as organ suppliers in violation of the Human Tissue Act 1983. The employees of St Augustine's Hospital were recognised, in the convoluted Charge Sheet of the Prosecutor, to be ‘acting on behalf of the accused company and were about the exercised of their powers and the performance of their duties as employees of the company furthering or endeavouring to further the interests of the company’, in carrying out these illegal kidney transplants. Counts 6 to 10 constituted the second charge and related to receiving payment for the kidney transplants emanating from the five minors. It might be mentioned that Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited received payments from the broker and it then disbursed payment ‘to the other accused and service providers; including the surgeons for their services’. The third charge, consisting of counts 11 through 102, related to contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 1998. In regard to the 102 transplant operations that did not include minors, the company pleaded guilty to its employees having received money, the proceeds of an unlawful activity; while Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited admitted that ‘in the circumstances’, it knew ‘that the aforementioned property formed part of the proceeds of unlawful activities’.In the Agreement between Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited and the State, the State recognised its own legitimate interest ‘in overseeing the control over transplant of human tissues […] the interests of the medical profession and the public at large’. Where the public interest was concerned, the Agreement noted:“that a company, such as the accused company, guilty of an offence such as this, should be convicted and punished and more particularly, that that conviction and punishment should take place in open court for society as a whole to come to know and understand that the prosecuting authorities and the Department of Health will not tolerate breaches of the code of conduct and standards of ethics and compliance with the law required in a civilised society.”The Agreement then set out the penalty imposed: a confiscation order of ZAR 3,800,000 (approximately USD 466,839) amounting to the benefit the company derived from the offences, plus a sentence of ZAR 4,020,000 (approximately USD 493,875) amounting to fines for each of the counts to which Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited pleaded guilty.",other crimes,0
"The organized criminal group is highly organised and operates transnationally. They are commonly known in South Africa as the “Mountain Boys”.The syndicate engaged in a range of criminal activities that constitute serious offences under South African law. The offences relate to racketeering activities and related categories of offences including money-laundering offences. The information gathered further indicates that in addition thereto these entities and persons have through their criminal activities committed a range of further serious offences including theft, fraud as well as offences under the provisions of the South African Mining Rights Act as well as the Precious Metals Act. There are five clearly distinguishable levels of activities used by the syndicate to smuggle unwrought precious metals (PGMs). This is illustrated as follows:As a starting point, PGMs are stolen at source from the mines, often in large quantities. These PGMs are eventually sold through various receivers to exporters.The various levels of the criminal operators in the illicit PGM industry can be explained as follows:Level 1 “the runners”The unwrought PGM’s are stolen from the processing plants in South African Mines and is commonly referred to as “theft at the source”. A runner, who is mostly an employee of the mine, will then transport the material from the mine by bag or by other methods and sell it to a middleman. Runners tend to have a wide network of black market contacts, including illicit smelters.Level 2 “the middleman”The middleman buys considerable volumes of PGMs from the runners. The middleman crushes the PGMs into smaller pieces and packages it for the national buyers, before delivery.Level 3 “national buyers”The national buyers are mostly based in the RSA and they buy the PGM’S from the level 1 and 2’s. These buyers appear to be the link between the runners and more sophisticated syndicates who constitute the next level in the hierarchy of the criminal operators. These buyers are often the agents of the more sophisticated syndicate or they operate as independent couriers for such syndicates. Their task is to buy and transport the material from the middleman to wealthy local syndicate leaders.Level 4 “the local syndicate leader”The syndicate leader / buyer use a fronting company, usually a Scrap Metal dealer to export the product from the RSA. The PGM stocks that they have purchased from various sources are processed, containerised or packaged and then sold to local or international contacts. Processing allows for detailed records to be kept by the syndicate leaders from whom the product is bought and samples are also takenfor analysis (assay) to determine value and PGM content. Storage bags/drums are weighed, marked and sealed. Smaller high value PGM parcels are exported using a courier network and bulk tonnage of PGM is containerised and either flown or shipped from the RSA. Misrepresentations are made to customs by undervaluing and falsifying the nature of the consignment. This then successfully overcomes the requirements for prescribed permits and licences to possess transport and deal in the product as required by the Act.Level 5 “the international buyers”The international contacts are situated abroad. The international market for unwrought PGM’s appears to be more attractive than the South African market as it is unregulated. Sophisticated networks, consisting of legal persons and entities register to deal in PGMs have been established abroad to deal with the imports and proceeds derived from the sale after being sold to the refiners in Western Europe, United Kingdom and Canada, capable of refining the product for commercial use. It appears that the ultimate destination is inevitably a buyer abroad rather than someone in South Africa.Note: The current syndicate under discussion were classified as level 3 to 5 operators.Legal entities involved in the case:1. Group members and others employed by or associated with the group, procured unwrought precious metals (PGMs), comprising platinum in the main from mines in South Africa, especially the Rustenburg area, where after samples thereof would be assayed by legal entities and/or persons to determine content and value, where after it would be exported to Just Refiners and Technology, UK or to a company styled as an international freight forwarding company, based in Felixstowe, Suffolk, United Kingdom, Canada and elsewhere.2. Before being dispatched by front companies especially used as part of the concealment of the illicit PGMs, the PGMs would be stored and packed into containers for export purposes in various warehouses in and around Johannesburg. If of large quantity it would then be shipped from Durban and if of smaller quantity from Johannesburg airport.3. Before being shipped, documentation for export purposes containing false information regarding content, value and/or exporter would be prepared and presented to the authorities.4. With reference to certain of the charges, Boekhoud would cause the unwrought precious metals to be assayed upon receipt in the United Kingdom at a company based in Sheffield, United Kingdom, and then upon receipt of the correct values of the product prepare or cause to be prepared so – called self – billing invoices and inform the exporters of the true value and content. Boekhoud, would then, having been provided with banking details by V Naidoo or Hoosan, remit the proceeds of sales to accounts as directed.When acting as they did the accused acted with a common purpose to commit the offences charged with.5. The Accused and others were a group of individuals associated in fact with one another for purposes of obtaining monetary benefits by means of engaging in illegal procurement and smuggling of unwrought precious metals, and, as such, their association in fact constituted an enterprise as defined in section 1(1) (v) of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, 121 of 1998.6. V Naidoo was the leader of the group. He was actively involved in the procurement and dispatch phases of unwrought precious metals and directing where proceeds from sales were to be remitted to.7. Boekhoud was a director and shareholder of a company styled Just Refiners & Technology Ltd, based in Ramsey, Huntingdon in the United Kingdom (“JRT, UK”). JRT, UK received, refined and disposed of the unwrought precious metals at a profit on behalf of the group. Boekhoud was a member of or associated with the group until the end of 2001.8. R Naidoo, a younger brother of V Naidoo, assisted in the procurement of unwrought precious metals and in storing such before being exported to the United Kingdom, Canada or elsewhere.9. R Moonian assisted in the procurement and storing of unwrought precious metals before disposal.10. Longhow collected and caused to be sampled unwrought precious metals on behalf of the enterprise during the period 2000 to 2001, where after he left the group with Kevin Naidoo (the younger brother of V Naidoo and R Naidoo) and formed a new group involved in the same activities.11. Y Chetty collected and caused to be sampled unwrought precious metals on behalf of the group.12. Hoosan procured unwrought precious metals on behalf of the group. He also, on occasion, directly or indirectly, informed accused 1 as to where the proceeds of sales of unwrought precious metals were to be remitted into international bank accounts and also assisted the syndicate to trade with the proceeds of crime in exchange for South African currency (using a havala type informal banking scheme)13. James procured PGMs and was the accountant for his brother in law, Boekhoud and JRT.14. There were also other individuals employed by or associated with the group from time to time, who assisted in the procurement, transportation or disposal of unwrought precious metals.",other crimes,0
"OverviewIn June 2016, inside the Makana Resort in Grahamstown South Africa, three men were arrested by the South African Police Service (SAPS) as part of a wider police operation called Full Moon. The three accused were caught red-handed, carrying a freshly removed 10.7kg rhino horn, a tranquilizer dart gun including darts and tranquilizers, a bow saw, ammunition, knives, side cutters, a cordless drill, and several phones and sim cards.The investigation of the case could link the accused to 13 separate incidents of alleged rhino poaching which took place between 2013 and 2016. In April 2019, all three accused were found guilty on 50 counts and sentenced to 25 years in prison each.DetailsIn June 2016 the white rhino Cambell was killed and his horn was taken at a farm in the district of Albany, South Africa. A post-mortem examination into the death of Cambell was initiated. The bull was lying in a large pool of blood with blood tainted foam located on its right side with the front horn missing. The sinuses and airways were exposed when the horn was removed, which was done using a sharp serrated blade. From the injuries it became apparent that the rhino was still alive during the procedure. Furthermore, the examination concluded that in the absence of a bullet entry into the rhino’s body, it had been immobilized by the use of a highly potent drug. The death of the animal was caused by the damage to tissues and blood vessels, the resulting blood loss along with the amount of pain.As part of the operation Full Moon, an operation named after the fact that many rhino killings take place during periods of full moon, the South African Police Service (SAPS) arrested three men in the night of 17 June 2016. The three accused Jabulani John Ndlovu (accused 1), Forget Ndlovu (accused 2) and Sibusiso Sani Ndlovu (accused 3) were arrested in Grahamstown, South Africa. At the time of their arrest, several items used for rhino poaching operations were found in their chalet, including a freshly removed rhino horn and a saw (see full list below).Further investigations found that the freshly harvested horn belonged to the white rhino Cambell. DNA material of the horn was also found on the saw seized during the arrest. During the course of the investigation, the poaching of Cambell was linked to nine other rhino killings which took place between 2013 and 2016 in several districts in South Africa. The post-mortem examinations of all crime scenes concluded the same modus operandi had been used for the killing and harvesting of the rhinos and their horns. In particular, the modus operandi encompassed: the incidents took place during the period of the full moon; tracks of two persons were found at each crime scene; dart guns and a specific dart (Pnew dart) were used; all rhinos were tranquilized using Etorphine and/or Thiafentanil; and the horns were removed in a specific manner with a saw. In some instances, the rhinos were heavily pregnant, in which cases the sub-adults’ horns had been removed in the same way as their mothers’. Moreover, cell phone data of the accused phones showed that the phones were used in timely and spatial proximity to the previous poaching incidents.The accused were charged with ten separate incidents of alleged rhino poaching, including 50 counts related to these. In March 2019, the accused were found guilty on ten counts of theft; ten counts of carrying out a restricted activity involving a specimen of a protected species without a permit; ten counts of illegal hunting; ten counts of the possession of a scheduled substance; ten counts of unlawful possession of ammunition. Furthermore, 15 other counts on three separate poaching incidents that were initially on the charge sheet were separated and bound for another trial.One month later, on 3 April 2019, the High Court of South Africa sentenced each of the accused to 25 years imprisonment.",trafficking in firearms,0
"According to her statements, V1 was probably 26 years old when her exposure to drugs began. In her childhood, she was molested by someone close to her family. This had a great impact on her life as an adult person. She felt unloved and dirty. To cope she took her mother’s prescription medicine, anti-depressants and sleeping tablets. Her first marriage was abusive, and she divorced her husband whilst expecting her first child. By this time, she was a full corporal working as a chef at the air force base. She turned to alcohol and stated that she was becoming an alcoholic. Her friendship with a certain sergeant, a male work colleague lead to her introduction to the sordid world of hard drugs. The sergeant took her to a Nigerian dealer in Sunnyside, Pretoria. He taught her how the drug, which she came to know as ‘rocks’ was smoked using a glass pipe. She enjoyed the experience of drug-induced happiness and over time, her cravings grew. From once a month to once a week, they made more frequent trips to Sunnyside to obtain drugs. Eventually she found herself smoking drugs every other day. Her salary of R4700.00 could not fund her addiction and she borrowed money and began selling her household goods. The sergeant suggested that if she agreed to have sex with the dealer they would get a free supply of drugs. This exchange of sex for drugs extended to other Nigerian dealers as well. Eventually she began going out on her own to obtain drugs.It was during one such outing that she was taken in by a certain Nigerian dealer when she found herself stranded at night as her motor bike needed repairs. Under the guise of offering to help her, she was taken to his flat and given more drugs. From then onwards she never returned home permanently. Because she was absent without leave, she lost her job. She went on to recount a detailed train of events, which eventually resulted in her being taken in by the accused. The details are omitted only to the extent that bear light on her transformation from drug addict to becoming a fully-fledged sex slave. The person who assisted her with her motor bike had other girls living in his flat. She was given clothes and taught how to work the streets as a prostitute. Her every movement was monitored and all income she made was taken from her. Depending on how much money she made she received rocks in exchange.She was sold to another Nigerian dealer known as Omeka who took her off the streets and advertised her body on the internet. She was photographed, and advertisements were placed offering her sexual services. She stayed here for several months and made a lot of money for the dealer.  When she managed to return to Sunnyside she met a Nigerian who she referred to as ‘Uncle’. He supplied her with rocks in exchange for her working for him as a prostitute. She thereafter was passed on and worked for another Nigerian called John during which time she realised she was pregnant. She was not allowed to leave the house and did not have many clients. Because she was not making any money John sold her to the accused.She occupied the accused’s 2-bedroom flat with a Coloured woman and a Nigerian man. She shared one room with the accused and the other couple the other. She had sexual intercourse with the accused to obtain drugs. The pattern of her lifestyle was the same – her body was advertised in provocative poses on the internet after being photographed in skimpy underwear. Men would make appointments for sex after viewing the site. Advertisements were placed on sites such as Sex Trader, Escort South Africa and Red Velvet. She had no choice in the matter. The men would call at the flat where the sexual encounters took place. Her other chores included cleaning the flat and making food. Initially she remained locked in with the Nigerian keeping guard over them. The accused collected her earnings in the evenings when he returned. In exchange, he gave her rocks for half the value of the money earned. She was unable to say whether he had any other source of income. The accused became angry if she did not see clients and bring in money. She saw 4 to 5 clients a day at a rate of R400.00 for half an hour and R500.00 for an hour. Her sole motivation to see clients was to make money for the accused to obtain drugs and sustain her addiction. Her morning drug doze, which she called the ‘wake up’ drug, was provided free by the accused and so was the evening drug, which she referred to as the ‘sleeper’.She believed that the accused was her pimp. All money earned was collected by the accused who gave her drugs in exchange. She stated that the accused used her earnings to pay the rent, buy food, toiletries and clothes for her, as she had to look good for the clients. The accused kept the rest of the money for himself.  There was a time on her birthday that the accused took her to a shopping centre to see her parents for about 15 minutes whilst keeping her under observation all the time. She did not disclose that she was being kept against her will by the accused. They lived in Faerie Glen at that time. Because she was given a cell phone so that clients could contact her, she was able to contact the Welfare regarding the birth of her child. In the accused’s absence, she left to stay at this welfare home for a week where her child was born. She stated that for a while she overcame the cravings to take any drugs, as having the child was more important to her. She decided against putting the child up for adoption and returned to live with her parents. She was even able to find work as a receptionist for a month or two. However, her addiction overcame her and on a trip one evening to buy drugs, the accused traced her and forcefully took her to Silverton. She began living there with the accused and a certain KC, who was also Nigerian. The accused again arranged for her to see clients after she was advertised on the sex website. KC manufactured drugs in the kitchen and sold it to the accused. She estimated that she made approximately R40 000.0 a month and all of this went to the accused. Her movements were severely restricted, and she was effectively locked up in the building. The accused threatened to kill her if she tried to run away again. Thereafter they moved to a flat in Silversands.V1 narrated an incident about an assault when the accused followed her to a flat where she was severely beaten. He hit her using his fists and open hands, kicked her on her ribs, beat her with a dog chain and stick all over her body. She was no longer on speaking terms with her parents who blamed her for leaving her children. In her loneliness, she explained that she turned to making the accused’s life happy so that her life could be happy. There were many instances when he assaulted her and punished her by not giving her drugs. He manipulated her emotionally and made her believe that she was worthless. When they moved to Loskop Street, she was able to escape in the boot of the car of the client of another girl. She returned to her parent’s home and stayed there for a long time. Her third daughter was born during this time. She reverted to using drugs again. The accused came across her one evening when she went to buy drugs and took her back with him. She had earlier incurred a drug debt with a certain Nigerian dealer called JJ who held her motor bike as security for payment. The accused made this payment of R2000.00 on her behalf after she was escorted by force to his car. The arrangements were that she would live with a certain Chooks for a while and that her bike would be collected later.During her stay with Chooks, she reverted to prostitution through the internet and received her daily supply of drugs. Chooks became her new pimp for a while, although she later found out that the money was shared with the accused. The accused got to know that Chooks made a lot of money from the clients which she picked up from a local bar and took her away to live in Elarduspark, which was the home of a certain Cheedi, a person the accused worked for when he arrived in South Africa. They rented a room there. There were other prostitutes in the house. Because the accused failed to pay the rent, they left to live in a flat in Sunnyside. A certain Charles owned this flat and 4 or 5 other prostitutes occupied it. The ladies worked the streets for clients. The accused kept guard over V1, who worked on the internet and the streets.Eventually, they moved to Sandalwood Road, Newlands. She and the accused occupied the bottom level. This was the address where the accused was arrested. This was also the address where the 2nd complainant V2 came to live a few months later. V2 was an 18-year-old drug addict recruited by Chooks for which he also got a share of her earnings as a prostitute. She believed that the accused had sex with V2 the evening she arrived because she came across a condom.  She had no knowledge of any rape. The accused continued to make more money with two girls working. They saw more clients here and made more money all of which the accused controlled. The girls were advertised in newspapers and the internet. All sexual activities took place in exchange for drugs supplied by the accused at this venue rented by the accused. When the clients called at the premises, the accused would lurk in the background so that he was not seen but he always was informed what was going on. The witness was shown a bundle of cell phone records, but she was unable to confirm that any of the names appearing therein were used by her or related to her.She contacted her parents through Facebook and arranged to go to the Children’s Court in Pretoria North to sign off her last born so that her parents would become legal guardians of her child. It was before magistrate Hitchcock that she made a full disclosure which caused the magistrate to report the matter to the Hawks. V1 accompanied the officers to point out the premises where the accused was arrested. She was thereafter in protective custody.Under cross examination she denied that the accused was the father of her second born child. She conceded that the only reason she continued to stay on with the drug dealers was because of her drug addiction and she believed that she was acting out of her own free will at the time. She denied that her working as a prostitute was due to an arrangement she had with the accused. It was put to her that she was not forced to see clients and she only did so get money for her addiction. She denied this. She clarified that her wake up and sleeper drugs were given to her by the accused free of charge. However, if she did not see clients she was not given food, and something was taken away from her as punishment. She further conceded that although opportunities presented itself for her to run away from the accused, the accused made threats to kill her family if she ever tried to run away and he had her motor cycle.There was a time when her father reported her missing to the police. She was questioned about a police raid, which took place whilst living in Elarduspark, which created an opportunity for her to make a report to the police. She affirmed that she did so, but they returned her to the accused. This made her lose all faith and hope in their ability to help her. The accused maintained that after she left, it was she who contacted him to settle her debts, which he did to stop her working on the streets. She denied this and maintained that it created a further obligation to advertise her on the internet and force her to offer her sexual services over a long time.Statements of V2According to her statements, V2 was 6 months old when she, together with her sisters and brother were placed in the welfare social system. This happened after she was raped by her father. Her mother became a prostitute. She was then moved to another home, which separated her from her siblings. From there she was placed in the Morester Children’s Home until she was 12 years old.  She was thereafter transferred to the Catherine Robinson Children’s Home in Vereeniging. Here she was subjected to bullying and mockery which resulted in her getting into fights with other learners. At the Home she associated with a group of girls she described as ‘wrong friends’. One in the group introduced the rest to start smoking dagga. They absconded from school for 3 months to live with a certain Aunty Baby who owned a pub. Their intention was to go on a drinking spree. She made acquaintances at the pub during this time that paid for the drinks. The police located them, and they returned to the school. She was then introduced to mandrax and ended up using drugs. A Nigerian man abducted her from school and took her to an unknown location where she was kept. She stated that they forced her to smoke drugs after being assaulted.V2 described a certain Charles as one of the Nigerians from Vereeniging who sold girls. She regarded him as her boss who was nice and believed at the time she was in love with him. Charles sold her to a person called Austin. He became her boss and she was attracted to him. According to her evidence she also fell in love with Austin and had a sexual relationship with him. She began working as a prostitute for Austin under threat that her family will be harmed. She was sold back to Charles after Austin made a girl pregnant. Both Austin and Charles had drug dealings. Thereafter Charles sold her for R5000.00 to a person called Allaji. She described Allaji as one of the big bosses from Nigeria. His street name was Kenneth. She was taken to his flat at an unknown location and put to work as a prostitute. He already had 5 girls working as prostitutes. All of them were beaten up. He had a hold over her because of the drugs he supplied to her and expected her to pay him back from her earnings as a prostitute. She was also given a ‘wake up’ drug in the morning, in the afternoon and a ‘sleeper’ doze at night. Her addiction to crystal meth led to severe cravings.    Initially she worked on the streets and was then photographed and advertised on the internet offering sexual services. She was 16 at that stage. The clients would call her directly and make a booking. After they paid her, the money was handed to Allaji. After 5 years she managed to escape. After staying a week with her aunt, she arranged to meet a certain person called Moody whom she earlier knew. She arranged to meet him in Johannesburg but encountered a certain person called Chooks instead. Chooks, who was also Nigerian showed an interest in her and offered that she stays with him. He brought her to Pretoria and that is how she met the accused and the first complainant V1. They were living in a one room flat with a bathroom. Chooks left her there and returned to Johannesburg. It was V1 who told her that Chooks had sold her to the accused. She smoked rocks with V1. Because V1 had to see a client, she waited with the accused in another outside room. The accused told her that he loved her and wished to sleep with her. She refused. The accused again made sexual advances towards her which she again refused. He then forced himself on her, removed her clothes, put on a condom and had sexual intercourse with her against her will. She stated that at this moment, she ‘switched off’ which was understood to mean that she did not resist and she said because she felt nobody cared. She had an experience of being raped as a 13-year-old at gun point. She did not seek help from V1 because she sensed that V1 was as afraid of the accused as she was. Even the next morning, although V1 came across the condom in the bin, she did not disclose that she was raped, as she feared for her life. The accused arranged for Estcourt South Africa to photograph her. Pictures were taken of her in her underwear posing in different provocative positions. The pictures were paid for by the accused and she received many clients in response to the advertisement.The accused fixed her service rate at R400.00 for half an hour and R800.00 for an hour’s sex. The money earned was handed to the accused. She was given a cell phone to make the bookings. She did not contact her Aunt because she did not have her number. She was too scared to run away from the accused. She recalled how she was beaten by Allaji.She also narrated the events relating to further incident when the accused raped her. This happened during the evening shortly before the accused was arrested for the present case. She had earlier seen a client and called the accused to give him the money. He came by 6pm and wanted to have sex with her. She refused. He then forced himself on her and had sexual intercourse with her in the same manner as he did before. In exchange for the money she earned he gave her a ‘sleeper’ drug. She stated that it had been part of the rules she knew living with the Nigerians that all the money was given to them or you would be beaten up. The accused also threatened to assault her, and she feared that if she refused to work for him, her life would be in danger. Food in the house was scarce and sometimes she ate once a day.She was not allowed to go anywhere, and clients contacted her by cell phone. The language she used in court when describing the accused showed an intense hatred she bore for what he put her through. When asked if she though V1 feared the accused, her answer was a ‘deadly yes’. Apart from seeing clients, she also had to clean the house. The three weeks she lived there, she saw up to 5 clients a day. At times, she made up to R4000.00 a day for the accused.She was wearing a very revealing outfit before the police arrived. The accused bought that outfit because he wanted her to look sexy for clients. When the police knocked on the door, she hid the glass pipe and the drug pieces, were flushed down the toilet. She was high on drugs at the time and had consumed alcohol. Warrant officer Qegu took her to the bathroom where she showed her what she had hidden. She was hysterical at this stage. The officer asked her to pack her things and covered with a blanket. When they got to the car, she saw V1 hiding in the car. They were then taken to a safe house where they stayed for 6 months.Testimony of Warrant officersWarrant officers Qegu and Sithole testified about the events, which led to the arrest of the accused and the rescue of the 2nd complainant. Both officers were part of the Hawks unit and specially trained to work in the field of human trafficking. Qegu was with Sithole when they were assigned to attend to a case at Pretoria North Children’s Court. Qegu testified that she and Sithole attended court and met with magistrate Hitchcock who had made the report for police intervention. They also met V1, the 1st complainant there. She informed them how she and the 2nd complainant were being kept by the accused as sex workers against their will. The officers went to this venue after V1 made a call to establish that the accused was there. V1 pointed out the house but remained hidden in the vehicle. Before gaining entry to the accused premises she warned the girl inside not to run away as they were the police. The accused took some time to let them in.Except for a pair of pants, the accused was naked. The other person in the room was V2, who was very scantily dressed sitting on the bed drinking a beer. Because of the way the victim was dressed she took her to the bathroom whilst Sithole dealt with the accused. She described V2’s condition as being in a state of shock, disorientated and mostly incoherent. It appeared as if she was drunk or on drugs and was laughing for no reason. In the bathroom, V2 told her that shortly before the accused had given her drugs, which she smoked, he had sexual intercourse with her without consent. The accused told her to flush the rest of those drugs down the toilet when the officers knocked on the door. A glass pipe was found in the bathroom cabinet, which was placed in a sealed forensic exhibit bag. On inspection, a trace of a white powder-like substance was detected on the toilet seat. There was no food in the fridge.Both complainants were taken to a safe house and the accused was taken to the Brooklyn police station where he was charged the following day. The complainants were taken for medico legal examinations on the 14 May 2013 being the first available date. At the safe house, both complainants showed signs of drug withdrawal symptoms. V1 had red rashes on her body and V2 required specialist examination of her stomach. She arranged for victim impact reports to be compiled by police psychologist Major Stollarz.The witness stated that she booked out the exhibit bag of the evidence collected on the scene and took to the laboratory for forensic analysis. The analysis determined that it contained cocaine. The witness attempted to verify the address in Thembisa furnished by the accused where he allegedly worked. It led them to a Gold Exchange business. The owner, who also happened to be Nigerian, was questioned and he stated that he did not know the accused.Also booked into the SAP 13 register were all cell phones recovered from the accused and victims. These were sent for the data to be downloaded. The witness concluded her testimony by referring to a set of documents, some of which she obtained from V1 and some of which were found at the accused residence. These related to placement advertisements for sexual services under different names with deposit slips and receipts as proof of payment made to Sex Trader and Escort SA. All exhibits were handed in free of objection from the defence. In cross-examination, it was put to the witness that the accused knew nothing about the glass pipe, had not seen it before and did not hand it to V2. The witness’s explanation for the delay in taking V2 for a medico legal examination was that the events fell over a weekend and she stayed alone with her child. No other officer was available to take her to the doctor. It was put to the witness that the rape allegation was made only to make the case look stronger; the accused never had sexual intercourse with the victim on the day in question. He maintained that there was food in the fridge. It was also put to her that the accused would say that he had no knowledge of the documents relating to the advertisements in Sex Trader and Escort SA and saw them for the first time in court. He denied that the cell phone numbers appearing on the receipts were his.Warrant Officer Sithole’s testified and his evidence was in line with that of the testimony of Qegu. He confirmed that on meeting V1 she informed them that from 2009 the accused forced her to stay with him and used her as a sex worker. He stated that he did notice that the complainant was wearing lingerie and struggling to walk. Qegu took her into the bathroom. She was talking loudly, laughing and he did not find anything on the accused’s possession. In cross-examination, Sithole stated that Qegu informed him about the glass pipe she found when they were leaving the scene. After obtaining the accused’s consent, the witness read the accused’s entire Warning Statement, which he took on the day following the arrest into the record and it was received into evidence.As a follow-up to the Warning Statement he enquired and was informed by V1 that it was the accused who took away her motor bike. Under cross-examination and according to the witness’s recall, V2 told them that the accused had just finished raping her when they entered the room. It was also put to Sithole that the reason for the delay in having the medical examination done was to find something to link the accused to the offence. The defence introduced into evidence a map and set of photographs of the accused’s residence in Sandalwood Road for the purposes of showing the walking distance from the complex to the security point and the shopping centre.Testimony of the clinical psychologistMajor Stollarz, a clinical psychologist, testified as an expert witness. She adduced evidence based on a victimology report, which she complied at the request of the state. The purpose of her report and evidence was to assist the court in understanding the behaviour of victims of human trafficking from a psychological point of view, and to do so about the two complainants in the case. The conclusion she reached in her report was that ‘the complainants in the present matter were both, due to a number of developmental factors and traumas, and their abuse of substances, vulnerable to becoming victims of human trafficking. During the time that led up to their rescue they were subjected to witnessing and experiencing physical and sexual violence, threats, and encouragement of their addictions. Neither complainant wished to remain in the environment that they were in, but believed that they were unable to leave due to a number of psychological factors regarding the accused control over them, which included their fear of their own, or their families’ safety, substance addiction and lack of other viable alternatives. These victims were therefore exposed to the typical mechanisms used by traffickers to keep their victims in a web of trafficking that extended beyond the mere physical control to the expansive grip of psychological control’. There was no challenge to her testimony – the defence recorded that the accused had no objections and she was not cross-examined on her evidence. No additional psychiatric or other expert evidence was presented to the court.Statements of the accusedThe accused testified that he was born in Nigeria and came to South Africa in 2006. He entered South Africa on a visitor’s permit and later sought asylum as a refugee to reside legally in the country. One day, he met V1 by chance whilst walking in Sunnyside. He stopped her and spoke to her. She told him she was divorced, had one child and stayed in Pretoria North with her parents. She also informed him that she was a prostitute working on the streets, as she needed money to buy drugs. He told her it was ok because he loved her. He told her he liked her and wanted her to be his girlfriend. She agreed, and they began dating. They were in a relationship and she once slept over at his place. She took him to her home to meet her parents and they became very close. She also wanted to stay with him in Sunnyside and he agreed.By the end of 2009, they began living together. The accused stated that because he worked in Thembisa, he would leave home in the morning and return in the evening. He suspected that for the first 3 months together she continued being a prostitute because she was not home in the evenings. When he confronted her about this and she left to live with her parents. In this time, the accused informed her that he had moved to live in Faerie Glen. She returned to live with him and he did not want her engaging in prostitution anymore. She returned to live with her parents and began working as a receptionist for about 4 months. They continued seeing each other during this time and she was expecting his child in 2010. She alternated between staying with the accused and her parents. After giving birth, he visited the baby at her parent’s home. During February 2011 she brought the baby over and stayed with the accused for 2 weeks before going back to live with her parents. The accused then moved to live with a friend in Loskop Street. During this time, he was sending money to her using Shoprite money market. The reason she stayed there was because she had a sickly daughter. During 2013, she called him from Sunnyside for financial help as she had pawned her motor bike to buy drugs. He paid to have this bike released and she began living with him. He kept her bike away from her to avoid her using it again to obtain drugs. However, he allowed her to use it to visit her parents. V1 then returned to her parent’s home and the accused moved to live in Sandalwood Drive. Two months later, she called him to get directions to his new residence. They began living happily together once again. He had no idea what she whilst he was at work.One day she asked for money to place an advert offering her sexual services as she was bored staying alone and did not want to work on the streets. He refused. Two days later, he saw receipts for payments from newspapers and the internet relating to such adverts. He confronted her, and she confirmed that these related to her. He started discovering used condoms in the house and realised she was still engaging in prostitution. Although he wanted her to leave, he allowed her to stay on out of love. There was a time when her mother visited on a Sunday and they all spent time together. She even accompanied them to the mall and did shopping. He always ensured there were groceries in the house and they lived happily without any problems as ‘boyfriend and girlfriend’.Regarding the main charge of human trafficking, he maintained that V1 was his girlfriend with whom he had a child and they were in love. She was in contact with her family. They shared a bond. She had keys to the premises and could come and go as she pleased. He had his own business from which he made money and provided for her and their child. The income from managing the sale of broken gold and diamonds business brought in a high profit. At times he earned up to R10 000.00 a month and he also got money from gambling.  This enabled him to pay the rent, buy a car and see to his expenses. He received no money from her and earned no money off her. He had never supplied her with drugs and had no idea how and from where she got it. On a question by the court at the end of his testimony, he admitted that she told him she bought “rocks” from Arcadia or Sunnyside. She used drugs without him knowing or seeing her use it. She engaged in prostitution only to buy drugs, as there was always food in the house. Only on one occasion, did he see and become aware that a client came to the house for sexual favours. He denied ever having assaulted her.Regarding V2, he stated that he knew her boyfriend Chooks and that is how he met her. Chooks had moved to Pretoria from Johannesburg and was looking out for a place where his girlfriend could live for a while. Both he and V1 agreed that V2 could stay with them. According to his evidence, she was only there for 3 weeks. He was aware that she was originally from Vereeniging, but was staying in Johannesburg. He denied having bought V1 from his friend and stated that had no personal relationship with her. He had no knowledge that she was a prostitute or that she was advertised on the internet as he was not home most of the time. He also knew nothing about her drug addiction and denied having supplied her with any drugs. He strongly denied the allegations that he had raped her on two occasions and did not know why she said this. According to him, V2 was surprised and questioned the police as to why the accused was being arrested, as V1 was the accused’s boyfriend. For days after his arrest, the police also mention nothing concerning a charge of rape. He got to know for the first time of such charge in court.According to him, if the police found a pipe in the bathroom they would have shown it to him and asked for an explanation. He denied that any drugs were found by the police.In cross-examination, it emerged that he came on a visiting visa, and did not apply for a business one although he started his own business at the end of 2006. He could not say with certainty when he obtained his asylum permit or where his passport was. He could not explain why his brother at the gold exchange business told the police he was not working there. Thereafter he was examined regarding V1’s version and his responses were a denial, either that he had no knowledge or could not comment on it. He did confirm that V1 explained to him and he knew what “rocks” were, but he had not seen these drugs. At first, he stated that he noticed a change in her behaviour when she used drugs and he knew exactly when she was using drugs because she broke out into boils on her face and body. He had often seen her in a drugged state. Under later examination, he stated that she never showed any difference in behaviour if she did not use drugs. He held the belief that no person addicted to drugs could be controlled and that a drug addict could stop taking drugs anytime they chose unless they liked taking drugs.Regarding V2, his earlier testimony was that he had no knowledge that she was a prostitute or that she was advertised on the internet as he was not home most of the time. Under cross-examination, he stated that V1 informed him that V2 had joined her on the internet. Although he stated that he never saw her getting visitors for sexual favours, this new version was in stark contrast with what he had previously said. He stated that he was fully dressed when the police came to arrest him. He denied that Warrant officer Qegu, before gaining entry to his premises, issued any warning to V2 not to run as they came to rescue her. Further, V2 was trying to defend him by offering an explanation but the police told her not to get involved. He denied that V2 was in the condition she was as described by the police officers at the time of his arrest. His evidence was that V2 was coached and told to say all the things she testified about and she told the police on the scene that they were arresting the wrong person. He disputed that the glass pipe containing traces of drugs was found in his premises because it was not shown to him. Likewise, he stated that if V2 told the officer she was raped they would have told him about it and he only got to know about this charge in court. When it was pointed out to him that the offence of rape appeared in paragraph 2 of his warning Statement, his response was that he was never asked if he understood it at the time. He further denied that he signed that relevant portion of the statement. His explanation why both complainants made the same allegations against him was that they probably discussed it to implicate him. He could not explain why he was not registered as a taxpayer although on his version he earned R10 000.00 a month. When asked why his name on the Asylum Permit was different to the name he gave on the warning statement, he said it was a mistake, which was not corrected. In re-examination, he explained that it was a spelling error made by official at Home Affairs.",trafficking in persons,0
"The appellant's version was that she met the three complainants on the beach near Maputo in Mozambique where the complainants worked as prostitutes. They told her that they wanted to work as prostitutes in South Africa. She then agreed to accommodate the complainants as prostitutes in Pretoria where she resided. The appellant had a hair salon in the central business district of Pretoria where she also sold clothing. From the evidence, it is clear that the appellant knew the complainants from Mozambique. The appellant commuted between Pretoria and Mozambique regularly to visit and sell clothing. When she returned from Mozambique after one of her trips and while the appellant was in Pretoria, one of the complainants phoned the appellant and said that they were near Komatipoort. The appellant testified that she then asked a friend of hers to transport the complainants to Pretoria. When they arrived in Pretoria, the three complainants stayed with the appellant in her flat in Silver Lakes, east of Pretoria. The flat was too small and the appellant decided to rent a 3-bedroom house in Moreleta Park, a short distance from her flat. A brothel was kept at that house. The appellant was arrested and some of the complainants were taken into custody there. The Regional Magistrate rejected the appellant's evidence on grounds of credibility. Her rejected evidence only differed from that of the complainants in respect of the complainants' alleged prostitution in Mozambique and the collection of the complainants near Komatipoort. The balance of the evidence that led to the appellant's conviction (which she never challenged on appeal) was based to a large extent on circumstantial evidence. The evidence of the complainants was accepted. Their evidence was that they did meet the appellant in Mozambique where she promised them work in her hair salon and an opportunity to study while working there. They were looking for a better life. She then arranged for them to come to South Africa and the appellant in person collected all three of them at or near Komatipoort. The complainants testified that they worked for the appellant at her hair salon in Pretoria for a few days. They were forced to smoke cannabis and to have sexual intercourse with several men daily. They said they were not paid for doing so.One of the complainants returned to Mozambique before the appellant's arrest. She returned because she refused to perform all the sexual acts demanded by the appellant's elderly male clients. She was whisked away from the appellant's establishment and transported by taxi to Mozambique. She was given a passport containing the photograph of another individual to pass through immigration counters at the border posts. The passport was, when she was dropped off in Maputo, taken back by the taxi driver. After she reported her ordeal to her boyfriend and family in Maputo (her boyfriend gave evidence in the Court a quo) they went to the Mozambican Police to report the incident. After having reported the incident, the policeman to whom it was reported demanded payment of money from the victim and her relatives and boyfriend before he would conduct an investigation. The investigation only later followed after the victim and her boyfriend contacted a senior police official in Mozambique who then, in collaboration with the South African Police Service, secured the appellant's prosecution.",trafficking in persons,1

"The accused, Mr Veeran Palan and Ms Edwina Norris are charged with ten (10) counts which include: Count 1 and 2 is the illegal and intentional trafficking for sexual of complainant 1 and 2 in contravention of section 71(1) of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and related Matters) Amendment Act, 32 of 2007.Count 3 is the illegal keeping of a brothel in contravention of S2 of the Sexual Offences Act 23 of 1957.Count 4 and 5 is the charge of procuring the two complainants to have unlawful carnal intercourse with someone else in contravention of s a, b, and C of s10 of the sexual Offences Act 23 of 1957Count 6 is knowingly acquire, possess or use the illegal proceeds from acts of prostitutionCount 7 and 8 is kidnappingCount 9 and 10 is conspiring with an unidentifiable person to commit sexual offence. The crime of trafficking was prosecuted in terms of section 70 of the Sexual Offences Act, 32 of 2007. The Prevention and Combatting of Trafficking in Persons Act 7 of 2013 was assented to by the President of the Republic of South Africa on 28 July 2013 but had not been enacted. The first complainant CB is a 29 year old wife and mother of four young children, testified that during 2013 she was living with her husband and four children in Cape Town. She was unemployed and with a grade 10 education it was difficult to find a job. During July 2013 accused 2’s mother approached her with a cell phone and said that accused 2 wanted to speak to her. She had known accused 2 for some 12 years because they had been at school together and lived in the same street. She knew that accused 2 was working away from her family home. Accused 2 offered her a job as a cleaner in a Margate hotel in KZN. CB was keen to earn an income and undertook to speak to her husband. Accused 2 promised to phone her again with more details. CB’s husband did not have a good feeling about the offer. Accused 2 thereafter phoned again and told CB that Vees, her employer, would buy her a ticket to travel to KZN by bus. CB arranged with her mother to take care of the children. Her mother undertook to obtain more information about the job from accused 2 and also from Vees. Later that day accused 2’s mother called CB to her again and she was shown a photograph of accused 2 in what appeared to be a waitress’s uniform. This finally persuaded CB to accept the job offer and she contacted accused 2 to tell her. She enquired about the salary she would receive and accused 2 told her that she would hear when she was there. CB spoke to her husband about the job offer and although he was initially not happy to let her go but told her that she could if she wanted to. He too had spoken to accused 2.  On the 17th July 2013 she received a bus ticket confirmation by text from Vees. He also advised her that SN second complainant, also from Cape Town, would accompany her. She knew SN. CB’s father searched the Internet and reported that there was a Margate hotel in the Port Shepstone area. She now was convinced that all was above board with the job offer.  The next morning her mother took her to the bus terminus in Cape Town and travelled with SN to Port Shepstone. During the journey she stayed in telephonic contact with her mother and with Vees. They arrived in Port Shepstone on the 19th July 2013 at 9.30 in the evening and phoned accused 2. Vees, who turned out to be accused 1, was there to pick them up. He took them to his home. She had no idea where the hotel was that she was to work at. She had never been to KZN. Accused 1’s wife was at the house and she showed the two women their bedrooms, told them to bath before they would have something to eat and said that accused 2 was still at work and would be there shortly. Accused 2 arrived with two other ladies, J and M. Accused 2 was not in a waitress uniform but like the other two ladies she was scantily dressed. CB and SN thought they were dressed like prostitutes. Accused 1 made them sit down at a table and then disclosed to them that they were in fact not there to work in a hotel but that they would work as prostitutes; that accused 2 and the other ladies worked for him as sex workers. He said that CB and SN had no option but to do it as well since they needed to pay for the bus tickets he had provided. It had cost R1200 apiece. CB did not know what to say. She was nervous because she had noticed a handgun tucked into the back of accused 1’s trousers. Prostitution was however unacceptable to her. Accused 2 did not say anything either. She asked accused 2 what was to happen and accused 2 apologized for having lied to CB and SN. She explained that she had to find a replacement for herself before she would be allowed to return to Cape Town. This was confirmed by accused 1.      Accused 1 wanted them to start working that very night but CB and SN said that they were too tired. CB sent her mother a text on her cell phone after 1 am to tell her what had happened. After breakfast the next morning accused 2 took them to a shopping centre and bought them provocative clothing and underwear. That afternoon they were taken to the house of accused 1’s friend, a Dr M where they were entertained with food and alcohol. In the meantime CB’s uncle S phoned SN’s phone. He wanted to know where CB was finding herself but she was unable to give any directions. That evening the women were told to put on the clothes and underwear bought for them. Four men arrived at the house and the five women were told to stand in a line. The other women were each picked by a man (including accused 2) and CB considered herself fortunate that no-one picked her. She remained in the dining room while the others went to the bedrooms for sex. J was the first to return and she received a call about a stag party. When the other women were done, accused 1 drove the six of them to a Lodge at the Crocodile farm. Five men approached accused 1 and enquired how much the party and the girls would cost. Accused 1 advised them that it would cost R1000 for a stripping session and R350 for half an hour with a girl. There were many men at what turned out to be a bachelor party. An Indian man approached CB for sex. He paid accused 1 R400 and took CB to a room. She however disclosed to him that she was not a prostitute and how it had happened that she landed up there. She made it clear that she did not want him to have sex with him. The man undertook to help her and they conversed. Accused 1 arrived after a while and said that time was up and the man had to leave. Accused 1 drove the girls, except for accused 2 who stayed at the party, back home. On the way J was dropped at Dr M’s house. There was further business and four men arrived. This time CB was chosen by one of the men. SN was also chosen but said she did not feel good about it. The man took CB to a room and again she explained that she was not a prostitute and that she was there against her will. The man said he just wanted to converse and did not want sex although he had paid accused 1 R350. CB and the man conversed and when they left the bedroom they found accused 1 and Samantha arguing. At that moment CB’s mother phoned accused 1. Accused 1 told her that CB was at work but her mother had heard CB’s voice and accused 1 then told her they had just arrived from work. Although he was angry he passed the phone to CB but remained in attendance. As a result CB was unable to tell her mother what was happening. She said to her mother that everything was fine and that she could contact her in the morning. Accused 1 was upset about the phone call because he felt that CB’s mother was messing with his business. He threatened CB. She did not end the call with the result that her mother could hear how accused 1 was arguing with her and SN.     Between 3 and 4 am accused 1’s son and two other youngsters arrived at the house. Accused 1 did not want his son to see him; so accused 1’s wife (who happened to be a lady of Chinese origin) attended to business. Accused 1’s son went to sit in the car outside and a 17 year old boy paid her R400 to have sex with CB. Once they were in the bedroom CB disclosed to the prospective customer that she did not want to engage in prostitution and did not want to have sex with him. The youngster insisted and removed her clothes and told her to give him a condom. When she would not, he took one from a table in the room, put it on and told her to lie down. She resisted but he pushed her onto her back on the bed and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her. Although she pushed him off her, he mounted and penetrated her once again. She managed to push him off once again and he left the room and complained to accused 1. Accused 1 came into the bedroom and told her that he would see her in the morning. The next morning accused 1 confronted her and SN. He was rude and said they owed him R250 each for the food consumed by them as well as another R100 for advertising their bodies on the Internet. They were also to pay for their accommodation. From the R150, R100 and R50 respectively which he had given her for having been with three customers, she gave him R200. Accused 2 suggested that they be taken to a pub but accused 1 did not want them to go out and drink. Accused 2 then lied to him and said they were going out to eat and go to the cinema. Four of them took a taxi to a pub and enjoyed a few drinks and the outing. Uncle S again phoned SN who then enquired from others what the name of the pub was and conveyed this to Uncle S. At that point accused 2 was outside with another man. Half an hour later two police officers arrived. One had a photograph of CB which uncle S had sent to them. He took CB and SN with him to the police station in Port Shepstone where they made statements. At some point accused 2, accused 1 and his wife arrived. Accused 1 demanded to know why the police had taken the women there. CB identified accused 1 to the police and he was arrested. Then they enquired which one was Bonnie and when accused 2 was pointed out, she too was arrested. CB and SN were taken to accused 1’s house to fetch their clothes. Accused 1s wife allowed them to. According to CB she had been afraid of accused 1 and his firearm and the manner in which he talked to them and therefore had not made an attempt to leave the house earlier. They were also watched by accused 1 and his wife. On one of the three occasions when she was picked by customers, she was too scared to refuse. One look at accused 1’s face persuaded her to oblige.  Her understanding was that while accused 1 made all the arrangements with men, his wife managed the prostitutes. She saw him receive all the money.      When asked in the course of cross-examination why she had not run away from the house of accused 1, she told the court that she was afraid to do so. She thought accused 1 to be well-connected and she did not know whom to trust. She at one point said that she could not think clearly The court found that the evidence clearly showed that accused 1 and 2 had employed deception to lure the two complainants to Port Shepstone for the purpose of getting them to engage in prostitution and provided the finances and means of transferring them here. They were also harboured and accommodated by accused 1. The women did not freely and with full knowledge of all the material facts consent thereto. Consequently both accused are found guilty of the main counts of trafficking, illegal keeping of a brothel, procuring the victims to have unlawful carnal intercourse, knowingly acquire, possess or use the illegal proceeds from acts of prostitution (accused 2 was acquitted of this charge) and kidnapping. The second accused were acquitted on count 9 and 10.  Accused 1 was sentenced to 10 years and a fine of R10,000 or 5 months imprisonment. Accused 2 was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment.",trafficking in persons,1
"The defendant, a 28 year old man, arranged a customary marriage with the complainant’s uncle which led to her abduction. The complainant was, at the time, 14 years old. The custom of abducting girls for the purposes of marriage, sometimes with the permission of their family, is known as ukuthwala in South Africa. The complainant was restrained and transported to the defendant’s village. She attempted to escape two times, and was successful the second time in arriving back to her village, but was subsequently apprehended by her uncle and returned to the defendant. She was then beaten and raped eight times, and was locked in the house when the defendant and his relatives were going out. After a few days, the complainant jumped over the fence and sought help from the police.",trafficking in persons,1
"With the exception of victim LK (counts 5 and 6), who was abducted under false pretences, three girls; JC, CM and AC (mentioned in counts 1-4 and 6-8), all under the age of 16 at the time, were through misrepresentations made to them and their parents lured to South Africa by a certain ‘Aunt Juliet Chauke’  to visit family and / or with the promise of their attending schools and obtaining a better education than what they could get in Mozambique. Accused no 2, Violet Chauke, is Juliet’s younger sister, while Alice Chauke, AC’s mother was Juliet’s elder sister.  According to the uncontested evidence of these children, Juliet Chauke, who has since disappeared back into Mozambique and never charged in this matter, has also ‘trafficked’ her younger sister Violet Chauke, to South Africa in a similar way, but, later, when she became adult, she got a work and remained in South Africa.JC was sent by her parents with Juliet and others to come and visit over the school holidays – also with a promise that she would return, which never happened. When she asked Juliet why she is not going back, she said that there was no money. AC was sent by her mother, Juliet’s and Violet’s elder sister to South Africa with a promise of better schooling, which never materialized – but she was never allowed to return. LK was abducted under false pretences after her primary care giver, her grandmother, refused Juliet permission to bring her to South Africa for better schooling. Later, however, Juliet found her on the way and told her that her grandmother had now agreed and, she was then made to accompany Juliet and others. She was also never enrolled at school in South Africa and not allowed to return. CM came to South Africa with Juliet in the presence of her own mother, Alice and her younger sister JM and others. The purported reason for their trip was to visit family members over the school holidays, after which they would return. Her mother returned, but she and her sister remained behind. When the mother later phoned and asked when they would be sent back, Juliet said that there was no money for that and that she would enrol them at school in South Africa. JC, AC and LK were brought to South Africa in 2009, while CM was brought during 2010.Since none of them had valid passports, all of them were at different occasions smuggled over or through the border fence with South Africa, while Juliet used the border gate with a valid passport. On the other side of the border they were met by Juliet and other people, (sometimes a man perceived to be Juliet’s husband) and they were eventually transported to the place called Makostering (Rhenosterhoek) plantation village. This lumberjacks’ village is a very remote place with no direction or information boards, and a stranger would find it difficult to find the place without help and would experience true desolation if left there without food or shelter. A desolated place indeed, and if a stranger was brought there and chased away, as some of these children were threatened should they not do what they were told, they would literally not have anywhere to go.Once resident in one of the small houses in the village, these girls were at different times, sometimes in the presence of others, taken (or sent) by Juliet, or fetched by accused no 1, to a larger house, about 1.5 kilometres away from the village, which reportedly belonged to accused no 1, the manager of the plantation / timber farm, and which was used as a residence by him. All of these witnesses described how they were then from time to time made to enter the bedroom, where they would be undressed (either by Juliet or accused no 1), or, later when they got used to it, they themselves did so, and they were also raped by accused no 1 on these occasions. All of them, with the exception of JC, who was raped only once, were raped several times according to their evidence. Each time they were being taken to the larger house by Juliet, or, later when they got used to their being exploited in this way, called or sent (by Juliet or, in her absence, by Violet, accused no 2) to go and attend accused no 1’s sexual pleasures. Sometimes he would pay Juliet, sometimes he would give them money to give to either Juliet or Violet, accused no 2. JC said that, when she was subsequent to her rape called to Mabuza’s house, she told the messengers that they should tell him that she is in her periods so that she did not have to go, and thus she evaded being raped a second time.Three of them (AC, CM and JC) testified that they were during the first time threatened by accused no 1 with a fire arm should they not do what he says. Some of them (excluding only AC who was at the very first time forced to do so) at first refused to sleep with Mabuza, accused no 1, after which they were threatened by Juliet that they would be chased away, that they would not have anywhere to go or food to eat and, sometimes food like meat would be refused. This motivated the children to simply do as they were told.It further emerged from the evidence of the children that there were times that Juliet would be absent – on her errands to Mozambique to traffick others or, simply to visit – and that the children would then be left in the care of her younger sister, Violet, accused no 2. From time to time, when Mabuza wanted to see one of them, he would phone Violet when she would ready them and send them to him (or he would come and fetch them), where they would be raped as before. Sometimes he would give them money that they had to give to accused no 2. During these times, Violet would care for them (harbour them) by giving them food, whilst fully knowing what they were there for and she would ready them and send them to accused no 1 at his request. All of the girls knew all too well they would be left destitute if they did not do as told.The history described by some of the children about accused no 2, Violet, who was also trafficked (by her own elder sister) to South Africa for the sexual pleasure of accused no 1, shows that, when Violet became too old for his attentions, she got a work in the plantation at Rhenosterhoek, and that Juliet then had to go and look for new young blood to come and replace her.One of the things that disturbed the children the most, was that, whenever they reported to Juliet that the accused had injured their private parts during the rapes, and that they bled, she did not respond or help them in any way. To AC she simply said that she would be alright and she would get used to it eventually. To the contrary, when they verbalised their unwillingness to be subjected to rape, or when they subsequently complained and appeared to be unwilling, Juliet threatened them with abandonment in this desolate place, where all of them were strangers. When they requested to be sent back, Juliet always indicated that there was no money. When they enquired about being sent to school, there was no money. To LK she said that she had to sleep with accused no 1 to get money to buy school uniforms. All this while they were related to Juliet, or knew her well enough to view her in a position of authority and trust and who seriously betrayed the trust of the children.One day, JC decided to pack her things and run away from there and, at school, she was found out. The principal and the social worker, Lucia Sonya Khoza were summoned to speak to her. The most that they got out of her was that the other children that she left behind on the farm at Rhenosterhoek was being maltreated and sexually abused. When this was reported to the principal and the social worker, reports were made to the police, which led to Ramodike and others going to the village, where the other children were found. They were in a bad shape, clothes in tatters and dirty, their hair unkempt and in dreadlocks, and they were clearly very hungry.This is where the investigation started. The investigation, before the matter was handed over to Nyathi, was however poorly done. Accused no 1 and Violet were arrested only much later. The particular house in which the incidents reportedly happened was never searched. Accused no 1’s fire arm was only later seized. Etcetera. The children were however put in a place of safety and, eventually, when they properly disclosed what happened statements must have been taken from them, which led to the case being investigated with a view to prosecute and the institution of these proceedings.Accused no 1’s evidenceHe stated that he had worked for York Timbers, until he started his own business rendering contracting services to York Timber at Rhenosterhoek and Blystaan from 2001. Juliet Chauke had worked for his enterprise at Blystaan under a sub-contractor.He stated that the first time ever he saw accused no 2, was during 2011 or 2012, when she started working there as a general labourer. He never had any sexual relationship with accused no 2 or any of the children who testified, whom he did not even know. The first time he ever saw the children that testified, is when they appeared on the TV screen during their testimony. He does not know whether his employees could have family members visit or stay with them in the village, because that was York Timbers’ responsibility. If he wanted to employ more people, he had to ask York Timbers whether his people could use more houses in the village.He cannot deny that the children who testified were staying in that village from 2009 to 2012 as they said they did. He cannot dispute the ages that the children testified they were at the time, nor their reported dates of birth. He however said that he can dispute that the children were ever raped in the main house, because at the relevant time, 2009 to 2011, neither he nor anyone else lived there. He does not know how the children could know of the suite bathroom in the main bedroom to that house. He specifically denied that he ever wore the firearm to work from 2006 until the date of his arrest, and he could therefore not say how the children could have known that he even possesses a firearm. There has never been any bad blood between him and Juliet, or between him and Violet, that could have turned the kids against him. He cannot say whether any of the children could have harboured a motive to falsely implicate him with these serious allegations, but he had overheard that they might have thought that he had a lot of money and that they would get some money if they falsely implicated him. It was pointed out to him that this version of his did not fly, because none of the children, out of their own, laid a charge against him. This case was uncovered by social workers and the police, not by the children. He however insisted that all of them were lying, just to get him into trouble.Accused no 2’s versionAccused no 2 never testified, but her version that was put to the children was that she never had anything to do with their maltreatment, and that she only gave them shelter and food during the absence of Juliet. One or two of the children agreed with this, but others made it clear that, in Juliet’s absence, she pertinently readied them and sent them to accused no 1 at his telephonic requests, and that, at occasion, she received money from accused no 1 via them. These allegations by the children were never denied by her in evidence that could be tested through cross-examination for the veracity thereof.Examination of the victims by a forensic nurse and a medical doctorKok is a forensic nurse and Grabe a medical doctor and professor, who is an expert in dealing with the examination of victims, especially children in sexual assault cases. Kok saw injuries on the private parts of only certain of the girls that she examined, but was quick to add, which was confirmed by Grabe, that the absence of injuries does not necessarily exclude sexual penetration. She was however clearly inexperienced compared to Grabe, who saw more clear indications on the private parts of all the girls she examined that was indicative of sexual penetration of their genitals. This evidence serves to support the four complainants’ versions that they have been sexually penetrated. Of course, these witnesses could not say whether the children had been raped and by whom, although the lesions on their private part were indicative of tears that have healed, which suggested that at least some force had to be used to effect penetration. In her professional opinion based on scientific observations, Grabe, in addition, also put the relevant ages of the girls at the same level than the respective ages that they gave her and the court.",trafficking in persons,1
"Second accused, Lionel Richard Ball, had seen “groups of prostitutes” on the side of the road previously, and asked his domestic worker and co-accused, Nokuzola Ntonga, specifically to fetch V. for him. Evidently, amongst these “groups of prostitutes” stood young girls who were not prostitutes. V. was not a prostitute, and may have been a virgin.Ntonga went to fetch V. from her home, where she resided with her elder sister. V. had known Ntonga prior to the incident. V. was not home, but her sister told Ntonga that V. was at a friend or relative’s house. Ntonga then retrieved V. from the friend or relative’s house. Ntonga told V. and the caretakers of the house that she was taking V. to see a social worker to get shoes and clothes.Rather, Ntonga drove V. to Ball’s home in East London where Ball allegedly raped V. He then allegedly forced her into the shower and locked her in his bedroom when a friend and witness in the case, Raath, visited Ball’s house for a few hours. Raath testified that he did see a young black child, but did not know if she was a girl or what her purpose was of being there. After Raath left, Ball drove V. home. Ball admitted that she was at his home, but claims he only let her watch television, take a shower, and gave her clothes and R200 to purchase shoes.",trafficking in persons,1
"This case involved an urgent application by Mavericks Revue bar, a “gentlemen’s club” in Cape Town, to stop the Department of Home Affairs from terminating its corporate permits, pending a separate judicial review of the withdrawal of the permits. Mavericks Revue bar required the corporate permits in order to legally employ foreign dancers at the establishment.The background to the dispute was that Mavericks had applied to the Department in March 2010 to have 143 out of 200 corporate permits replaced, claiming that they were “lost, mislaid or stolen over many years”. In deciding whether to allow the application the Department learnt Mavericks had not complied with the relevant legislation and the conditions of the corporate worker authorisation certificates. It was claimed by the Department that Mavericks’ corporate workers were not employees but independent contractors who were not paid a wage or salary and that Mavericks’ failed to keep proper records, inform the Department when a worker left, ensure corporate workers complied with provisions of the legislation and ensure foreign workers departed after completion of their tour of duty. On the basis of these reasons, among others, the Department decided to withdraw the corporate permits.",trafficking in persons,0
"SummaryThe three defendants were found guilty on multiple counts relating to running an illegal enterprise which illegally harvested and exported abalones. In March 2019, they were sentenced to 15-18 years imprisonment.Illegal harvesting and trading of abalone have been a reason for concern in South Africa’s Eastern Cape since the 1990s. The seaside city Port Elizabeth is considered a hub for the illegal trade in abalone and has been declared to be a hotspot of criminal enterprises and kingpins. The numbers of abalone, which is mostly sold as delicacy to Asia, has been in decline, sparking the government to respond to the issue by establishing dedicated teams seeding abalone and patrolling the area.Details On 22 March 2015, a member of the South African Police Service observed suspicious activities while being on patrol along the coast heading towards Noordhoek. He observed individuals coming out of the water loading backs onto vehicles. He chased the vehicles and was able to arrest one suspect after a hot pursuit, encountering abalone on the suspect’s car. Another suspect working for the defendants was found in possession of abalone without a permit a month later. The South African Police Service launched an investigation into the operation of the defendants.The lead investigator described the illegal operations of the defendants as syndicate-like. While their enterprise relied on the support of several people, the defendants conducted their operations on a need-to-know basis, in which different participants in the supply chain would have limited knowledge about the overall operation. Abalones are being harvested by divers using diving equipment provided for by the accused. The harvested abalones would be packed and marked with an identification mark of the respective harvester. From there, the abalones would be loaded onto motor vehicles, from where a driver would take them to the “weight house”. In that station, the abalones would be sorted by size, had their shell removed and weighted. Based on their weight, the divers would be paid. Another driver would then take the abalones to another location where they would be stored in freezers. Yet another person would later pick them up to transport them to the processing plant, where the abalones get cleaned and cooked. Via the cities of Gauteng or Cape Town, the abalones would ultimately be shipped to China and sold as delicacy.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"In January 2009, Peter Michael Roberts (accused 1) and six co-accused were arrested by the erstwhile Directorate of Special Operations (the Scorpions) following a police operation codenamed Operation May. The enterprise traded and distributed approximately 30 tons of shucked abalone over a period of 40 months. The State argued that Peter Roberts was the mastermind and that his co-accused were central to the enterprise.Two of the accused, who were arrested five kilometres from the Lebombo border post between South Africa and Mozambique, are not subject to this trial since both pleaded guilty and entered a plea bargain with the State. Both were convicted and sentenced but not incarcerated. The remaining five accused all denied complicity in the offences, which included conducting an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activities (2005 – 2009), in the illicit trade in and transportation of abalone – in a truck with a concealed roof – to Mozambique.The State demonstrated that Peter Roberts was indeed central to the enterprise by relying on witness testimony, documentary evidence obtained through a seizure operation, and transcripts from intercepted phone calls to and from Roberts. It was found that their operation possessed, transported, and exported abalone from the Eastern Cape to Mozambique. The illegal trade in abalone was the predicate offence to the more serious crime of racketeering, that carries a heavier sentence, which necessitated the State to demonstrate the existence of an enterprise with a pattern of more than two incidents and show the involvement of the accused in the enterprise. The racketeering pattern was established by triangulating the abovementioned evidence to cases in which s204 witnesses (see commentary) testified about the complicity of the accused in similar cases in which the witnesses were duly convicted and sentenced.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"3 individuals were charged in the criminal trial for manufacturing methamphetamine in contravention of the Drugs Act. The main accused S.P. was accused of operating a drug manufacturing laboratory from his residence. He owned the property. The State also brought civil forfeiture proceedings against the property which S.P., as the owner of the property, opposed.S.P. was criminally charged with contraventions of the Drugs Act. He was found manufacturing methamphetamine in a laboratory in his home. He was however acquitted of these charges on the basis of technical problems with a search and seizure warrant that led to the discovery of the laboratory. The State also brought civil asset forfeiture proceedings against the property on the basis that the property was used to manufacture drugs. This application was successful, notwithstanding several appeals, including an appeal to the Constitutional Court by S.P.The criminal proceedings and asset forfeiture proceedings were instituted simultaneously. S.P. brought an application to stay the civil forfeiture proceedings pending the finalization of his criminal case. He contended that the civil proceedings would violate his right to remain silent. This application was dismissed and forfeiture granted as the court found that the decision to oppose forfeiture of his property did not amount to a compulsion to speak in violation of his right to remain silent. S.P. had a choice to defend the forfeiture application or he could remain silent. The court held that it was not required to protect him from the consequences of exercising this difficult choice. The court ordered that the property be forfeited to the State on the basis that it was used to manufacture drugs in contravention of the Drugs Act.After his acquittal in the criminal case S.P. argued that the forfeiture was unfair as the criminal court had acquitted him of the charges. His property could therefore not be forfeited as the criminal court had not been satisfied that the crimes he was accused of were in fact committed. The appeal court found that the state had proved on a civil standard that the property was used to manufacture methamphetamine and the findings of the criminal court were irrelevant to the forfeiture proceedings.S.P. then appealed to the Constitutional Court asking the court to declare the forfeiture order an unfair violation of his fair trial rights (to remain silent, not to incriminate himself) and his right to property. He also ask the court to find that the lower court should have granted him a stay of the civil forfeiture proceedings pending. He was unsuccessful in his constitutional challenge and the property was forfeited to the State.",drug offences,0
"This case mainly concerns the conduct of alleged human trafficking and facilitation to such crimes which was prosecuted by the High Court in Pretoria, South Africa. During the period 1 April 2016 up to September 2016, defendant 3, namely C.J. Obasi, harboured at least two victims at Jaspit Court with the alleged intent to exploit his victims sexually. Both of the victims who testified as witnesses before the Court were first brought to contact with the said defendant by their acquaintances. Prior to arriving at Jaspit Court, the victims had been living in vulnerable conditions resulting from irregular immigrant status, addiction to drugs, as well as complicated family issues. And such conditions were later taken advantage of by the traffickers to gain control over the victims. Although victims seemlingly came to Jaspit Court out of their free will, they were subsequently controlled with drugs, threatened by force, and repeatedly assaulted by the said defendant. The victims worked as prostitutes during such period of time but were forced to hand over all the incomes they had made. They also had to entertain “smoking clients”, visitors who come to consume drugs. It was also reported that the victims were pushed to have sexual intercourse with Obasi due to the hierarchical relationship between them. At the same time, the victim enjoyed little personal freedom: they were not allowed to go anywhere on their own during daytime, and later following a failed attempt to escape, they were not allowed to leave the flat at all during daytime.  While defendant 3, Obasi, carried out the major activities, defendant 1, namely Abba, was trained and served to run the “business” in the exact same manner during Obasi’s temporary absence. Defendant 2, Mkhonto, who had once been romantically involved with Obasi, leased to him the property in which the victims were harboured. However, she was not directly involved, nor had she ever met the victims in the entire process.",drug offences,0

"From 2010 to 2014, the defendant Mr Z. conducted a criminal enterprise to fraudulently purchase goods on commercial websites. To this end, Mr Z. used stolen credit card data found on carding forums by himself, Mr P. (the technical advisor of the group) and Mr N. (a member of the group in charge of finding credit card data), as well as credit card data that Mr L. had stolen from his former employer. Mr P. and Mr Z. would then hack into customer accounts on commercial websites and modify their contact information so that the actual customer would not receive any notification of purchase and/or delivery. Mr Z. and N. would then buy goods on commercial websites and send them to parcel collection points. Mr Z and Mr X forged fake IDs and used mules to receive the packages at the collection points. Several people were used as mules: Messrs Y, M, O, Q, V, T, and R. The mules would receive the packages, keep some packages as payment and send the others to Mr Z. so that he could sell them on retailer websites. Several people involved in this criminal organization later started using the same techniques to buy goods on their own behalf.The group managed to place around 2000 orders on shopping websites for an amount estimated to be between EUR 40 000 and 60 000.When they were arrested, Mr Z. and Mr V. were also found in possession of ATM skimmers that they had intended to use to launch an operation to get more credit card data.",cybercrime,1

"Subject of the case are legal proceedings initiated by Cédric H. and his colleagues to challenge the constitutionality of Articles L.622-1 and L 622-4 of the French Code on the Entry and Residence of Foreign Nationals and the Right to Asylum. The applicants claimed that the offence of facilitating the illegal entry, movement and residence of a foreign person infringed upon the principle of fraternity, as it did not sufficiently take into account humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants without material or financial compensation.The French Constitutional court, first of all, clarified that the principle of fraternity enjoyed constitutional value as it is enshrined in Art. 2 and 72-3 of the Constitution and, secondly, that it comprised the freedom to help one another without consideration as to whether the assisted person is legally residing within the French territory. On the other hand, the principle of fraternity must be balanced against the legislature’s responsibility to safeguard public order.  Applied to the legislation at hand, the Court found that criminalizing any assistance to irregular migrants, including when it is given for humanitarian reasons, did not strike a fair balance between the afore-mentioned principles and violated the constitutional provisions on fraternity. The Court, however, dismissed arguments based on the necessity and proportionality principles, legal certainty principle, protection of human dignity, and equality before the law which it considered not to be infringed upon by the legislation in question.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The plaintiff, a woman of unknown age, established that she had been recruited and subjected to accommodation and work conditions contrary to human dignity by the two Respondents, a married couple for whom she worked, for their material benefit. The Plaintiff states that the Second Respondent had approached her with the promise that, if she came to work in France with the brother of the Second Respondent, she would receive a salary and would be able to follow literacy courses. The plaintiff was thus subjected to accommodation and working conditions which were contrary to her human dignity, as well as forced domestic servitude at the hands of – and for the benefit of - Respondents 1 and 2 over the period of October 2005 to November 2007. As found by the Court of Appeal of Versailles, Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code criminalising the trafficking in persons was modified by the Law 2007/1631 of November 20, 2007, changing the text of the Article from:         ‘Trafficking in persons is comprised of the recruitment, transportation, harbouring and reception of any person, for financial or other material benefit, to make said personavailable to a third party, even where said third party is not identified, in order to allow the commission of breaches of working or accommodation conditions against the person contrary to their human dignity.’To        ‘Trafficking in persons is the recruitment, transportation, harbouring or welcoming a person, for financial or other non-financial material benefit, in order to make them available to themselves or at the disposal of a third party, being identified or not, to enable to commission against the person of offences against the person resulting from their being subjected to working or accommodation conditions which are contrary to their human dignity.’ As such in the present case, from the period of the October 2005 to September 2008, the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in degrading conditions by the Respondents for their own benefit. Thus, as the Plaintiff had not been put at the disposal of a third party, from the period from October 2005 to November 2007 the Respondents could not be charged with trafficking in persons pursuant to the unamended text of Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code. Rather, the respondents are liable for having committed the lesser offence of subjecting a person to accommodation and work conditions contrary to their human dignity pursuant to Article 225-14 of the Penal Code. The Court of Cassation, held however, that on the facts the respondent had been put at the disposal of a third party. This notwithstanding, from 20 November, 2007 to 21 September, 2008, the Respondents could be prosecuted for having committed trafficking in persons for the period over which the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in conditions contrary to their human dignity for the benefit of the Respondents following the entry into force of the Law 2007/1631 of the 20 November 2007.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The defendant was accused of facilitating the illegal transit and stay of three Eritrean female migrants (including a minor), who he knew were in France irregularly. The facts occurred on 18 October 2016, between Tende (France) and Nice (France), via La Turbie (Alpes Maritimes, France). The defendant provided transportation and accommodation in his residence to the three irregular migrants.On the afore-mentioned date, the police carried out a traffic control operation in highway A8, close to la Turbie, between 01.00 and 07.00. The defendant was ordered to pull over at approximately 04.45. Authorities realised the defendant was transporting three women, who attempted to hide their faces.The defendant was placed under custody. The search of the vehicle did not reveal anything pertinent to investigations. Later, authorities searched the residence of the defendant, where they found three matrasses placed on the floor and, in the kitchen, nine glasses and bowls as well as a pot with food.Two of the migrants were heard by authorities. One, declared to have fled Eritrea, via the Sahara desert. She went to Sudan and, then, Libya. From there, she left to Italy, by sea, with the assistance of migrant smugglers to whom she paid 3600 USD. She wouldbe attempting to arrive to Germany, where relatives of her resided. She stated to have encountered the defendant by chance, while she and her compatriots where walking towards France. The defendant would have stopped and, realising their tiredness, invited them into the vehicle, without charging them any fees or requesting any advantage in return.The other migrant confirmed the statement of her compatriot. She declared to have paid 3500 USD to be smuggled from Libya into Italy. She would have attempted before to walk towards Germany, in the company of her cousin. However, the latter would have been ran over by a truck and died. On her second attempt, she walked for several days, through the mountains, with her two compatriots. They would be in the process of walking when a vehicle stopped close to them. They asked the driver for help. The defendant accepted to give them a ride without asking any payment or benefit in return.The defendant, in turn, contested the version given by the migrants.  According to him, he had taken charge of the three women in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende (France), upon finding them in an abandoned building close to associations that aimed to provide humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants. He further explained to usually associate with members of such associations/organisations, particularly those intending to supply food and accommodation to migrants in need. He admitted to have witnessed several conversations without ever directly providing humanitarian assistance himself. However, two days before, while he was going to La Brigue to attend a popular celebration with his 12-year old daughter, he notice four young individuals, appearing to be African, and in inappropriate attire in view of the current season. He decided to stop, namely to sensitise his daughter to the difficulties endured by irregular migrants. He ended up conversing with the four young individuals (allegedly from Darfur), who declared to wish to travel to the coast. However, they were heading to the mountains. The defendant agreed to return at approximately 18.00 and help them. He did as agreed. He took the young men to his residence and gave them food and accommodation for the night. The next day, he gave them a ride to the station of Arcs (France) and paid them a train ticket to the station of Carnoules (France). Following these events, he went to work. At the end of the day, he joined some friends in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende (France). One of his friends informed him that a number of associations providing humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants intended to invest on a squat in order to ensure accommodation to those in need. This friend would have told the defendant that he would be helping in this endeavour. The defendant decided to accompany his friend to the site at approximately 01.00. After a while, given the late hour, the defendant manifested his intent to return home. One of the individuals on site, proposed that he took the three Eritrean women to his house and, the following day, gave them a ride to the station of Cagnes-Sur-Mer (France). There, they would take the train to Marseille (France) where they would be expected by doctors and other humanitarian workers. With some hesitation, the defendant accepted. He declared to be fully aware of the irregular situation of the women in France. Yet, he acted out of solidarity in view of their dramatic circumstances. He described that, when he met the women, they were tired, fearful and ‘frozen’. They presented apparent wounds and bandages. One of the three Eritrean women was again questioned, this time confirming the version of events reported by the defendant. The latter’s declarations were also corroborated by the analysis of his phone records. On the one hand, many of the defendant’s contacts were indeed individuals well known for their humanitarian work/involvement. On the other hand, a number of messages were illustrative of the defendant’s intent to help migrants in need, in the sense explained by him during questioning. They further supported the facts reported by the defendant. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence as well as the outcome of search and seizure operations. Expert evidence was also considered. Notably, a physician working with Médecins du Monde attested to the debilitating health conditions of the three Eritrean migrants: (i) they presented contusions, wounds, and sprains due to long hours walking; (ii) most concerning, their psychological state was particularly worrying. The expert further noted to be familiar with the squat in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende, declaring it to be impossible to deny help, food, clothing and accommodation to the migrants settling therein. In addition, the Defence submitted an affidavit from President of the Ligue des droits de l’Homme(who was not heard in court due to time constrains), according to which the actions of the defendant were defined as “gestures of humanity and solidarity towards human beings in situation of total precariousness”. Legal findings:In responding to the humanitarian justification invoked by the Defence, the Public Prosecutor underlined the difference between ‘rescue’ and ‘aide’. The former implies an immediate danger and it is, hence, a duty. The actions of the defendant were to be integrated, instead, within a more organised help/assistance, which was not connected to a real and imminent danger to the life or safety of others. It thus maintained its argument for the conviction of the defendant for facilitation of illegal transit and stay of irregular migrants in France.The Tribunal de Grande Instance of Nice acquitted the defendant.For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1

"The judgment decides the appeal presented by two individuals (H.F. and M.H.) against their conviction for inter alia migrant smuggling, specifically for procuring and or enabling - in the context of an organised criminal group - the illegal entry, transit and or stay of non EU citizens, in contradiction to EU and domestic law on the matter. On 28 July 2012, after being alerted by the Town Hall of Lunéville (France), the border police – Police Aux Frontières (PAF) – questioned H.F. and another individual. They had tried to acquire a French identity card to the latter by presenting a false certificate of French nationality, copy of fraudulent birth certificate, certificate of loss of identity card as issued by the police, copy of certificate of residence (in an address later determined to be fictitious). The investigations that followed permitted to ascertained as follows:H.F. participated in at least nine similar operations aimed at fraudulently obtaining French identity cards to foreigners. He chose the most appropriate municipalities to carry out the plan. He arranged the logistics and accompanied the foreigners to the police (where they declared to have lost the national identity card so as to gather a corresponding certificate to deliver in the Town Hall), assisting them to collect fraudulent certificates of residence issued by defendant M.H. or an insurance company. H.F. also assisted the foreigner in his or her endeavour in the Town Hall aimed at acquiring national documents in a fraudulent manner. Migrant smuggling activities were carried out in Thiais (France).M.H. participated in at least four operations, in the context of which he supplied falsified certificates of residence. In some instances, he also accompanied the migrants to the Town Hall to assist them in the attempt of acquiring national identity documents. Migrant smuggling activities were carried out in Aubervilliers (France). From the residence of H.F., authorities seized, among other items, a file for the request of a French passport, a certificate of loss of identity card, three replies to requests of birth certificates, 29 extracts of birth certificates, five certificates of French nationality issued to different persons, eight ink-stamps (corresponding to different municipalities) with the writing “certified”. From the residence of M.H., authorities seized inter alia dozens of blank templates of: (i) water invoices, (ii) birth certificates from three municipalities, (iii) blank sheets of paper with the ink-stamp of Town Hall. The appellants acknowledged their participation in the activities above described. In determining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on (i) statements of witnesses and defendants, (ii) interception of communications, (iii) surveillance, searches and seizures. Legal findings:The Court of Nancy(France)convicted the defendant inter alia for migrant smuggling, specifically for procuring and or enabling - in the context of an organised criminal group - the illegal entry, transit and or stay of non EU citizens, in contradiction to EU and domestic law The Appeal Court of Nancy confirmed the decision.

"The appellant O.X. used his professional position in the préfecture of Guyane (France)  - where he dealt with requests for residence permits – to facilitate the fraudulent issuing of administrative documents necessary for foreigners to enter and stay in France. While O.X. did not have the power to decide on requests for residence permit, he manipulated and presented the files to his hierarchy fully aware of mis-representations therein. He acted in this manner for financial or other material gain. A review of his bank accounts revealed abnormal and unjustified operations, notably: 32 500 Euro in May 2007 and 43 700 in April 2007. The appellant tried to justify this income with his gambling endeavours. However, several inconsistencies in that respect remained. Upon searching his residence, authorities discovered several blank certificates of accommodation, a crucial document in the process of requesting a residence permit. Appellant O.X. denied all accusations though admitting to have changed the planning of work and accelerated the schedule of meetings, yet without receiving any gain in exchange.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on searches and seizures, documental and testimonial evidence.  Legal findings:The Court of Appeal of Cayennes (France)convicted the appellants of passive corruption and “assisting the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France”. On appeal, the Court of Cassation partially confirmed the decision. However, it overturned it in respect of the penalty applied.For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The defendant admitted to have issued certificates of residence in France to several irregular migrants, allegedly without having perceived any financial or other material benefit. He acknowledged to have the same stated “legal residence” as an irregular migrant he assisted but was, nonetheless, unable to provide any information regarding the latter.Upon a search to the defendant’s residence, authorities found his associate (M.Y.) as well as seven irregular migrants in situ. The electricity contract of the apartment was under the defendant’s name. During questioning, M.Y. was unable to explain the provenance of 6000 Euro found in his possession, simply stating the cash had been lent to him by friends so as to enable the purchase of a real estate. In ascertaining the facts, authorities took into account inter alia testimonial evidence and the outcome search and seizure operations. Legal findings:The competent Investigative Judge deemed there to be sufficient evidence to hold the defendant and his associate prima facie responsible for “assisting the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France”. Accordingly, it referred the case to the tribunal correctionnel. The defendant contested this decision.

"Throughout 2008, 2009 and 2010, in French territory, the defendants (W.A.T. and B.E.F.) assisted foreign nationals (at least 13) to irregularly enter, transit or stay in France, notably by: (i) falsifying and using false administrative documents, (ii) being in possession of false administrative documents, (iii) obtaining false documents. The offences were committed through an organised criminal group.  On 6 July 2009, the Sub-Directorate on the Fight against Irregular Migration and the Illegal Work of Foreigners (Sous-direction de la Lutte de l’immigration irrégulière et le travail illégale des étrangers) received an anonymous tip on the existence of a network of irregular migration. Defendant W.A.T. would be involved in it by ensuring the trip and arrival in France of migrants original from Mauritania, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Morocco, some of whom would be minors. As a result, authorities placed the residence of W.A.T. and himself under surveillance. On 9 July 2012, he was observed picking up two seemingly African individuals from the station of Austerlitz (Paris, France), who were arriving from Cerbère (France). The analysis of the data collected through the bugging of his mobile phones, revealed that (i) W.A.T. was often in contact with Morocco, (ii) migrants paid between 2500 and 3000 Euro per person. W.A.T.’s phone number often activated towers in airports Rossy Charles de Gaule and d’Orly (both in France). In August 2009, W.A.T. carried out several return trips between Spain and Morocco.The analysis of his computer data (which had also been bugged), provided evidence on the organisation of trips, recruitment of migrants, and methods used to obtain false documents. Authorities retrieved photographs in passport format, copies of passports, plane tickets reservations. In several emails, W.A.T. acknowledged and confirmed the arrival of several migrants in France, sometimes via Morocco.Electronic surveillance techniques permitted identifying several accomplices/members of the organised criminal group operating: (i) in France (five individual including the defendant B.E.F.) and abroad (four individuals, residing in the United Kingdom and Morocco).From December 2009 on, W.A.T. extended his migrant smuggling activities to Greece’s route. In this context, another accomplice, resident in Belgium, was identified. Physical and electronic surveillance confirmed these developments and attested to the arrival of at least two irregular migrants, via Greece. Conversations involving W.A.T. and his accomplices referred to “app. 20 migrants in Greece waiting for their trip to France”.Under questioning, W.A.T. declared inter alia that new arrivals in Morocco would receive a three months valid stamp on their passport. W.A.T. thus proposed to migrants the stamping of their passports in the terms explained, in exchange of 800 Euro. He declared to authorities that he would receive the payment and disappear before concluding any border crossing. Investigations revealed close connections with a police officer in Morocco. W.A.T. also admitted some involvement in the migrant smuggling venture via Greece. He denied additional criminal facts. B.E.F. was heard on the facts. He declared to be a child friend of W.A.T. He denied being involved in smuggling ventures, though W.A.T. would “have something to do with it”. B.E.F. admitted to facts attested by surveillance techniques, notably having supplied stolen passports and third parties’ passports to W.A.T. He later retracted some of these admissions. His involvement in the activities of the organised criminal group was supported by the declarations of other members thereof. In ascertaining the facts, authorities resorted to electronic surveillance (including interception of communications, computer bugging), searches and seizures, physical surveillance operations, declarations of defendants and witnesses. Legal findings:The defendants were charged by the Prosecution with  “assisting, though an organised criminal group, the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State Party to the Schengen Agreement”.

"The judgment decides the appeal presented by an individual (D.T.P.) against his conviction for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The appellant was charged with arranging “approximately 30 marriages” with the purpose of obtaining or facilitating the issuance of residence permits in France or the acquisition of French nationality, during the period of 1 January 2002 to 31 January 2007. However, the accusation and appealed sentence refer in detail to 10 marriages from 21 August 2002 to 4 May 2004.The recruitment of French nationals to marry Cameroonian citizens took place in France while the marriages were celebrated in Denmark since the latter’s legislation did not require the presence of the spouses earlier than the day before the wedding.  The recruited brides were paid between 2000 and 4500 Euro. The marriages were organised via the intermediation of an enterprise based in Germany, which, in 2002-2004, perceived a significant increase of marriages between French and Cameroonians. The enterprise charged a fee of 350 Euro per wedding. Its owners declared that the appellant referred to them 1-2 couples per month, for which he received a fee of 50 Euro per marriage.It was ascertained this scheme operated through a number of intermediaries, who recruited the French nationals and transported them to Denmark, to celebrate the wedding, and then back to France. Sometimes they went to Germany to address organisational issues. Their expenses in the course of these events were covered. The appellant was identified as “le Président” of this organisational scheme. Some witnesses indicated the appellant was present in preparatory meetings of the fraudulent marriages and directly engaged in the arrangement thereof. The wife of the appellant declared to have recruited six women on behalf of the defendant to marry African individuals based in Europe. She estimated her husband organised two to five marriages per month (108 to 270 marriages from August 2002 to December 2006). The appellant himself declared to organise such marriages – “approximately 30 from 2002 on – demanding 4000 Euro to the African spouse-to-be. From this amount, 3000 Euro would be for the woman to marry, 500 Euro for the recruiter and 500 Euro for himself. He also acknowledged to have acted as intermediary to the Germany-based enterprise specialised in planning weddings. He continued these activities until the moment of his detention. In determining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on statements of witnesses, individuals who contracted sham marriages, intermediaries in the criminal plan, the defendant. Telephone surveillance techniques were also used. Legal findings:The Court of Rennes(France)convicted the defendant for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The Appeal Court of Rennes overturned the decision and ordered the release of the defendant. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The decision rules on the appeal lodged by two individuals against their conviction inter alia for “assisting in the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner original from other State party to the Schengen Agreement”. The appellants were deemed members of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. Between 2009 and 26 April 2011, the appellants assisted foreigners to irregularly obtain a residence permit in Spain, by presenting false marriage certificates. They recruited French women willing to go through with the scam, accompanied the Tunisian migrants to Spain, and obtained the necessary fraudulent documents.The “wife” firstly enrolled in the registry of foreigners in Spain. The “husband” would later address the same services and request, on the basis of a false marriage certificate, the issuance of a Spanish residence permit. Legal findings:La Juridiction inter-régionale spécialisée de Bordeauxconvicted the defendants of “assisting in the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State party to the Schengen Agreement”. The Court of Appeal of Bordeaux confirmed the appealed decision but increased the length of the penalty of interdiction from the French territory.For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The defendant – a priest – provided accommodation to irregular migrants in the Parish Centre of Montreynaud (France), property of the diocesan association, the president of which was the Bishop of Saint Etienne (France).He was accused of having breached the municipal regulation of 4 February 2013 that determined the closure of the establishment in question. It was argued against the defendant that the Parish Centre did not fully comply with regulations on public safety and sanitation. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, including from the defendant. Legal findings:The Prosecution demanded a fine of 12 000 Euro. It was argued that the “accommodation policy” favoured by the defendant was an incentive to irregular migration. The Court of First Instance of Saint Étienne acquitted the defendant. For further details see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”. Note: The case against the defendant was not pursued on grounds of migrant smuggling.

"Date(s) of offending: On/from throughout 2011 to 22 November 2011In February 2011, the German police informed OCRIEST (Office central pour la répression de l'immigration irrégulière et de l'emploi d' étrangers sans titre) of the existence of a Vietnamese organized criminal group primordially based and managed in France dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. The defendants were accused of membership in the said organized criminal group, the function of which was to ensure the illegal entry of migrants into the United Kingdom, either via transportation arranged by the criminal network or through the so-called “éco”, “Co”, or“Herbe” method, that is, hiding in lorries without the knowledge of the drivers.Specifically, throughout 2011 and until 22 November of the same year, the defendants operated in the regions of Île de France (France) and Nord Pas de Calais (France). They inter alia (i) procured the entry of migrants in France by purchasing bus, plane and train tickets, fraudulently obtaining visas, arranging for vehicles with drivers; (ii) provided accommodation and food to irregular migrants while awaiting for departure to the United Kingdom; (iii) transported migrants throughout the country as necessary; (iv) helped migrants jumping into lorries heading to the United Kingdom; (v) acted as passeurs.The organized criminal group facilitated irregular migration mostly of Chinese and Vietnamese individuals. As noted earlier, the main goal was to ensure their illegal entry into the United Kingdom. The smuggling venture often implicated passing through Romania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, and or Belgium before reaching France. Migrants left Vietnam by plane and entered Europe mostly via Czech Republic. They followed to France by train (300 Euro) or bus (100 Euro). Once in France, the migrants were received by members of the organized criminal group that arranged for their stay until the moment of departure. In respect of departures via “Co” method, it usually occurred via Calais. Migrants were kept in camps, monitored by smugglers. Conditions in such sites were difficult. Smugglers took from migrants their documentation and mobile phones.Specifically concerning the procurement of documents necessary to enter the European Union, the criminal group used valid documents of Vietnamese with physical resemblance to the migrants in question. To such documents were added visas fraudulently obtained through fictitious invitation letters issued by companies in Eastern Europe (mostly Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania). These visas “cost” 11000 Euro. The organized criminal group sold them to migrants at 13000 Euro. Once in the European Union, irregular migrants were to get rid of their own identity documents and keep only the fraudulent ones. Following June 2011, this modus operandi faced obstacles since embassies in Europe became reluctant to easily issue visas to Chinese nationals.The overall prices of the smuggling venture varied: between 18500 Euro and 20000 Euro – Vietnam to United Kingdom; 14000 Euro – Vietnam to France; between 13000 Euro and 15000 Euro – Vietnam to Czech Republic; 7000 – Czech Republic to France. Sometimes the payment was required before beginning the travel. Other times, migrants were allowed to pay part of the price once in Europe. On occasion, the payment of a deposit was demanded. As for the transfer of funds, migrants usually delivered the payment to small businesses in Vietnam (usually jewelry shops), which wired the money to assigned contacts in Europe.Defendant 9 was deemed the leader of the organized criminal group. Defendants 2 and 4 were his men of trust. The other defendants were intermediaries and middle-men, the functions of whom varied between recruiting irregular migrants in Vietnam, arranging for fraudulent documentation, accommodating migrants, collecting travel “prices”, transporting migrants, etc.Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 did not possess valid documents to enter and stay in France. They were thus accused of illegal entry and stay.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, especially from the irregular migrants and defendants. An interpreter appointed by the court assisted several of them. The defendants essentially denied the accusations held against them or recognized some minor participation therein. This notwithstanding, electronic and physical surveillance as well as searches were crucial in confirming the facts as exposed above.Legal findingsAll defendants were convicted of migrants smuggling in the context of an organised criminal group. Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 were acquitted of illegal entry and stay in national territory. For further details see  “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,0

"The plaintiff, a woman of unknown age, established that she had been recruited and subjected to accommodation and work conditions contrary to human dignity by the two Respondents, a married couple for whom she worked, for their material benefit. The Plaintiff states that the Second Respondent had approached her with the promise that, if she came to work in France with the brother of the Second Respondent, she would receive a salary and would be able to follow literacy courses. The plaintiff was thus subjected to accommodation and working conditions which were contrary to her human dignity, as well as forced domestic servitude at the hands of – and for the benefit of - Respondents 1 and 2 over the period of October 2005 to November 2007. As found by the Court of Appeal of Versailles, Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code criminalising the trafficking in persons was modified by the Law 2007/1631 of November 20, 2007, changing the text of the Article from:         ‘Trafficking in persons is comprised of the recruitment, transportation, harbouring and reception of any person, for financial or other material benefit, to make said personavailable to a third party, even where said third party is not identified, in order to allow the commission of breaches of working or accommodation conditions against the person contrary to their human dignity.’To        ‘Trafficking in persons is the recruitment, transportation, harbouring or welcoming a person, for financial or other non-financial material benefit, in order to make them available to themselves or at the disposal of a third party, being identified or not, to enable to commission against the person of offences against the person resulting from their being subjected to working or accommodation conditions which are contrary to their human dignity.’ As such in the present case, from the period of the October 2005 to September 2008, the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in degrading conditions by the Respondents for their own benefit. Thus, as the Plaintiff had not been put at the disposal of a third party, from the period from October 2005 to November 2007 the Respondents could not be charged with trafficking in persons pursuant to the unamended text of Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code. Rather, the respondents are liable for having committed the lesser offence of subjecting a person to accommodation and work conditions contrary to their human dignity pursuant to Article 225-14 of the Penal Code. The Court of Cassation, held however, that on the facts the respondent had been put at the disposal of a third party. This notwithstanding, from 20 November, 2007 to 21 September, 2008, the Respondents could be prosecuted for having committed trafficking in persons for the period over which the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in conditions contrary to their human dignity for the benefit of the Respondents following the entry into force of the Law 2007/1631 of the 20 November 2007.",trafficking in persons,1

Y. worked for the couple of defendants for 150 Euro per month, which A. automatically transferred to Y’s aunt in Senegal. Y. never perceived any remuneration for her work. The defendants did not make the necessary declarations to social security. Y. slept and ate at the defendants residence.

Conversations involving W.A.T. and his accomplices referred to “app. 20 migrants in Greece waiting for their trip to France”.Under questioning, W.A.T. declared inter alia that new arrivals in Morocco would receive a three months valid stamp on their passport. W.A.T. thus proposed to migrants the stamping of their passports in the terms explained, in exchange of 800 Euro. He declared to authorities that he would receive the payment and disappear before concluding any border crossing. Investigations revealed close connections with a police officer in Morocco. W.A.T. also admitted some involvement in the migrant smuggling venture via Greece. He denied additional criminal facts. B.E.F. was heard on the facts. He declared to be a child friend of W.A.T. He denied being involved in smuggling ventures, though W.A.T. would “have something to do with it”. B.E.F. admitted to facts attested by surveillance techniques, notably having supplied stolen passports and third parties’ passports to W.A.T. He later retracted some of these admissions. His involvement in the activities of the organised criminal group was supported by the declarations of other members thereof. In ascertaining the facts, authorities resorted to electronic surveillance (including interception of communications, computer bugging), searches and seizures, physical surveillance operations, declarations of defendants and witnesses. Legal findings:The defendants were charged by the Prosecution with  “assisting, though an organised criminal group, the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State Party to the Schengen Agreement”. The Court convicted the defendants. B.E.F. was acquitted for events prior to 31 August 2009.For further details see “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The judgment decides the appeal presented by an individual (D.T.P.) against his conviction for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The appellant was charged with arranging “approximately 30 marriages” with the purpose of obtaining or facilitating the issuance of residence permits in France or the acquisition of French nationality, during the period of 1 January 2002 to 31 January 2007. However, the accusation and appealed sentence refer in detail to 10 marriages from 21 August 2002 to 4 May 2004.The recruitment of French nationals to marry Cameroonian citizens took place in France while the marriages were celebrated in Denmark since the latter’s legislation did not require the presence of the spouses earlier than the day before the wedding.  The recruited brides were paid between 2000 and 4500 Euro. The marriages were organised via the intermediation of an enterprise based in Germany, which, in 2002-2004, perceived a significant increase of marriages between French and Cameroonians. The enterprise charged a fee of 350 Euro per wedding. Its owners declared that the appellant referred to them 1-2 couples per month, for which he received a fee of 50 Euro per marriage.It was ascertained this scheme operated through a number of intermediaries, who recruited the French nationals and transported them to Denmark, to celebrate the wedding, and then back to France. Sometimes they went to Germany to address organisational issues. Their expenses in the course of these events were covered. The appellant was identified as “le Président” of this organisational scheme. Some witnesses indicated the appellant was present in preparatory meetings of the fraudulent marriages and directly engaged in the arrangement thereof. The wife of the appellant declared to have recruited six women on behalf of the defendant to marry African individuals based in Europe. She estimated her husband organised two to five marriages per month (108 to 270 marriages from August 2002 to December 2006). The appellant himself declared to organise such marriages – “approximately 30 from 2002 on – demanding 4000 Euro to the African spouse-to-be. From this amount, 3000 Euro would be for the woman to marry, 500 Euro for the recruiter and 500 Euro for himself. He also acknowledged to have acted as intermediary to the Germany-based enterprise specialised in planning weddings. He continued these activities until the moment of his detention. In determining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on statements of witnesses, individuals who contracted sham marriages, intermediaries in the criminal plan, the defendant. Telephone surveillance techniques were also used. Legal findings:The Court of Rennes(France)convicted the defendant for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The Appeal Court of Rennes overturned the decision and ordered the release of the defendant. For further details see “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The decision rules on the appeal lodged by two individuals against their conviction inter alia for “assisting in the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner original from other State party to the Schengen Agreement”. The appellants were deemed members of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. Between 2009 and 26 April 2011, the appellants assisted foreigners to irregularly obtain a residence permit in Spain, by presenting false marriage certificates. They recruited French women willing to go through with the scam, accompanied the Tunisian migrants to Spain, and obtained the necessary fraudulent documents.The “wife” firstly enrolled in the registry of foreigners in Spain. The “husband” would later address the same services and request, on the basis of a false marriage certificate, the issuance of a Spanish residence permit. Legal findings:La Juridiction inter-régionale spécialisée de Bordeauxconvicted the defendants of “assisting in the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State party to the Schengen Agreement”. The Court of Appeal of Bordeaux confirmed the appealed decision but increased the length of the penalty of interdiction from the French territory.For further details see “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"Date(s) of offending: On/from throughout 2011 to 22 November 2011In February 2011, the German police informed OCRIEST (Office central pour la répression de l'immigration irrégulière et de l'emploi d' étrangers sans titre) of the existence of a Vietnamese organized criminal group primordially based and managed in France dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. The defendants were accused of membership in the said organized criminal group, the function of which was to ensure the illegal entry of migrants into the United Kingdom, either via transportation arranged by the criminal network or through the so-called “éco”, “Co”, or“Herbe” method, that is, hiding in lorries without the knowledge of the drivers.Specifically, throughout 2011 and until 22 November of the same year, the defendants operated in the regions of Île de France (France) and Nord Pas de Calais (France). They inter alia (i) procured the entry of migrants in France by purchasing bus, plane and train tickets, fraudulently obtaining visas, arranging for vehicles with drivers; (ii) provided accommodation and food to irregular migrants while awaiting for departure to the United Kingdom; (iii) transported migrants throughout the country as necessary; (iv) helped migrants jumping into lorries heading to the United Kingdom; (v) acted as passeurs.The organized criminal group facilitated irregular migration mostly of Chinese and Vietnamese individuals. As noted earlier, the main goal was to ensure their illegal entry into the United Kingdom. The smuggling venture often implicated passing through Romania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, and or Belgium before reaching France. Migrants left Vietnam by plane and entered Europe mostly via Czech Republic. They followed to France by train (300 Euro) or bus (100 Euro). Once in France, the migrants were received by members of the organized criminal group that arranged for their stay until the moment of departure. In respect of departures via “Co” method, it usually occurred via Calais. Migrants were kept in camps, monitored by smugglers. Conditions in such sites were difficult. Smugglers took from migrants their documentation and mobile phones.Specifically concerning the procurement of documents necessary to enter the European Union, the criminal group used valid documents of Vietnamese with physical resemblance to the migrants in question. To such documents were added visas fraudulently obtained through fictitious invitation letters issued by companies in Eastern Europe (mostly Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania). These visas “cost” 11000 Euro. The organized criminal group sold them to migrants at 13000 Euro. Once in the European Union, irregular migrants were to get rid of their own identity documents and keep only the fraudulent ones. Following June 2011, this modus operandi faced obstacles since embassies in Europe became reluctant to easily issue visas to Chinese nationals.The overall prices of the smuggling venture varied: between 18500 Euro and 20000 Euro – Vietnam to United Kingdom; 14000 Euro – Vietnam to France; between 13000 Euro and 15000 Euro – Vietnam to Czech Republic; 7000 – Czech Republic to France. Sometimes the payment was required before beginning the travel. Other times, migrants were allowed to pay part of the price once in Europe. On occasion, the payment of a deposit was demanded. As for the transfer of funds, migrants usually delivered the payment to small businesses in Vietnam (usually jewelry shops), which wired the money to assigned contacts in Europe.Defendant 9 was deemed the leader of the organized criminal group. Defendants 2 and 4 were his men of trust. The other defendants were intermediaries and middle-men, the functions of whom varied between recruiting irregular migrants in Vietnam, arranging for fraudulent documentation, accommodating migrants, collecting travel “prices”, transporting migrants, etc.Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 did not possess valid documents to enter and stay in France. They were thus accused of illegal entry and stay.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, especially from the irregular migrants and defendants. An interpreter appointed by the court assisted several of them. The defendants essentially denied the accusations held against them or recognized some minor participation therein. This notwithstanding, electronic and physical surveillance as well as searches were crucial in confirming the facts as exposed above.Legal findingsAll defendants were convicted of migrants smuggling in the context of an organised criminal group. Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 were acquitted of illegal entry and stay in national territory. For further details see  “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,0
"The defendant was accused of having facilitated, on 2 April 2008, in Perpignan (France), the irregular entry, transit and stay of a foreign national into France.

"The defendant (Binh Thanh Le), a vendor on the darknet Wall Street Market (“Eastsidehigh”), and his two co-conspirators (Steven McCall and Allante Pires), were charged “with conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess with the intent to distribute” drugs, such as MDMA and ketamine, in violation of U.S. law. The defendant’s operations were revealed pursuant to U.S. postal service and other law enforcement investigations. The defendant received wholesale drugs and related raw materials, processed these drugs and/or manufactured drugs based on raw materials, and shipped them to buyers by postal service.  A search of the defendant’s home revealed packages with vacuum sealed bags containing drugs that had been purposely mislabeled (“Lego box for kids”). Border security agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection also intercepted packages from the defendant and co-conspirators, which contained illicit drugs. The defendant “pleaded guilty to conspiracy to manufacture, distribute and possess with intent to distribute” drugs and was required to forfeit over 59 bitcoin, USD 114,680, the proceeds from the sale of his vehicle, his currency counter, and pill press. For his crime, he received eight years’ imprisonment, followed by 3 years supervision upon release from prison.",cybercrime,0
"This case concerns the defendant Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, one of the leaders of a transnational network that facilitated computer intrusions, fraudulent schemes, and money laundering. The defendant was a Nigerian national and resident of the United Arab Emirates at the time of offending.From January 2019 to June 2020, the defendant conspired with multiple other persons to conduct financial transactions into, within, and outside the United States involving property that represented the proceeds of wire fraud. The co-conspirators targeted multiple victims and laundered and/or attempted to launder funds fraudulently obtained, as well as attempted to fraudulently obtain funds, through bank cyber-heists, business email compromise (“BEC”) frauds, and other fraud schemes. In December 2019, the defendant began conspiring with a co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator A”) to defraud a businessperson, who was seeking a lender to invest USD 15,000,000 in a project to build an international school. The defendant began communicating with the businessperson using an alias and promised to assist in opening a bank account in the United States, where the loan could be deposited. The defendant arranged for another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator B”) to open a bank account at Wells Fargo Bank in Canoga Park, California in the name of a Qatari company, and file a fictitious business name statement in order to register a fictitious business entity. Subsequently, the defendant directed a co-conspirator in Nigeria (“Co-conspirator C”) to create a false and fraudulent power of attorney bearing the name of the Qatari company.  The defendant then forwarded the bank information and power of attorney to the businessperson. The defendant and Co-Conspirator A each corresponded with the businessperson to fraudulently induce the businessperson to pay approximately USD 330,000 to fund the opening of a purported “investor’s account” in order to facilitate the transfer of the USD 15,000,000 loan they promised the businessperson. The defendant himself directed the businessperson to make wire transfers of USD 230,000 to the Wells Fargo bank account of a luxury watch-seller and USD 100,000 to a Capital One bank account of another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator D”), which the businessperson did.The defendant used these funds for his personal benefit, and none of the funds were used as promised to the businessperson. The defendant used the wire transfer of USD 230,000 to purchase a luxury Richard Mille RM11-03 watch and arranged for the watch-seller to have the watch available in the New York metropolitan area, where Co-conspirator D picked it up.  Co-conspirator D and another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator E”) arranged to have the watch delivered to a different co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator F”), who was directed by the defendant to transport the watch to the United Arab Emirates in January 2020.The defendant further directed Co-conspirator D to withdraw the USD 100,000 transferred to her and convert a portion of them - minus USD 8,000 as payment for Co-conspirator D – to the Nigerian currency, which she would then send to co-conspirators who would deliver the funds to the defendant using transfers between Nigerian bank accounts. The defendant also arranged to have Co-conspirator D send cashier’s checks of USD 40,000 and USD 10,000 to another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator G”) who would use the funds to obtain St. Christopher (St. Kitts) and Nevis’ citizenship and a passport for the defendant, which he received in February 2020.In January and February 2020, the defendant and Co-conspirator A corresponded with the businessperson, attempting to fraudulently induce the businessperson to pay USD 575,000 in purported “taxes” to release the loan. In February, the businessperson wire transferred approximately USD 300,000 to bank accounts in Kenya.In the beginning of March 2020, the defendant further fraudulently induced the businessperson to send additional wire transfers to U.S. bank accounts, namely USD 100,000 to Co-conspirator D and USD 80,000 to a different co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator H”). The funds from these payments were subsequently laundered through a variety of means, with the assistance of Co-conspirators D, E, G, and H.The defendant later admitted to the following approximate actual or intended loss amounts, foreseeable to him, in connection with the victims identified:- Foreign Financial Institution: approximately USD 14,700,000.00; - Victim Companies in the U.K.: approximately USD 7,740,000.00;  - Victim Law Firm: USD 922,857.76;  - and Victim Businessperson and Qatari Victim Company: USD 809,983.58.The defendant was arrested by U.A.E. law enforcement officials in June 2020. After his expulsion from the U.A.E., FBI special agents obtained custody of Abbas and brought him to the United States to stand trial.In April 2021, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in money laundering. He was sentenced to over eleven years in prison and ordered to pay USD 1,732,841 in restitution to two fraud victims in November 2022.",cybercrime,1
"The defendant, Ruben Andre Garcia, engaged in coercion, force, and fraud to cause women to engage in commercial sex acts. Specifically, between 2013 and 2019, he recruited young women to participate in commercial sex act videos, which were later posted on pornography websites, GirlsDoPorn (GDP), GirlsDoToys (GDT), and PornHub, without the women’s consent. He duped the women by making false representations that the videos would not be posted online, made available in the U.S., or be seen by anyone the women knew.Several other co-conspirators (Michael James Pratt, Matthew Isaac Wolfe, Theodore Wilfred Gyi, Valorie Moser, and others) participated in the sex trafficking conspiracy. The defendant, and a co-conspirator (Pratt), also a recruiter, posted fake advertisements online on Craigslist (an online classified advertisement website) for modeling jobs. To convince the victims responding to the advertisements to participate in the filming of pornographic videos, the defendant, Pratt and other co-conspirators had other women, who were paid a fee for recruitment efforts and each time a victim agreed to be filmed, contact victims to assure them that the videos would not be made available online, in the U.S., or to anyone they know. Victims complained about painful sex acts requesting that filming stop, to no avail, and were frequently threatened with lawsuits and the posting of their videos online, the cancelation of tickets for their flights home, and the blocking of the victims’ exit from the hotel rooms with equipment where they were filming the videos to make the women feel that they could not leave.The defendant pleaded guilty to “conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion” and “sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion.” For his crimes, the defendant received 240 months’ imprisonment.Two of the defendant’s co-conspirators (Gyi and Moser) each pled guilty to “conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion”. Another co-conspirator (Amberlyn Dee Nored) had the charges against her dismissed, another is currently a fugitive (Pratt), and the other (Wolfe) is still awaiting trial.",cybercrime,0
"The defendant (Maksim Berezan), a Latvian national, was a member of an exclusive website (“DirectConnection”) for cybercriminals engaging in cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes. To become of a member of the site, prospective users had to have three existing DirectConnection members vouch for them and had to provide information about their prior criminal history and reputation.  The existing DirectConnection members who would vouch for the prospective member would have to pay a fee as “insurance” to existing members in the event that the new member did not follow through with agreements with other members.   DirectConnection had forums with threads dedicated to specific issues of interest to members. The site also enabled users to send private messages through the site. Members also communicated off the site through Jabber and ICQ. DirectConnection had administrators, moderators, and arbiters to adjudicate disputes pursuant to the site’s dispute resolution mechanism. The defendant engaged in carding on DirectConnection, specializing in “cashouts” (i.e., the use of stolen card data and PINs to steal money from accounts or use the data to make fraudulent purchases) and “drops” (i.e., a who person receives, or forwards fraudulently obtained goods or money or a location where fraudulently obtained goods or money is dropped off). Electronic evidence in this case revealed that the defendant engaged in ransomware activities as well.The defendant was arrested in Latvia and extradited from Latvia to the United States of America to be prosecuted for his cybercrimes. The defendant pleaded guilty to “conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349” and “conspiracy to commit access device fraud and computer intrusions, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371”.

"Maksym Nienadov, a Ukrainian citizen, set up a company called Healthy Nation through which he manufactured and sold counterfeit medicine from at least July 2018 up to January 2019. As the business grew, he was joined by Volodymyr Nikolaienko.In June 2018, undercover U.S. authorities began communicating with Nienadov about the illegal sale of Keytruda on WhatsApp. A months-long exchange, which also involved Nikolaienko and resulted in the unlawful sale of counterfeit or unapproved Keytruda, Abraxane and Epclusa (Cancer and Hepatitis B drugs), followed. For the wire transfer, law enforcement received Nienadov’s banking information, which included the name “Maksim Nenadov” and his Ukrainian bank account number. After several transactions and the analysis of the counterfeit drugs by the registered trademark holders, undercover law enforcement invited the two defendants to Texas to discuss further business deals. Upon their arrival in Texas, US, the defendants were arrested and taken into custody on 18 April 2019.Neither Nienadov nor Nikolaienko were medical doctors, pharmacists or licensed pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States and they did not have authorisation to fabricate nor to sell the drugs.The defendants were charged with conspiracy, misbranded drugs, counterfeit drugs, trafficking in counterfeit drugs, and smuggling goods into the US.",cybercrime,1
"The leader (C.H.-M.) and two other high-ranking members (M.J.R. and S.A.S.) of a transnational criminal organization engaged in migrant smuggling operations in Tecate, Mexico. They were charged with various violations of Title 8, section 1324, of the United States Code, including alien smuggling, conspiracy to bring illegal aliens into the United States for financial gain, and conspiracy to transport undocumented aliens within the United States for financial gain. The organization had illegally smuggled migrants from Mexico through the southern border of California for a fee of US$ 8,000 per person. M.J.R. and S.A.S had arranged meetings at hotels and motels to obtain the fees. Arrangements had subsequently been made to send the fees to C.H.-M. in Mexico.ICT played an integral role in the logistics of the migrant smuggling operations. In particular, the leader, higher-ranking members and associates of the criminal organization used a well-known messaging application to communicate and coordinate with each other before and during smuggling operations. M.J.R. and other criminal associates were responsible for recruiting drivers for the smuggling operations. Drivers were recruited through employment advertisements on an online classified advertisement site and other websites. Among those recruited were secondary school students from San Diego, California. C.H.-M. also used ICT to monitor and track movements of operatives and migrants, as well as to inform drivers of the pick-up locations for migrants by using a well-known mapping and navigation application for mobile devices.",cybercrime,1
"This case regards the defendant’s involvement in a computer-based intrusion fraud scheme. A chief financial officer of one company, namely Unatrac Holding Limited, received an email that purportedly contained a web link to the Microsoft Office 365 login page. The victim, having an email account with this host, trusted the link and viewed it as legitimate. After clicking on the link he received in the phishing email, the page he was sent to resembled the Microsoft Office 365 login page. For this reason, the chief financial officer input his login credentials, which unbeknownst to him, were captured by criminals, including the defendant, who then used this information to access his account. His email account was then used to send fraudulent emails requesting wire transfers from other members of the company’s financial team. What is more, having observed company policy and the internal practice of forwarding emails from vendors, the perpetrator forwarded a fictitious email he had created to make it look as if a vendor was sending an invoice. Ultimately, this fraudulent scheme resulted in approximately USD 11,000,000 of wire transfers sent to the defendant and his co-conspirators.On 2 August 2019, a criminal complaint was filed against the defendant accusing him of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

"This case involves a member of the cyber organized criminal group “The Dark Overlord” (TDO), an organization that was known for their ransom and extortion scams. Beginning in 2016, the defendant was involved in a conspiracy that encompassed hacking several organizations in health, entertainment, finance, commercial, real estate, and transportation, stealing personal information from the systems they hacked, including for instance medical records, and then seeking ransom from the targets. Companies would usually have to pay a ransom of between USED 75,000 and 350,000 in bitcoin.

"This case involved Bryan Connor Herrell, an “employee” of the dark net site “AlphaBay” who was involved in moderating thousands of illegal transactions under various monikers, including “Penissmith” and “Botah.” From 2016 through July 2017 AlphaBay was the world’s largest online black market, and shortly before its shut down in 2017 it hosted approximately 368,810 listings for the sale of various illicit goods, approximately 350,000 active buyer accounts, and over 9,000 active vendor accounts.AlphaBay was created by Alexandre Cazes, who was prosecuted separately before committing suicide while in custody, in or around July 2014. The marketplace was designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. Numerous vendors used AlphaBay to distribute controlled substances and illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars gained from these illegal transactions. At the time of writing, the site is known to have facilitated the distribution in excess of 90kg of heroin, 450kg of cocaine, and 45kg of methamphetamine.The only way to access AlphaBay was through The Onion Router (“Tor”) network. This network anonymized the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of its underlying servers and allowed vendors and buyers to hide their true identities. Additional measures were also taken to keep identities hidden as AlphaBay required its users to transact in digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum, and did not allow for transactions in official, government-backed currencies. By only accepting digital currencies, AlphaBay and its users were able to bypass the traditional financial systems. AlphaBay was set up like a conventional e-commerce website as a search tool allowed users to choose the type of illegal goods or services they wished to purchase, and users were able to sign up for free by choosing a screen name and password for their account. Furthermore, users could also search by price ranges, popularity of items, vendors, origin or shipping country, and payment types.The defendant Herrell and other co-conspirators (both known and unknown to the Grand Jury) were members and associates of AlphaBay. The marketplace operated as criminal enterprise with “employees” serving as security administrators, moderators, public relations specialists, and scam watchers (whose primary duty is to identify and remove fraudulent listings), meaning that leaders, members, and associates of AlphaBay had defined roles in the organization. The defendant in this case held the position of moderator from about May 2016 through July 2017. As moderator, Herrell had access to portions of the AlphaBay platform that were not available to the general public and had the authority to refund payments from buyers on the website, restore a user’s access to the site, engage in staff-only discussions and meetings, and view the amount of digital currency available to other members of the AlphaBay organization. Moderators also held the responsibility of moderating disputes between buyers and vendors on AlphaBay. For his work as a moderator, Herrell was paid four bitcoins per week (bitcoin was worth about USD 2,000 per coin in May 2016, and about USD 2,600 in July 2017). Through moderating disputes, the defendant Herrell had full visibility and awareness of the criminal activities occurring on AlphaBay and therefore held a role in directly facilitating these criminal activities. In addition, Herrell also held the position of scam watcher from around August 2015 to December 2015, where he monitored and quashed phishing attempts and other scams being carried out on AlphaBay. Herrell was also paid in bitcoin for this work.In 2017, Bryan Connor Herrell was indicted on the felony crime of Conspiracy to Engage in Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, USD 250,000 criminal fine, and up to 3 years supervised release. Additionally, upon conviction of this offence, Herrell also was subject to a forfeiture of property pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1963(a)(1) - (a)(3).

"This case involves the sentencing of a Russian national who operated two websites facilitating payment card fraud, computer hacking, and other crimes.According to the official documents, the defendant, Aleksei Burkov, operated a website called “Card Planet,” which offered stolen credit card data that had been obtained mostly through computer intrusion. There were hundreds of thousands of victims, many of them U.S. citizens. Over 150,000 stolen credit card numbers from over 1,300 banks were offered for purchase. Regarding cards of U.S. accounts alone, this resulted in over USD 20 million in fraudulent purchases.In addition, the defendant operated another website, which was invite-only, where elite cybercriminals could advertise stolen goods (i.e. personal identification data), malicious software, and criminal services, including money laundering and hacking services. To obtain membership, prospective members needed three existing members to “vouch” for them and pay a sum of money, usually USD 5,000, as insurance. These measures were aimed at avoid detection from law enforcement authorities as well as guaranteeing that their members valued the deals made on the website. To the same end, the forum removed arrested members from the site by banning them to prevent law enforcement agencies from using the arrested member and/or arrested member’s details to access the site.The defendant was arrested at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel, in December 2015. On 4 February 2016, the defendant was charged with conspiring to commit access device fraud (included in two counts), identity theft, computer intrusion, wire fraud (included in two counts), and money laundering, as well as with access device fraud and wire fraud in a superseding indictment. In 2017, an Israeli district court approved the extradition of the defendant to the United States. After the denial of the defendant’s appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli High Court of Justice, the defendant was finally extradited on 11 November 2019. On 23 January 2020, The defendant pleaded guilty to one count of access device fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, identity theft, computer intrusions, wire fraud, and money laundering on 23 January 2020. The judge sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment on 26 June 2020.",cybercrime,1
"This case involves several offences, including conspiracy, smuggling cultural property into the U.S., obstruction of justice, and citizenship and naturalization fraud, committed by the defendant Ijaz Khan with the assistance of several co-conspirators. In 2002, the co-conspirator Vera Lautt travelled to Pakistan to meet Ijaz Khan, whom she had met online, and to sign marriage documents. Subsequently, they both submitted fraudulent documents to the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), facilitating the immigration and later naturalization of Ijaz Khan. The defendant Ijaz Khan was, however, still married to a Pakistani woman, with whom he had and continued to have children, at the time of and after signing the marriage documents. According to the indictment, Ijaz Khan used his citizenship to enable the immigration and later naturalization of his four oldest sons. He divorced Lautt before the children had arrived in the United States. He further filed or assisted with petitions on behalf of his brother, Ibar Khan, his Pakistani wife, his mother, and another two children.Following his immigration from approximately 2007 until May 2014, Ijaz and Fahad Khan, together with others, conspired to smuggle cultural artifacts (e.g., coins, pottery, arrowheads and bronze weapons) that were stolen from burial sites from Pakistan into the United States. The defendant used his company, Indus Valley, to sell the stolen cultural artifacts to his existing customer base, in person at shows, and online (on websites and auction sites, like eBay).In October 2013, a shipment was inspected and seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Subsequently, Ijaz and Fahad Khan, together with their co-conspirator John Bryan McNamara, conspired to submit fraudulent documents purporting to be from the Pakistan government authorizing his export of the cultural artifacts and certifying the value of objects. McNamara had previously pleaded guilty to smuggling the artifacts into the U.S. and making false statements to special agents when interrogated about this shipment.The defendant was identified as the leader and organizer of an organized criminal group made up of family members (e.g., wife and sons) and others who were not related to the defendant (e.g., McNamara). He played a central role in planning and operations, recruitment of accomplices, and controlled and exercised authority over others in the group. Because of his central leadership role, he received a sentencing enhancement, which he unsuccessfully appealed. The defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, a fine of approximately USD 115,000, and was required to forfeit more than 1,300 cultural artifacts. The defendant unsuccessfully appealed his conviction and sentence to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.Others in the organized criminal group pleaded guilty and were also sentenced for their roles in the conspiracy to commit smuggling, including Vera Lautt and John Bryan McNamara, who received four months’ imprisonment (and two years’ supervised release from prison) and two years of probation, respectively.",cybercrime,1
"A group of five defendants participated in a worldwide ponzi scheme, the BitClub Network, which defrauded cryptocurrency investors. The BitClub Network required membership fees, “solicited money from investors in exchange for shares of pooled investments in cryptocurrency mining,” and “rewarded existing investors for recruiting new investors.” The funds provided by investors were purportedly required to sustain the cryptocurrency mining pools by, for example, purchasing equipment and computing power. The profits made by investors supposedly depended on the success of the mining pool operations and the number of shares investors had in the mining pools. To lure investors, keep existing investors, and get investors to provide money, the defendants fraudulently represented earnings. The group fraudulently “obtained at least [USD]… 722 million from investors.” The BCN shares sold were not registered as “securities” with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as required by law. Two of the five defendants pled guilty: Joseph Frank Abel pled guilty to “conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities” and Silviu Catalin Balaci to “conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to offer and sell unregistered securities.” At the time of writing, the remaining three defendants (Matthew Brent Goettsche, Russ Albert Medlin, Jobadiah Sinclair Weeks) have not yet been tried.",cybercrime,0
"The organized criminal group involved in this case perpetrated several cybercrimes, one of which was online auction fraud. According to the indictment, this fraud was perpetrated by members of the group by posting “hundreds or thousands of listings for automobiles, motorcycles, and other high-priced goods on eBay and similar auction sites.” The images of the items being sold that were included in these postings were infected with malware (i.e., the Bayrob Trojan). When individuals clicked on the images of the items, their devices were infected with the malware, which was designed to redirect these individuals to webpages that looked identical to the legitimate websites of the auction sites. For example, their fake eBay pages included the trademark of the organization and had a similar layout, design, and style of the legitimate eBay webpages with an important key difference. The fake eBay webpages prompted users to pay for the auctioned items using something called an “eBay escrow agent,” which does not exist on the legitimate platform. This purported service claimed to hold the money of the buyer in escrow until the item was received and the buyer was satisfied with the condition of the item delivered before the buyer’s funds were released to the seller. The webpages also included a live chat function that supposedly enabled individuals to speak with customer service agents of eBay; of course, these were not real eBay customer service agents, they were members of the group. The victims of this online auction fraud never received the items they paid for and never received a refund for the money they paid for the non-delivered items.One of the defendants (T.D.) pled guilty to aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy offences relating to wire fraud and money laundering, and received 10 years imprisonment for his crimes. B.N. and R.M. were charged, convicted, and sentenced to 20 and 18 years’ imprisonment, respectively, for aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy offences relating to wire fraud and money laundering, as well as conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit service marks.",cybercrime,1
"Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator Brandon Arias used the moniker “The Drug Llama” on a vendor account on Dream Market (a Darknet site) to sell counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl. Melissa Scanlan was responsible for sourcing the drugs that would be sold using via the vendor account, while Brandon Arias was responsible for receiving and fulfilling Darknet drug orders, as well as the management of the account. Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator received fentanyl and other narcotics from Mexico, predominantly from Fausto Ramirez and another (unnamed) member of the Mexican cartel. After Melissa Scanlan and Brandon Arias sold the drugs, they kept a portion of the proceeds and gave the remaining criminal proceeds to couriers (usually Norma Dominguez and April Kelly, both females). The couriers would transport the proceeds across U.S.-Mexican border and deliver them to Fausto Ramirez and another member of a Mexican cartel. In one year alone, an estimated 52,000 counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl pills were sold.Melissa Scanlan was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, misbranding of drugs, international money laundering conspiracy, and distribution of fentanyl resulting in death. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 13 years and 4 months’ imprisonment.Brandon Arias was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, and misbranding of drugs.

"This case involves Gary Davis, a member of the small administrative “staff” of the Darknet marketplace “Silk Road.” During its operation from 2011 until 2013, Silk Road was used to distribute illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to more than 100,000 buyers, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of proceeds of these illicit transactions.From June to 2 October 2013, Davis, also known under his alias “Libertas,” worked as a site administrator on Silk Road. He was responsible for responding to customer support requests regarding the need for assistance with buyer or seller accounts, serving as an arbitrator by resolving disputes between drug dealers and their customers, and enforcing the rules for doing business on Silk Road, such as the rule against out of escrow sales. Davis was paid a weekly salary for his administrative services on the marketplace.Shortly after law enforcement authorities had shut down Silk Road in October 2013, its virtually identical successor, Silk Road 2.0, emerged. Davis also served as an administrator for the successor website from November to December 2013.The defendant, along with two of his co-conspirators, was charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy on 19 December 2013. Davis was arrested in Ireland in January 2014 and extradited to the United States in July 2018. Davis pleaded guilty to narcotics trafficking conspiracy on 5 October 2018 and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release on 25 July 2019. He was further ordered to forfeit USD 25,000. At the time of writing, no official information is available on the convictions of his co-defendants, Andrew Michael Jones and Peter Phillip Nash.",cybercrime,1
"The defendant, Mr Gary Davis (aka “Libertas”) worked for the Silk Road website from June 2013 until 2 October 2013 (when the website was shutdown).Silk Road was an online black market created by Mr Ross Ulbricht where a wide range of illegal goods and services could be bought and sold. The platform resembled other online market places in that it required a username and password to log in, offered users a “shopping cart”, and had other like features). A variety of illicit drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy, and opioids were available for purchase on the website. The drugs purchased on Silk Road caused real harm—drugs purchased on Silk Road resulted in six deaths for overdose (though there is no suggestion that Mr Davis was responsible for any of these deaths). Counterfeit and fraudulent identity documents were also available for sale on the website—including, for instance, counterfeit US and foreign passports, US and foreign drivers’ licenses, and social security cards. Computer hacking tools and services were also available for purchase on Silk Road, including password hacking tools and services, Remote Access Tools (RAT) which allows users to obtain unauthorised remote access to a compromised computer, keyloggers which permit a user to monitor keystrokes inputted by a victim into his or her computer and used to steal confidential information, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) services which disable websites or other publicly available services on the Internet by using large networks of compromised computers to flood victim systems with malicious internet traffic. Finally, Silk Road offered money laundering services to its users, many of which were directly marketed to vendors who sold goods or services on the website. Money laundering services aimed at converting proceeds of illegal transactions (obtained in Bitcoin, the required means of payment on the Silk Road website) into other forms of currency. Vendors in this category offered, among other things, the sale of US currency, anonymous debit cards preloaded with currency and other prepaid payment systems, such as Moneypak cards.Silk Road was only accessible through the Tor network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed round the work and designed to conceal the true IP of the computers on the network and, thereby, the identities of users.The required and only payment system on Silk Road was Bitcoin—an entirely electronic currency, not issued by any bank or state, generated and controlled automatically through computer software operating on a peer-to-peer network, and operated through blockchain stored on the peer-to-peer network. On Silk Road, every user had one (or more) Silk Road Bitcoin address associated with their own Silk Road account. The Bitcoin address could be used by each user to deposit funds into their Silk Road account. These addresses were stored on “wallet” files maintained on computer servers controlled by Mr Ulbricht. To make purchases on the website, therefore, a user had to first obtain Bitcoin (for example, from a Bitcoin exchanger) and send these to a Bitcoin address associated with the user’s Silk Road account. Once the purchase took place, the funds were debited from the user’s Silk Road account and held in escrow in a wallet file maintained by Silk Road pending completion of the transaction. Once the transaction was completed the vendor’s Silk Road account would be credited with the payment minus the commission Silk Road took on the sale (8–15% of the transaction). The vendor would then withdraw the Bitcoins from his Silk Road account by transferring them to an outside Bitcoin address, such as the address of a Bitcoin exchanger who would cash out the Bitcoins for real currency. The vendors would also convert their Bitcoins into other currencies, by using money laundering services offered on the website.Silk Road would also use a so-called “tumbler” to hinder the tracking of individual transactions through the blockchain. In a nutshell, the “tumbler” would obscure any link between both the buyer’s and the vendor’s Bitcoin addresses. It would, therefore, make the use of blockchain to follow the money trail useless, even if both the vendor’s and buyer’s Bitcoin addresses were known.Mr Ulbricht ran the website with some support staff (they were four when Silk Road was shutdown by law enforcement on 2 October 2013), who were divided into forum moderators and site administrators. Forum moderators were responsible for, among other things, monitoring user activity on discussion forums associated with the site, providing guidance to forum users concerning how to conduct business on Silk Road, and reporting any significant problems discussed on the forums to the site administrators and Mr Ulbricht. Site administrators were in charge of responding to customer support requests from Silk Road users who needed assistance with their buyer or seller accounts; investigating disputes that arose between vendors and buyers, including reporting their findings to Mr Andrew Michael Jones (another site administrator) or Mr Ulbricht; and helping enforce the rules for doing business on Silk Road. This last responsibility included demoting vendors or referring them to Mr Ulbricht for further discipline. This could happen when vendors and buyers would communicate on Silk Road and decide to conclude the sale offsite to avoid paying to Silk Road a commission (this was called “out of escrow” sales).Mr Gary Davis first worked for a month as a forum moderator of Silk Road. He then was “promoted” to site administrator. As a site administrator, he demoted an account that was likely compromised by the police and posted some posts on the forum advising users how to conceal their true identities. When Silk Road was shut down by law enforcement on 2 October 2013, Mr Davis helped with the launch of “Silk Road 2.0”, a website which was created in the month following Silk Road’s demise. Mr Davis used his credibility with the original Silk Road community to vouch for the new website. He worked on the new version of Silk Road as a site administrator for one month, until he was arrested in Ireland in January 2014.Mr Davis was extradited from Ireland to the US in July 2018. He pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to traffic a controlled substance (narcotics). He was sentenced to six years and six months’ imprisonment on 25 July 2019.",cybercrime,1
"Between 2015 and 2017, the defendant Sergiy Petrovich Usatyuk and a co-conspirator deployed booter services for financial gain, allowing paying users to utilize their services to launch DDoS attacks. Specifically, the defendant and the co-conspirator developed software and created, controlled, and operated a website and infrastructure (e.g., domain names and servers in the U.S. and Romania) to enable paying users to deploy DDoS attacks. One of the most popular booter services used included ExoStresser. Other services offered included Betabooter, Databooter, DecafeStresser, Instabooter, IP Booters, IP Stressors, Polystress, QuezStresser, and Zstress. The booter services the defendant provided along with his co-conspirator were used to conduct 1,367,610 DDoS attacks against systems inside and outside of the United States. These DDoS attacks not only caused harm to the computer systems directly targeted, but also caused harm to computers systems not directly targeted by the attacks. The defendant and the co-conspirator also created and maintained the payment and cryptocurrency accounts needed to obtain the proceeds of crime. The defendant and co-conspirators further engaged in tactics to conceal their identities and activities. In 2019, the defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to cause damage to protected computers. That same year, the defendant was sentenced to 13 months’ imprisonment and three years of supervised release following the completion of the sentence.

"This case involved a sextortion scheme perpetrated by inmates in the South Carolina Department of Corrections, as well as co-conspirators outside of the prison, against U.S. military personnel. In this sextortion scheme, the inmates, using smartphones they smuggled into the prison, signed up for dating apps and targeted U.S. military members utilizing these apps. The defendants and co-conspirators created fake profiles of women using images that they found online. After contacting the targets and obtaining personal information from them, the inmates would send naked images of the person they were impersonating (images which were also found online) and request that the targets provide nude images. The inmates would then call the targets impersonating the father of the person the targets were in contact with (i.e., the women in the profile). The inmates would proceed to misinform the targets that they were communicating with a minor and that what the targets had in their possession (i.e., the naked image) was considered child sexual abuse material. The inmates would then threaten to contact the authorities and report the individuals if money was not paid to the “victim”. The targets were directed to pay these fees using wire transfers via Western Union, MoneyGram, Walmart, and PayPal. The inmates recruited money mules, who received the wire transfers from the military members and would then send the funds to the inmates as directed.The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, extortion, and money laundering. Several of the defendants pled guilty. Specifically, Tiffany Reed pled guilty and was sentenced to three years’ probation for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Another defendant, Wendell Wilkins, also pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, but has yet to be sentenced. Jalisa Thompson, Brandon Thompson pled guilty to money laundering and were sentenced to time served and 15 months’ imprisonment, respectively. The prosecution also submitted a motion to dismiss the indictment against one of the defendants, namely, Laben McCoy.

"This case involved Ronald L. Wheeler, an “employee” of the dark net site “AlphaBay” who was involved in, inter alia, moderating the AlphaBay subreddit, moderating the AlphaBay message board forums, and mediating sales disputes, under the monikers “Trappy” and “Trappy_Pandora.” From 2016 through July 2017, AlphaBay was the world’s largest online black market, and shortly before its shut down in 2017, hosted approximately 368,810 listings for the sale of various illicit goods, approximately 350,000 active buyer accounts, and over 9,000 active vendor accounts.AlphaBay was created by Alexandre Cazes, who was prosecuted separately before committing suicide while in custody, in or around July 2014. The marketplace was designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. Numerous vendors used AlphaBay to distribute controlled substances and illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars gained from these illegal transactions. At the time of writing, the site is known to have facilitated the distribution in excess of 90kg of heroin, 450kg of cocaine, and 45kg of methamphetamine.The only way to access AlphaBay was through The Onion Router (“Tor”) network. This network anonymized the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of its underlying servers and allowed vendors and buyers to hide their true identities. Additional measures were also taken to keep identities hidden as AlphaBay required its users to transact in digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum, and did not allow for transactions in official, government-backed currencies. By only accepting digital currencies, AlphaBay and its users were able to bypass the traditional financial systems. AlphaBay was set up like a conventional e-commerce website, as a search tool allowed users to choose the type of illegal goods or services they wished to purchase, and users were able to sign up for free by choosing a screen name and password for their account. Furthermore, users could also search by price ranges, popularity of items, vendors, origin or shipping country, and payment types.On 25 May 2015 at the latest, the defendant began working for AlphaBay as a public relations specialist. His duties included moderating the AlphaBay subreddit on the website reddit.com, moderating the AlphaBay message board forums, mediating sales disputes among AlphaBay users, promoting AlphaBay online, and providing non-technical assistance to AlphaBay users. The defendant was paid in Bitcoin for his services. His work continued until the website was shut down.The defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit acces device fraud.

"This case involves a transnational criminal organization (called the “Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network” by U.S. authorities in the criminal indictment) which perpetrated online auction fraud (i.e., advertising and selling non-existent items) against U.S. victims on eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, and AutoTrader.com. The organization primarily operated in Alexandria, Romania, with some operations taking place in other areas of Eastern Europe, as well as the United States. The victims of the online auction fraud paid for the fake items with “reloadable prepaid cards, prepaid debit cards, and gift cards of varying types (collectively referred to herein as ‘prepaid debit cards’), including Green Dot Moneypaks, Visa One Vanilla prepaid debit cards, PayPal My Cash cards, and Amazon gift cards; United States postal money orders; cashier’s checks; MoneyGram and Western Union wires; and bank wires and deposits.”The Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network worked with others to launder criminal proceeds, by taking the money paid by victims for the fake items sold online, converting the money to Bitcoin, transferring the Bitcoin to members and associates in Eastern Europe, and using Bitcoin exchanges to convert the Bitcoin to fiat currency. Associates of the organizations in the United States, such as J.A.V., obtained victim payments, converted them to Bitcoins, and sent the Bitcoins to members of the organization who had perpetrated the online auction fraud. Third-party money launderers in the U.S. (i.e., A.E.N., D.A.B., and R.W.D.L.T) were also used to collect, redeem, and convert victim payment into cash or Bitcoins. Additionally, two Bitcoin exchangers were used by the Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network. Particularly, a Bulgarian national (Rossen Iossifov) owner of a Bitcoin exchange (RG Coins), registered in Bulgaria, was charged and convicted for conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit money laundering in contravention of U.S. laws.

"This case involves an international online child sexual exploitation ring, the Bored group, which met, organized its activities, and operated exclusively online. The Bored group earned this nickname because the chatrooms they created all included the word “bored” in them. Initially, the group met on Stickham, a social media platform which was popular for live streaming video chats. Frustrated with the moderation that existed on this site, they migrated to other sites and ultimately ended up using one unidentified site that was not moderated. The chatrooms they created on this site could not be found unless the person knew the URL of the chatroom.The perpetrators devised and executed a plan to lure targets from moderated platforms to an unmoderated chatroom-based forum and entice them to engage in sex acts. Specifically, the members of the group worked together to recruit, entice, and coerce minors to engage in sex acts during video-chat sessions. To accomplish this, members of the group created fake profiles of teenage boys on social media and dating sites, such as MYLOL.com, Periscope, YouNow, and Gifyo, to target minor girls. The members would then identify minors to target, contact, and communicate with in order to get the victims to join the offenders in unmonitored chatrooms. All of the members of the group spent a considerable amount of time communicating with their targets in order to gain their trust, build rapport with them, and ultimately, entice the victims to commit sex acts. Beyond communication, Bored group members used several techniques to manipulate victims, including:1. Dares. Daring minors to engage in sexualized behaviour and sex acts.2. Polls. Running polls with participants in the chat rooms about the attractiveness of minors and/or voting on what type of items of clothing the minor should remove and/or what type of sex act the minor should engage in.3. Competitions. Minors were pitted against each other in an effort to be rewarded (i.e., they would receive points for engaging in certain sexualized behaviour and sex acts, and advance levels based on points).4. Purporting to Block Cameras. To reduce the inhibitions of minors, members who victims trusted (called “handlers”) would claim that they could block the camera and prevent others in the chatroom from viewing the victims. When the handler told other group members that this tactic was used, the participants in the chatroom would pretend that they were unable to see the victim’s web camera.  5. Loops. Pre-recorded videos of minors talking and/or engaging in sexualized behaviour or sex acts.  These videos were played as if they were occurring in real-time in order to manipulate a minor into engaging in similar conduct and/or acts. The Bored group had distinct roles for members: hunters, talkers, and loopers. Hunters lured victims to the chatroom. Talkers handled the next phase, which involved convincing the minors to undress and masturbate on camera by engaging them in conversation and building trust and rapport. Loopers posed as a female minor and played a pre-recorded video of a previous victim talking or engaging in sex acts (but passed it off as if it was playing in real-time). Loopers played these pre-recorded videos in an effort to convince girls to perform a sex act.As a method to monitor, evaluate, and coordinate their activities, track progress, and share their knowledge and expertise, they would discuss their plans, activities, and experiences on a separate site (the now defunct Titan Pad) and record their activities and experiences on a password-protected spreadsheet on that site that included information about which chatrooms on the website were associated with which victims and the social media accounts associated with members that were used to lure each of the victims. The spreadsheet also enabled the members of the group to keep track of the manipulation techniques that were successful with each victim and what sex acts each victim engaged in (including extremely depraved acts; e.g., one member of the group enticed a minor to engage in a sex act with a dog). After Titan Pad ceased its operation in 2017, the Bored group moved its activities to Discord, a group chat platform, with voice and video capabilities.The defendant, Caleb Young, pled guilty to child exploitation enterprise and received 30 years’ imprisonment for his crime. Other members of the group were also charged and sentenced for their crimes. C.M., the leader of the child exploitation enterprise, received 40 years’ imprisonment for his crime. He was killed in prison during an altercation with other inmates in January 2019. Other members of the group received 38 years’ (A.S.), 37 years and 6 months’ (O.O.), 35 years’ (J.N.R.), 31 years and 3 months’ (M.F.), and 30 years and 6 months’ imprisonment (B.J.S. and D.W., each) for their crimes.

"This case involves the co-founders, administrators and members of the Infraud Organization, which was founded in 2010 and was active between 2010 and 2018. The slogan of the organization was “in fraud we trust.” The Infraud Organization operated as a criminal enterprise with its objective of financially enriching its members through cybercrimes, particularly online fraud and identity theft. The illicit acts the organization engaged in included money laundering, identity theft, counterfeit identification trafficking, bank fraud, wire fraud, among other crimes. In total, the organization caused USD 568 million in actual losses and USD 2.2 billion in intended losses. The Infraud Organization ran an online discussion forum, known as Infraud, which had over 10,000 members from around the world. According to the Second Superseding Criminal Indictment, the roles of individuals that were part of this criminal enterprise included administrators, super moderators, moderators, vendors, VIP members, and members:1. Administrators.  Administrators were responsible for “long-term strategic planning” of the enterprise, and daily management tasks, such as determining responsibilities and levels of access of all members, vetting prospective members, deciding which members can join, and rewarding and punishing existing members.2. Super Moderators. Super moderators were responsible for moderating content by reviewing contraband for sale, editing and deleting posts based on reviews, and mediating disputes between buyers and vendors (i.e., sellers). The content they moderated was assigned based on either geographic area or criminal expertise.3. Moderators. Moderators have some of the same responsibilities for moderating content, but they have less privileges and authority than super moderators. 4. Vendors. Individuals who sold and/or advertised illicit goods and services on the site.5. VIP members. VIP members were longstanding, distinguished members of the platform.6. Members.  General members of the forum.The founders of the organization are Svyatoslav Bondarenko and Sergey Medvedev. Along with being a co-founder, Sergey Medvedev served as the administrator of the site and ran the escrow service of the organization, which held funds for a purchase in escrow until the buyer received the items purchased (in good order). He further created a virtual currency exchange service where virtual currencies were exchanged for fiat currencies, promoted, created incentives, and set prices for advertisements on Infraud. The defendant assumed leadership of the organization after Svyatoslav Bondarenko disappeared.For quality control of contraband recovered from acts of fraud and identity theft, members provided feedback and ratings of vendors and their products. To protect individuals who are part of this criminal enterprise, measures were taken to secure the site and restrict access to the site. Svyatoslav Bondarenko established rules governing the conduct of members on Infraud and these rules were enforced by administrators, moderators, and supermoderators of the forum. Members who violated these rules were punished by, for example, being removed and banned from the site. All new members had to be vetted before being granted access to the forum.In this case, 36 defendants were charged for their roles in the Infraud Organization. The criminal proceedings for most of these defendants are still ongoing. The defendant, one of the founders of Infraud, Sergey Medvedev, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in a racketeer influenced corrupt organization. The other founder, Svyatoslav Bondarenko, is still at large. Two other defendants and members of Infraud pleaded guilty to engage in a racketeer influenced corrupt organization. Firstly, Jose Gamboa became a member of Infraud in December 2010 and advertised as vendor of custom-built ATM skimmers within the Infraud forum. Secondly, Valerian Chiochiu advised other members on the development and use of malware. He also developed malware that was used by other members to gain unauthorized access to personal and financial data and access device data. The illegally obtained information would then be sold on the Infraud forum to other Infraud members. The defendant also fraudulently purchased gift cards which were then sold on the Infraud forum to members for a profit.",cybercrime,0
"In or around July 2014, ALEXANDRE CAZES, aka ""ALPHA02,"" aka ""ADMIN,"" with· other persons, known and unknown to the. Grand Jury, created AlphaBay (also referred to as the ""AlphaBay Market""), a dark-web marketplace designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. The site also enabled users to purchase and sell illegal services, including “tumbling” and “mixing” services, which are forms of money laundering used for digital currencies.From its official launch in December 2014 AlphaBay was used by thousands of vendors to distribute controlled substances and other illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars deriving from these illegal transactions. AlphaBay also provided a private, internal messaging service through which staff, vendors, and buyers could communicate, as well as an associated web forum called the ""AlphaBay Market Forum."" On 1 June 2017, an arrest warrant would be issued for Alexandre CAZES that would be satisfied approximately one month later on 5 July 2017. CAZES was arrested during a raid on his home in Bangkok, Thailand and was held by the Royal Thai Police for approximately seven days before apparently committing suicide while in custody on 12 July 2017.

"This case involves several cyber and organized crime related offences of the creator of Silk Road, a massive online marketplace which sold illicit goods and services, in particular drugs. The defendant, Ross William Ulbricht, created Silk Road in January 2011, and owned and operated the website until it was shut down by law enforcement authorities in October 2013.The defendant deliberately operated Silk Road as an online criminal marketplace with the intent to facilitate its users to buy and sell illegal goods and services anonymously and under the radar of law enforcement. The defendant aimed at anonymizing transactions on Silk Road by operating Silk Road on “The Onion Router,” or “Tor” network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed around the world, designed to conceal the true IP addresses, and hence identities of its users; and by including a Bitcoin-based payment system that concealed the identities and locations of the users.The defendant controlled and oversaw every aspect of Silk Road, and managed a staff of paid, online administrators and computer programmers who assisted with the day-to-day operation of the site.  The defendant reaped commissions worth over USD 13 million generated from the illicit sales conducted through the site.The U.S. government learned of Silk Road in 2011, after intercepting a drug package in Chicago's O'Hare airport, and commenced an investigation into the online marketplace. Agents discovered that the Silk Road was run and managed by someone with the screen name of “Dread Pirate Roberts” (D.P.R.). In 2012, law enforcement agents investigated several individuals believed to be “Dread Pirate Roberts,” including Ross Ulbricht, Anand Athavale, and Mark Karpeles. Ultimately, Ulbricht became the primary suspect in 2013 after a series of “pen/trap” orders, which led U.S. law enforcement agents to collect evidence in the form of I.P. address data from Ulbricht’s home wireless network. Additional evidence came from undercover investigations, in which law enforcement agents took over low-level Silk Road administrators’ accounts and interacted with D.P.R. online, in an attempt to expose Ulbricht. In October 2013, at the San Francisco public library, agents arrested Ulbricht after catching him while he was logged in as the administrator of Silk Road and its D.P.R.The defendant was charged with and convicted of distributing narcotics, distributing narcotics by means of the Internet, conspiring to distribute narcotics, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit computer hacking, conspiring to traffic in false identity documents, and conspiring to commit money laundering. He was further accused of soliciting six murders-for-hire in connection with operating the site, although there was no evidence that these murders were actually carried out.",cybercrime,1
"The defendant, Mr Steven W Chase, founded—and, between 19 August 2014 and 4 March 2015, was the lead administrator of—a website called ‘Playpen’ dedicated to the exchange of child pornography. The site enabled users to chat, exchange, and purchase images of child sexual abuse content in an anonymous way.The site had more than 150,000 users from around the world and was believed by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to be the world’s largest child pornography website. The content of the website was divided into different ‘boards’ categorised according to the age and sex of the victims and the type of sexual activity involved.Following a slip up by Chase in December 2014, Playpen’s unique IP address was exposed to a foreign law enforcement agency. The IP address was revealed to be in the US, and the law enforcement agency notified the FBI.In January 2015 the FBI, in partnership with the US Department of Justice’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, launched ‘Operation Pacifier’, which sought to identify the members of the Playpen website and bring them to justice.On 19 February 2015, the FBI executed a search warrant of Mr Chase’s home and Mr Chase was arrested. Forensic examination of a computer and devices seized during the search found thousands of images of child exploitation material.On 16 September 2016, a federal jury found Mr Chase of multiple charges relating to child pornography and child exploitation. On 1 May 2017 he was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment for these offences.Two other men, Messrs Michael Fluckiger, 46, of Indiana, United States of America, and David Browning, 47, of Kentucky, United States of America, also acted as administrators of the Playpen website. They were each sentenced to 20-year terms of imprisonment in early 2017 after having pleaded guilty in December 2015 to charges of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise.",cybercrime,1
"This case involves the members of an organized criminal group that operated websites dedicated to the advertisement and distribution of child sexual abuse material. The website had three administrators, including Steven Chase and Michael Fluckiger, and a number of moderators, including David Lynn Browning. The website, which was hosted by a server in North Carolina, could be accessed by members only and operated on the Tor anonymity network, using elaborate file encryption to prevent the detection by law enforcement authorities. In total, more than 150,000 members authored and accessed tens of thousands of postings related to the sexual abuse of children, sometimes as young as infants or toddlers.Browning and Fluckiger were heavily involved in the day-to-day operations, which encompassed managing membership, developing and enforcing strict rules and deleting content unrelated to child sexual abuse material. Browning joined the website on 13 November 2014. Until 4 March 2015, the Browning spent over 700 hours logged in to the website, authored more than 1,000 postings, and designed the logo of the website. In 2015, a criminal complaint was filed against Browning and Fluckiger, accusing them of conspiracy to advertise child pornography contrary to 18 U.S.C. § 2251(d)(1) and (e). Fluckiger pleaded guilty on 2 December 2015 and Browning on 18 December 2015; both were sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment followed by a lifetime term of supervised release.Steven Chase was convicted of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise and related charges on 16 September 2016.

"On January 5, 2012, a grand jury returned an indictment against many of the claimants in this action, charging them with criminal copyright infringement and money laundering ""with estimated harm to copyright holders well in excess of $500,000,000 and reported income in excess of $175,000,000."" The claimants' alleged copyright infringement scheme, dubbed the ""Mega Conspiracy,"" used public websites to facilitate the illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted movies, software, television programs, and music. The government estimates that the alleged criminal conduct has caused billions of dollars in harm to the copyright holders.Following the indictment, the district court issued restraining orders for assets in New Zealand and Hong Kong where most of the remaining identified proceeds resided. The High Court in Hong Kong responded almost immediately by issuing a restraining order against approximately $60 million in assets, while New Zealand first arrested several of the now-claimants, released them on bail, and then several months later, in April, registered restraining orders on $15 million in assets. New Zealand also scheduled extradition hearings for August 2012, but these hearings have been continued at least eight times at the claimants' request.The New Zealand restraining orders could only remain registered for two years, after which they could be extended for up to one year. Recognizing that the restraints would run out on April 18, 2014, or if extended on April 18, 2015, the United States filed this civil forfeiture action against forty-eight assets restrained pursuant to the criminal indictment in the district court on July 29, 2014. Although restraining orders froze the assets in the lead up to this action, the New Zealand courts have routinely released funds to claimants for living and legal expenses. Some of these have been very substantial, including millions in legal fees for Kim Dotcom, and $170,000 per month for living expenses for the same claimant.Most of the claimants in this case filed their claims together on August 28, and Mona Dotcom filed a spousal claim on September 1, 2014. The claimants also filed a joint waiver of notice. The government subsequently moved to strike all the claimants' claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2466, the federal fugitive disentitlement statute. On February 27, 2015, the district court granted the motion to strike, having allowed claimants to appear and present arguments on the motion but not on the merits of the case. The government then moved for default judgment, which the district court granted on March 25, 2015, issuing forfeiture orders for the assets in New Zealand and Hong Kong.",cybercrime,0
"This case involves seven members of an organized criminal group that used the Domain Name System (DNS) Changer malware with co-conspirators to engage in a fraudulent advertisement scheme.The group posed as a legitimate Internet advertisement agency and entered into Internet advertising agreements where the defendants were paid to receive money each time a user clicked on a website link or advertisement. The defendants used rogue DNS servers and malware to fraudulently increase traffic, in turn increasing their revenue.  The malware would infect users’ systems, alter users’ DNS server settings to route activity to the rogue DNS servers, prevent anti-virus from receiving software updates, and facilitate click hijacking (i.e., where clicking on a search result redirects the user to the perpetrators’ desired site which the perpetrators receive payment for) and click fraud (i.e., fraudulently replacing advertisements on sites with desired advertisements that perpetrators receive payment for). To prevent detection from law enforcement and conceal the source of the proceeds of crime, one of the defendants was suspected of engaging in money-laundering activities by (attempting to) transport the proceeds out of the US.The defendants were charged in a 27-count-indictment in October 2011. Vladimir Tsastsin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit computer intrusion and was sentenced to 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment with one year of supervision after release and was required to forfeit USD 2.5 million.

Specifically, on multiple occasions, the defendant’s co-conspirators, who were in China, gained unauthorized access to systems, retrieved proprietary data, showed the defendant what was accessed, and received guidance from the defendant on what information to obtain from the systems. The defendant also translated the data from English to Chinese. The co-conspirators used various techniques to surreptitiously access systems and networks to evade detection. In 2015, the defendant unsuccessfully fought his extradition to the United States.

"In 2013, and international investigation led US prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to charge 7 individuals with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The defendants ran Liberty Reserve, a digital payment facility, which allegedly laundered more than USD 6 billion in criminal proceeds. Liberty Reserve was shut down by US authorities in May 2013 as a result of the investigation. Liberty Reserve – incorporated in 2006 in Costa Rica – was a centralized digital currency service. It allowed users to deposit physical currency – Euros or US Dollars - by converting it into a digital currency pinned to the value of the physical one. Once deposited the money, users were allowed to transfer it to other users. The only personal information required to register was a name, e-mail address and birthdate. Liberty Reserve charged a small fee for each transaction.According to the investigators, Liberty Reserve was operated do facilitate money-laundering. Its structure and high degree of untraceability provided cybercriminals with a perfectly functioning tool to store and transfer the proceeds of their illegal activities. Before its shut down, the overall number of Liberty Reserve’ users worldwide exceeded on million and over 55 million transactions were conducted through its system. Such transactions included the transfer of proceeds of credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, narcotics trafficking.One of the co-founders of Liberty Reserve, Vladimir Kats, an American citizen, pleaded guilty before the Federal Court of the Southern District of New York on 31 October 2013 to conspiring to commit money laundering, conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, receiving child pornography and marriage fraud.The other co-founder, Arthur Budovsky, a citizen of Costa Rica, was arrested in Spain in May 2013 and extradited to the US in October 2014.The US Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations carried out the investigation.

"On 23 January 2013, the US District Court of the Southern District of New York unsealed three indictments against Nikita Vladimirovich Kuzmin, Deniss Calovskis and Mihai Ionut Paunescu. The defendants were charged with conspiracy in fraud and related activities in connection with computers and access devices for the creation and use of the Gozi virus. The Gozi virus is one of the most harmful computer viruses ever created. It infected at least one million computers worldwide and 40,000 in the US. It caused the theft or loss of tens of millions of dollars. The virus was undetectable by anti-virus software and was able to collect data from infected devices, including personal bank account information, usernames and passwords. The stolen information was then transmitted to servers controlled by the defendants. The defendants used such information to steal funds from victims’ bank accounts. Kuzmin created the Gozi virus in 2005. Calovskis developed a number of features, including an altered webpage of a bank that was used to steal personal information from the victims. Paunescu created a “bulletproof host”, i.e. a system preventing law enforcement authorities from detecting illegal activities. He leased servers from legitimate hosting providers and then sub-leased them to the cybercriminals. He also distributed malware, such as the “Zeus trojan” and the “SpyEye trojan”, and spam.Kuzmin was arrested in the US in November 2010 and pled guilty in May 2011. Calovskis was arrested in Latvia in November 2012. In August 2013, the Latvian government agreed to extradite Calovskis to the US. However, Calovskis appealed the decision to the Europen Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR ruled that the extradition is lawful. However, the ECHR ordered the Latvian government not to extradite Calovskis until its judgment became final.Calovskis was later extradited to the US, where he plead guilty to writing part of the virus, and was sentenced to 21 months of prison.

Stolen credit card data was alledegly sold through Western Express International to people such as Latta, Perez, Roach, and Washington. The purpose of this sale was to use stolen credit card data to make fraudulent purchases on the internet. Additionally, Western Express provided vendors with credit by using digital currencies like Egold and Webmoney, which were unregulated. This allowed vendors to engage in transactions without disclosing their identities.  The appellants were charged with cybercrimes, such as scheming to defraud, money laundering, grand larceny, and enterprise corruption, although the present appeal dealt with the charge of enterprise corruption.

"The case involves illegal bulking email obscene advertising in the US. The defendants started their business in 2003. At the beginning, they operated through a US corporation. Later on, they decided to run their operations from a Mauritian company – using servers located in the Netherlands – in order to avoid compliance with the email communications bill passed in the US in 2003, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (hereinafter, the “CAN-SPAM Act”). The defendants sent email advertisements, including pornographic content. If the recipients clicked on the links contained in the email and subsequently paid a fee, the defendants earned a commission.The defendants used fictitious information in their bulk emails and registration of their domain names. They placed non-existing email addresses in the “From” field in the headers of their emails. They provided false information in the “Contact person” and “Phone number” fields of their domains’ registration.On 25 June 2007, the defendants were convicted on 8 counts from the District Court of Arizona for conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1037(a)(3) through fraud in connection with electronic mail (Count 1), violation of § 1037(a)(3) and (a)(4) through such fraud (Counts 2 and 3), interstate transportation of obscene materials in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1462 (Counts 4 and 5), interstate transportation of obscene materials for sale in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1465 (Counts 6 and 7); conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956 (Count 8), and failure to meet record keeping requirements in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2257 (Count 9).The first three counts regard the offence of “Fraud and related activity in connection with electronic mail” introduced by the CAN-SPAM Act. The defendants were convicted of materially falsifying  header information in multiple commercial electronic mail messages and intentionally initiating the transmission of such messages [§ 1037(a)(3)] and registering, using information that materially falsifies the identity of the actual registrant, for five or more electronic mail accounts or online user accounts or two or more domain names, and intentionally initiating the transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail messages from any combination of such accounts or domain names [§ 1037(a)(4)].The defendants appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals arguing that (i) the district court erred in instructing the jury as to the definition of obscene expression pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1462 and 1465; (ii) the offence of “Fraud and related activity in connection with electronic mail” (18 U.S.C. § 1037) was unconstitutional as it was overly vague; (iii) counts 1-3 were incorrectly labelled as felonies; (iv) the count of conspiracy money laundering is invalid if the preceding appeals are successful since an unlawful activity is a pre-requisite for the money laundering offence; (v) the application of a two-level obstruction of justice enhancement to one of the defendants’ sentence was error.The defendants’ claim that 18 U.S.C. § 1037 was unconstitutional is based on the vagueness doctrine, according to which  “Vague statutes are invalidated for three reasons”: (1) to avoid punishing people for behaviour that they could not have known was illegal; (2) to avoid subjective enforcement of laws based on `arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement' by government officers; and (3) to avoid any chilling effect on the exercise of First Amendment freedoms."" The defendants argued that the terms ""impair,"" ""altered,"" and ""concealed."" used to describe the material falsification were vague. The court rejected the argument.

"On 25 July 2013, the US Department of Justice made public a federal indictment issued by the US District Court of New Jersey charging five individuals with conspiracy in computer hacking, wire fraud and unauthorised computer access. The defendants are Vladimir Drinkman, Russian citizen, Alexandr Kalinin, Russian citizen, Roman Kotov, Russian citizen, Mikhail Rytikov, Ukranian citizen, and Dmitriy Smilianets, Russian citizen. The defendants together with four conspirators allegedly hacked major corporate computer networks and stole more than 160 million credit card numbers in order to sell them. The targeted companies are NASDAQ, 7-Eleven, Carrefour, JCP, Hannaford, Heartland, Wet Seal, Commidea, Dexia, JetBlue, Dow Jones, Euronet, Visa Jordan, Global Payment, Diners Singapore and Ingenicard. According to the US Department of Justice this is the largest data breach scheme ever prosecuted in the US.According to the charging documents, the scheme was articulated in the following phases:Scouting: the defendants and the conspirators identified potential corporate victims by searching their websites and studying their payment processing systems in order to identify vulnerabilities.Illegal access: the defendants and the conspirators of illegally accessed the computer networks of the corporate victims by means of a Structured Query Language (SQL) injection attack, i.e. an attack on databases using the SQL language programming.The malware: after gaining access, the defendants and the conspirators placed a malware in the hacked computer systems allowing them to access such systems at a later date in order to steal credit card information.Concealing the attacks: it was part of the conspiracy that the defendants and the conspirators would use a number of advanced techniques to conceal their attacks. One of the techniques was bullet-proof hosting, i.e. leasing servers that are inaccessible to law enforcement. Another technique was the use of malware able to prevent anti-virus software from detecting the attacks.Sale: after stealing credit card numbers and associated personal information (dumps), the defendants and the conspirators sold them in batches. The end users encoded the dumps onto magnetic strips of a blank plastic cards and used them to withdraw cash illegally from ATMs or make unauthorized purchases.According to the US Department of Justice, as a consequence of the scheme, financial institutions, credit card companies and consumers suffered hundreds of millions in losses.The charges described above are mere allegations that need to be proven in order to consider the defendants guilty.",cybercrime,0
"This case concerns the defendant Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, one of the leaders of a transnational network that facilitated computer intrusions, fraudulent schemes, and money laundering. The defendant was a Nigerian national and resident of the United Arab Emirates at the time of offending.From January 2019 to June 2020, the defendant conspired with multiple other persons to conduct financial transactions into, within, and outside the United States involving property that represented the proceeds of wire fraud. The co-conspirators targeted multiple victims and laundered and/or attempted to launder funds fraudulently obtained, as well as attempted to fraudulently obtain funds, through bank cyber-heists, business email compromise (“BEC”) frauds, and other fraud schemes. In December 2019, the defendant began conspiring with a co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator A”) to defraud a businessperson, who was seeking a lender to invest USD 15,000,000 in a project to build an international school. The defendant began communicating with the businessperson using an alias and promised to assist in opening a bank account in the United States, where the loan could be deposited. The defendant arranged for another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator B”) to open a bank account at Wells Fargo Bank in Canoga Park, California in the name of a Qatari company, and file a fictitious business name statement in order to register a fictitious business entity. Subsequently, the defendant directed a co-conspirator in Nigeria (“Co-conspirator C”) to create a false and fraudulent power of attorney bearing the name of the Qatari company.  The defendant then forwarded the bank information and power of attorney to the businessperson. The defendant and Co-Conspirator A each corresponded with the businessperson to fraudulently induce the businessperson to pay approximately USD 330,000 to fund the opening of a purported “investor’s account” in order to facilitate the transfer of the USD 15,000,000 loan they promised the businessperson. The defendant himself directed the businessperson to make wire transfers of USD 230,000 to the Wells Fargo bank account of a luxury watch-seller and USD 100,000 to a Capital One bank account of another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator D”), which the businessperson did.The defendant used these funds for his personal benefit, and none of the funds were used as promised to the businessperson. The defendant used the wire transfer of USD 230,000 to purchase a luxury Richard Mille RM11-03 watch and arranged for the watch-seller to have the watch available in the New York metropolitan area, where Co-conspirator D picked it up.  Co-conspirator D and another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator E”) arranged to have the watch delivered to a different co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator F”), who was directed by the defendant to transport the watch to the United Arab Emirates in January 2020.The defendant further directed Co-conspirator D to withdraw the USD 100,000 transferred to her and convert a portion of them - minus USD 8,000 as payment for Co-conspirator D – to the Nigerian currency, which she would then send to co-conspirators who would deliver the funds to the defendant using transfers between Nigerian bank accounts. The defendant also arranged to have Co-conspirator D send cashier’s checks of USD 40,000 and USD 10,000 to another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator G”) who would use the funds to obtain St. Christopher (St. Kitts) and Nevis’ citizenship and a passport for the defendant, which he received in February 2020.In January and February 2020, the defendant and Co-conspirator A corresponded with the businessperson, attempting to fraudulently induce the businessperson to pay USD 575,000 in purported “taxes” to release the loan. In February, the businessperson wire transferred approximately USD 300,000 to bank accounts in Kenya.In the beginning of March 2020, the defendant further fraudulently induced the businessperson to send additional wire transfers to U.S. bank accounts, namely USD 100,000 to Co-conspirator D and USD 80,000 to a different co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator H”). The funds from these payments were subsequently laundered through a variety of means, with the assistance of Co-conspirators D, E, G, and H.The defendant later admitted to the following approximate actual or intended loss amounts, foreseeable to him, in connection with the victims identified:- Foreign Financial Institution: approximately USD 14,700,000.00; - Victim Companies in the U.K.: approximately USD 7,740,000.00;  - Victim Law Firm: USD 922,857.76;  - and Victim Businessperson and Qatari Victim Company: USD 809,983.58.The defendant was arrested by U.A.E. law enforcement officials in June 2020. After his expulsion from the U.A.E., FBI special agents obtained custody of Abbas and brought him to the United States to stand trial.In April 2021, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in money laundering. He was sentenced to over eleven years in prison and ordered to pay USD 1,732,841 in restitution to two fraud victims in November 2022.",money laundry,1
"Aaron Michael Shamo ran a drug trafficking organization, of which the other five defendants were members, that imported controlled substances, such as fentanyl and alprazolam, from China and used the narcotics to produce fake oxycodone pills made with fentanyl and counterfeit Xanax tablets, which were subsequently sold on the Darknet marketplace AlphaBay using the vendor name “PHARMA-MASTER”. Shamo, through his organization, sold 1 million fentanyl-laced fake oxycodone pills to buyers in the United States, who were not aware of the falsification. Ultimately, Shamo was charged and convicted for running, organizing, supervising, and directing a continuing criminal enterprise that imported and distributed controlled substances. Likewise, the other five members of the continuing criminal enterprise that were indicted, were also charged with various drug-related offences (such as conspiracy to distribute fentanyl and conspiracy to distribute alprazolam) and/or conspiracy to commit money laundering and all entered plea agreements. Shamo, on the other hand, was ultimately convicted by a jury for“engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, three counts of aiding and abetting the importation of a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, manufacture of a controlled substance, …two counts of knowing and intentional adulteration of drugs while held for sale…[,] aiding and abetting the use of the U.S. mail in furtherance of a drug trafficking offence, conspiracy to commit money laundering, money laundering promotion and concealment, and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity.”For his crimes, Shamo was sentenced to life in prison.",money laundry,1
"This case involves the sentencing of a Russian national who operated two websites facilitating payment card fraud, computer hacking, and other crimes.According to the official documents, the defendant, Aleksei Burkov, operated a website called “Card Planet,” which offered stolen credit card data that had been obtained mostly through computer intrusion. There were hundreds of thousands of victims, many of them U.S. citizens. Over 150,000 stolen credit card numbers from over 1,300 banks were offered for purchase. Regarding cards of U.S. accounts alone, this resulted in over USD 20 million in fraudulent purchases.In addition, the defendant operated another website, which was invite-only, where elite cybercriminals could advertise stolen goods (i.e. personal identification data), malicious software, and criminal services, including money laundering and hacking services. To obtain membership, prospective members needed three existing members to “vouch” for them and pay a sum of money, usually USD 5,000, as insurance. These measures were aimed at avoid detection from law enforcement authorities as well as guaranteeing that their members valued the deals made on the website. To the same end, the forum removed arrested members from the site by banning them to prevent law enforcement agencies from using the arrested member and/or arrested member’s details to access the site.The defendant was arrested at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel, in December 2015. On 4 February 2016, the defendant was charged with conspiring to commit access device fraud (included in two counts), identity theft, computer intrusion, wire fraud (included in two counts), and money laundering, as well as with access device fraud and wire fraud in a superseding indictment. In 2017, an Israeli district court approved the extradition of the defendant to the United States. After the denial of the defendant’s appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli High Court of Justice, the defendant was finally extradited on 11 November 2019. On 23 January 2020, The defendant pleaded guilty to one count of access device fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, identity theft, computer intrusions, wire fraud, and money laundering on 23 January 2020.

"The organized criminal group involved in this case perpetrated several cybercrimes, one of which was online auction fraud. According to the indictment, this fraud was perpetrated by members of the group by posting “hundreds or thousands of listings for automobiles, motorcycles, and other high-priced goods on eBay and similar auction sites.” The images of the items being sold that were included in these postings were infected with malware (i.e., the Bayrob Trojan). When individuals clicked on the images of the items, their devices were infected with the malware, which was designed to redirect these individuals to webpages that looked identical to the legitimate websites of the auction sites. For example, their fake eBay pages included the trademark of the organization and had a similar layout, design, and style of the legitimate eBay webpages with an important key difference. The fake eBay webpages prompted users to pay for the auctioned items using something called an “eBay escrow agent,” which does not exist on the legitimate platform. This purported service claimed to hold the money of the buyer in escrow until the item was received and the buyer was satisfied with the condition of the item delivered before the buyer’s funds were released to the seller. The webpages also included a live chat function that supposedly enabled individuals to speak with customer service agents of eBay; of course, these were not real eBay customer service agents, they were members of the group. The victims of this online auction fraud never received the items they paid for and never received a refund for the money they paid for the non-delivered items.One of the defendants (T.D.) pled guilty to aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy offences relating to wire fraud and money laundering, and received 10 years imprisonment for his crimes. B.N. and R.M. were charged, convicted, and sentenced to 20 and 18 years’ imprisonment, respectively, for aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy offences relating to wire fraud and money laundering, as well as conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit service marks.",money laundry,1
"Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator Brandon Arias used the moniker “The Drug Llama” on a vendor account on Dream Market (a Darknet site) to sell counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl. Melissa Scanlan was responsible for sourcing the drugs that would be sold using via the vendor account, while Brandon Arias was responsible for receiving and fulfilling Darknet drug orders, as well as the management of the account. Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator received fentanyl and other narcotics from Mexico, predominantly from Fausto Ramirez and another (unnamed) member of the Mexican cartel. After Melissa Scanlan and Brandon Arias sold the drugs, they kept a portion of the proceeds and gave the remaining criminal proceeds to couriers (usually Norma Dominguez and April Kelly, both females). The couriers would transport the proceeds across U.S.-Mexican border and deliver them to Fausto Ramirez and another member of a Mexican cartel. In one year alone, an estimated 52,000 counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl pills were sold.Melissa Scanlan was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, misbranding of drugs, international money laundering conspiracy, and distribution of fentanyl resulting in death.

"This case involves Gary Davis, a member of the small administrative “staff” of the Darknet marketplace “Silk Road.” During its operation from 2011 until 2013, Silk Road was used to distribute illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to more than 100,000 buyers, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of proceeds of these illicit transactions.From June to 2 October 2013, Davis, also known under his alias “Libertas,” worked as a site administrator on Silk Road. He was responsible for responding to customer support requests regarding the need for assistance with buyer or seller accounts, serving as an arbitrator by resolving disputes between drug dealers and their customers, and enforcing the rules for doing business on Silk Road, such as the rule against out of escrow sales. Davis was paid a weekly salary for his administrative services on the marketplace.Shortly after law enforcement authorities had shut down Silk Road in October 2013, its virtually identical successor, Silk Road 2.0, emerged. Davis also served as an administrator for the successor website from November to December 2013.The defendant, along with two of his co-conspirators, was charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy on 19 December 2013. Davis was arrested in Ireland in January 2014 and extradited to the United States in July 2018. Davis pleaded guilty to narcotics trafficking conspiracy on 5 October 2018 and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release on 25 July 2019. He was further ordered to forfeit USD 25,000. At the time of writing, no official information is available on the convictions of his co-defendants, Andrew Michael Jones and Peter Phillip Nash.",money laundry,1
"The defendant, Mr Gary Davis (aka “Libertas”) worked for the Silk Road website from June 2013 until 2 October 2013 (when the website was shutdown).Silk Road was an online black market created by Mr Ross Ulbricht where a wide range of illegal goods and services could be bought and sold. The platform resembled other online market places in that it required a username and password to log in, offered users a “shopping cart”, and had other like features). A variety of illicit drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy, and opioids were available for purchase on the website. The drugs purchased on Silk Road caused real harm—drugs purchased on Silk Road resulted in six deaths for overdose (though there is no suggestion that Mr Davis was responsible for any of these deaths). Counterfeit and fraudulent identity documents were also available for sale on the website—including, for instance, counterfeit US and foreign passports, US and foreign drivers’ licenses, and social security cards. Computer hacking tools and services were also available for purchase on Silk Road, including password hacking tools and services, Remote Access Tools (RAT) which allows users to obtain unauthorised remote access to a compromised computer, keyloggers which permit a user to monitor keystrokes inputted by a victim into his or her computer and used to steal confidential information, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) services which disable websites or other publicly available services on the Internet by using large networks of compromised computers to flood victim systems with malicious internet traffic. Finally, Silk Road offered money laundering services to its users, many of which were directly marketed to vendors who sold goods or services on the website. Money laundering services aimed at converting proceeds of illegal transactions (obtained in Bitcoin, the required means of payment on the Silk Road website) into other forms of currency. Vendors in this category offered, among other things, the sale of US currency, anonymous debit cards preloaded with currency and other prepaid payment systems, such as Moneypak cards.Silk Road was only accessible through the Tor network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed round the work and designed to conceal the true IP of the computers on the network and, thereby, the identities of users.The required and only payment system on Silk Road was Bitcoin—an entirely electronic currency, not issued by any bank or state, generated and controlled automatically through computer software operating on a peer-to-peer network, and operated through blockchain stored on the peer-to-peer network. On Silk Road, every user had one (or more) Silk Road Bitcoin address associated with their own Silk Road account. The Bitcoin address could be used by each user to deposit funds into their Silk Road account. These addresses were stored on “wallet” files maintained on computer servers controlled by Mr Ulbricht. To make purchases on the website, therefore, a user had to first obtain Bitcoin (for example, from a Bitcoin exchanger) and send these to a Bitcoin address associated with the user’s Silk Road account. Once the purchase took place, the funds were debited from the user’s Silk Road account and held in escrow in a wallet file maintained by Silk Road pending completion of the transaction. Once the transaction was completed the vendor’s Silk Road account would be credited with the payment minus the commission Silk Road took on the sale (8–15% of the transaction). The vendor would then withdraw the Bitcoins from his Silk Road account by transferring them to an outside Bitcoin address, such as the address of a Bitcoin exchanger who would cash out the Bitcoins for real currency. The vendors would also convert their Bitcoins into other currencies, by using money laundering services offered on the website.Silk Road would also use a so-called “tumbler” to hinder the tracking of individual transactions through the blockchain. In a nutshell, the “tumbler” would obscure any link between both the buyer’s and the vendor’s Bitcoin addresses. It would, therefore, make the use of blockchain to follow the money trail useless, even if both the vendor’s and buyer’s Bitcoin addresses were known.Mr Ulbricht ran the website with some support staff (they were four when Silk Road was shutdown by law enforcement on 2 October 2013), who were divided into forum moderators and site administrators. Forum moderators were responsible for, among other things, monitoring user activity on discussion forums associated with the site, providing guidance to forum users concerning how to conduct business on Silk Road, and reporting any significant problems discussed on the forums to the site administrators and Mr Ulbricht. Site administrators were in charge of responding to customer support requests from Silk Road users who needed assistance with their buyer or seller accounts; investigating disputes that arose between vendors and buyers, including reporting their findings to Mr Andrew Michael Jones (another site administrator) or Mr Ulbricht; and helping enforce the rules for doing business on Silk Road. This last responsibility included demoting vendors or referring them to Mr Ulbricht for further discipline. This could happen when vendors and buyers would communicate on Silk Road and decide to conclude the sale offsite to avoid paying to Silk Road a commission (this was called “out of escrow” sales).Mr Gary Davis first worked for a month as a forum moderator of Silk Road. He then was “promoted” to site administrator. As a site administrator, he demoted an account that was likely compromised by the police and posted some posts on the forum advising users how to conceal their true identities. When Silk Road was shut down by law enforcement on 2 October 2013, Mr Davis helped with the launch of “Silk Road 2.0”, a website which was created in the month following Silk Road’s demise. Mr Davis used his credibility with the original Silk Road community to vouch for the new website. He worked on the new version of Silk Road as a site administrator for one month, until he was arrested in Ireland in January 2014.Mr Davis was extradited from Ireland to the US in July 2018. He pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to traffic a controlled substance (narcotics). He was sentenced to six years and six months’ imprisonment on 25 July 2019.",money laundry,1
"The defendant, Joaquin Archivaldo Guzman Loera, also known as ""El Chapo"", was, since 1994, a leader of the Sinaloa Cartel alongside Ismael Zambada Garcia. The Sinaloa Cartel was one of the most powerful drug trafficking organisations in Mexico.Guzman transported illicit drugs with the use of fishing boats, submarines, carbon fibre airplanes, trains with secret compartments and underground tunnels. Once the narcotics were in the United States, they were sold to wholesale distributors. Guzman then used various methods to launder billions of dollars of drug proceeds, including US-based insurance companies, reloadable debit cards, numerous shell companies, including a juice company and a fish flour company, and the smuggling cash in bulk from the United States to Mexico.Guzman was arrested in 2016 in Mexico and was extradited in 2017 to the US where he was convicted of continuing criminal enterprise; possession, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances; use of firearms; and laundering of monetary instruments and sentenced to life imprisonment on 17 July 2019.",money laundry,1
"This case involved a sextortion scheme perpetrated by inmates in the South Carolina Department of Corrections, as well as co-conspirators outside of the prison, against U.S. military personnel. In this sextortion scheme, the inmates, using smartphones they smuggled into the prison, signed up for dating apps and targeted U.S. military members utilizing these apps. The defendants and co-conspirators created fake profiles of women using images that they found online. After contacting the targets and obtaining personal information from them, the inmates would send naked images of the person they were impersonating (images which were also found online) and request that the targets provide nude images. The inmates would then call the targets impersonating the father of the person the targets were in contact with (i.e., the women in the profile). The inmates would proceed to misinform the targets that they were communicating with a minor and that what the targets had in their possession (i.e., the naked image) was considered child sexual abuse material. The inmates would then threaten to contact the authorities and report the individuals if money was not paid to the “victim”. The targets were directed to pay these fees using wire transfers via Western Union, MoneyGram, Walmart, and PayPal. The inmates recruited money mules, who received the wire transfers from the military members and would then send the funds to the inmates as directed.The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, extortion, and money laundering. Several of the defendants pled guilty. Specifically, Tiffany Reed pled guilty and was sentenced to three years’ probation for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Another defendant, Wendell Wilkins, also pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, but has yet to be sentenced. Jalisa Thompson, Brandon Thompson pled guilty to money laundering and were sentenced to time served and 15 months’ imprisonment, respectively.

"This case involves a transnational criminal organization (called the “Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network” by U.S. authorities in the criminal indictment) which perpetrated online auction fraud (i.e., advertising and selling non-existent items) against U.S. victims on eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, and AutoTrader.com. The organization primarily operated in Alexandria, Romania, with some operations taking place in other areas of Eastern Europe, as well as the United States. The victims of the online auction fraud paid for the fake items with “reloadable prepaid cards, prepaid debit cards, and gift cards of varying types (collectively referred to herein as ‘prepaid debit cards’), including Green Dot Moneypaks, Visa One Vanilla prepaid debit cards, PayPal My Cash cards, and Amazon gift cards; United States postal money orders; cashier’s checks; MoneyGram and Western Union wires; and bank wires and deposits.”The Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network worked with others to launder criminal proceeds, by taking the money paid by victims for the fake items sold online, converting the money to Bitcoin, transferring the Bitcoin to members and associates in Eastern Europe, and using Bitcoin exchanges to convert the Bitcoin to fiat currency. Associates of the organizations in the United States, such as J.A.V., obtained victim payments, converted them to Bitcoins, and sent the Bitcoins to members of the organization who had perpetrated the online auction fraud. Third-party money launderers in the U.S. (i.e., A.E.N., D.A.B., and R.W.D.L.T) were also used to collect, redeem, and convert victim payment into cash or Bitcoins. Additionally, two Bitcoin exchangers were used by the Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network.

"In 2001, Manitoba, Canada-based Kristjan Thorkelson founded Canada Drugs as an online pharmacy based in Winnipeg, Canada. Canada Drug’s business model was based on illegally importing unapproved and misbranded prescription pharmaceutical drugs into the United States from abroad and selling the drugs illegally to consumers throughout the United States.The drugs were illegally imported into the United States through the systematic use of fraudulent customs declaration forms, which consistently undervalued the price of the drug products in order to avoid detection by United States regulatory and law enforcement authorities. The role of Thorkelson was the Chief Executive Officer of Canada Drugs and, with other co-conspirators, he distributed within the United States substantial quantities of prescription drugs, including clinical cancer medications that were not approved by the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA).After approximately eight years of operating this illegal scheme, in 2009, Canada Drugs’ market was expanded to include acquiring prescription drugs, including life-saving cancer medication, intended for sale in foreign countries and illegally smuggling the drugs into the United States for distribution. As part of this expansion, Canada Drugs acquired other companies engaged in similar illegal prescription drug importation and distribution activities and used the brand names, drug inventories, and customer lists of those companies to further its illegal operation.CANADA DRUGS conducted its clinical sales through several subsidiaries, including Rockley Ventures, Global Drug Supply and RIVER EAST which operated in United States, Canada, Barbados and United Kingdom. During the criminal investigation, it was discovered that entities affiliated with Canada Drugs had distributed in the United States counterfeit cancer drug Avastin (American version) and counterfeit cancer drug Altuzan (Turkish version). FDA Office of Criminal Investigation agents learned that executives and employees of Canada Drugs had systematically undervalued the declared value of each shipment of pharmaceutical drugs on customs forms in order to conceal the illegal importation of the unapproved and misbranded drugs into United States.It was in approximately 2009, CANADA DRUGS began selling unapproved and misbranded prescription drugs directly to physicians and physician office practices in the United States. When Canada Drugs discovered that there had been a significant breach in its supply chain and it might be distributed counterfeit Avastin to physicians in the United States, they made no attempt to notify FDA or any other authorities.The counterfeit Avastin distributed by Canada Drugs-affiliated entities was discovered in December 2011, when the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcase Products Regulatory Agency notified the FDA of a potential counterfeit batch of oncology drug which River East Supplies had purchased from a supplier in the European Union.From 2009 until 2012, CANADA DRUGS profited heavily from its criminal enterprise. During that time, CANADA DRUGS generated at least $78 million in gross proceeds from the illegal sale of unapproved new drugs, misbranded drugs and counterfeit drugs in the United States. Furthermore, CANADA DRUGS systematically moved its proceeds from accounts in the United States to accounts in Barbados, and then ultimately transferred the profits to accounts in Canada.In total, CANADA DRUGS facilitated the transfer of at least $78,184,482 in gross proceeds from its illegal enterprise into bank accounts held by ROCKLEY VENTURES in Barbados.The Defendants involved were the legal persons CANDADRUGS.COM, Rockley Ventures, Global Drug Supply, River East Supplies and the individuals Kristjan Thorkelson, Thomas Haughton, Ronald Sigurdson, Narinder Kaulder, Troy Nakamura, Darren Chalus.They were convicted for: -       Conspiracy to Smuggle Goods into the United States.-       Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering.-       International Money LaunderingAs the direct result of the illegal conduct of Thorkelson, consumers and patients, including those needing life-saving chemotheraphy, were at risk of receiving drugs that were not approved by the FDA for use in the United States.It was in December 2017 when the defendant, K.T. agreed to plead guilty to the superseding information, which charges the crime of Misprision of Felony.  The United States and Thorkelson jointly request that the Court accept Thorkelson’s plea and plea agreement, and impose a sentence of 60 months probation, the first 6 months to be served under home detention, a fine in the amount of$250,000, a special assessment of $100, and additional conditions of probation, which include causing the permanent cessation of the sale of all unapproved, misbranded, adulterated, or counterfeit drugs in the United States and cooperating fully with the United States in this ongoing and future criminal prescription drug investigations.",money laundry,1

"This case involves several cyber and organized crime related offences of the creator of Silk Road, a massive online marketplace which sold illicit goods and services, in particular drugs. The defendant, Ross William Ulbricht, created Silk Road in January 2011, and owned and operated the website until it was shut down by law enforcement authorities in October 2013.The defendant deliberately operated Silk Road as an online criminal marketplace with the intent to facilitate its users to buy and sell illegal goods and services anonymously and under the radar of law enforcement. The defendant aimed at anonymizing transactions on Silk Road by operating Silk Road on “The Onion Router,” or “Tor” network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed around the world, designed to conceal the true IP addresses, and hence identities of its users; and by including a Bitcoin-based payment system that concealed the identities and locations of the users.The defendant controlled and oversaw every aspect of Silk Road, and managed a staff of paid, online administrators and computer programmers who assisted with the day-to-day operation of the site.  The defendant reaped commissions worth over USD 13 million generated from the illicit sales conducted through the site.The U.S. government learned of Silk Road in 2011, after intercepting a drug package in Chicago's O'Hare airport, and commenced an investigation into the online marketplace. Agents discovered that the Silk Road was run and managed by someone with the screen name of “Dread Pirate Roberts” (D.P.R.). In 2012, law enforcement agents investigated several individuals believed to be “Dread Pirate Roberts,” including Ross Ulbricht, Anand Athavale, and Mark Karpeles. Ultimately, Ulbricht became the primary suspect in 2013 after a series of “pen/trap” orders, which led U.S. law enforcement agents to collect evidence in the form of I.P. address data from Ulbricht’s home wireless network. Additional evidence came from undercover investigations, in which law enforcement agents took over low-level Silk Road administrators’ accounts and interacted with D.P.R. online, in an attempt to expose Ulbricht. In October 2013, at the San Francisco public library, agents arrested Ulbricht after catching him while he was logged in as the administrator of Silk Road and its D.P.R.The defendant was charged with and convicted of distributing narcotics, distributing narcotics by means of the Internet, conspiring to distribute narcotics, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit computer hacking, conspiring to traffic in false identity documents, and conspiring to commit money laundering. He was further accused of soliciting six murders-for-hire in connection with operating the site, although there was no evidence that these murders were actually carried out.",money laundry,1
"On January 5, 2012, a grand jury returned an indictment against many of the claimants in this action, charging them with criminal copyright infringement and money laundering ""with estimated harm to copyright holders well in excess of $500,000,000 and reported income in excess of $175,000,000."" The claimants' alleged copyright infringement scheme, dubbed the ""Mega Conspiracy,"" used public websites to facilitate the illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted movies, software, television programs, and music. The government estimates that the alleged criminal conduct has caused billions of dollars in harm to the copyright holders.Following the indictment, the district court issued restraining orders for assets in New Zealand and Hong Kong where most of the remaining identified proceeds resided. The High Court in Hong Kong responded almost immediately by issuing a restraining order against approximately $60 million in assets, while New Zealand first arrested several of the now-claimants, released them on bail, and then several months later, in April, registered restraining orders on $15 million in assets. New Zealand also scheduled extradition hearings for August 2012, but these hearings have been continued at least eight times at the claimants' request.The New Zealand restraining orders could only remain registered for two years, after which they could be extended for up to one year. Recognizing that the restraints would run out on April 18, 2014, or if extended on April 18, 2015, the United States filed this civil forfeiture action against forty-eight assets restrained pursuant to the criminal indictment in the district court on July 29, 2014. Although restraining orders froze the assets in the lead up to this action, the New Zealand courts have routinely released funds to claimants for living and legal expenses. Some of these have been very substantial, including millions in legal fees for Kim Dotcom, and $170,000 per month for living expenses for the same claimant.Most of the claimants in this case filed their claims together on August 28, and Mona Dotcom filed a spousal claim on September 1, 2014. The claimants also filed a joint waiver of notice. The government subsequently moved to strike all the claimants' claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2466, the federal fugitive disentitlement statute. On February 27, 2015, the district court granted the motion to strike, having allowed claimants to appear and present arguments on the motion but not on the merits of the case. The government then moved for default judgment, which the district court granted on March 25, 2015, issuing forfeiture orders for the assets in New Zealand and Hong Kong.",money laundry,0
"This case involves seven members of an organized criminal group that used the Domain Name System (DNS) Changer malware with co-conspirators to engage in a fraudulent advertisement scheme.The group posed as a legitimate Internet advertisement agency and entered into Internet advertising agreements where the defendants were paid to receive money each time a user clicked on a website link or advertisement. The defendants used rogue DNS servers and malware to fraudulently increase traffic, in turn increasing their revenue.  The malware would infect users’ systems, alter users’ DNS server settings to route activity to the rogue DNS servers, prevent anti-virus from receiving software updates, and facilitate click hijacking (i.e., where clicking on a search result redirects the user to the perpetrators’ desired site which the perpetrators receive payment for) and click fraud (i.e., fraudulently replacing advertisements on sites with desired advertisements that perpetrators receive payment for). To prevent detection from law enforcement and conceal the source of the proceeds of crime, one of the defendants was suspected of engaging in money-laundering activities by (attempting to) transport the proceeds out of the US.The defendants were charged in a 27-count-indictment in October 2011.

"The FBI’s Seattle Division conducted a joint investigation with the FBI Legal Attaché office in Bucharest, Romania and the Romanian Directiei Nationale Anticoruptie (DNA) involving the Nemes and their associates. The United States claims the Nemes were involved in a tax fraud scheme to avoid paying Romania 53 million Euro in excise taxes on imported diesel fuel. Their complaint alleges that the Nemes laundered the proceeds out of Romania, through multiple foreign accounts, and into the United States, where they ultimately purchased the properties at issue. When the scheme was discovered, the Nemes were extradited to Romania, where they were indicted for tax evasion and setting up an organized criminal group. The offenses are punishable up to eight and five years, respectively, not counting aggravating circumstances. The United States commenced this action to forfeit the real property the Nemes left behind, claiming it was used to conceal money laundering, international money laundering, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. These activities support forfeiture under this country’s criminal code. See 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(A). The United States initially relied on a different, bilateral treaty to justify this action. The Nemes filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the complaint was improperly based on the allegation that she had committed an offense extraditable under a bilateral treaty between the United States and Romania. She argued that only multilateral treaty offenses give rise to forfeiture. This Court agreed, but, because the defect was curable, granted the United States leave to amend. The United States filed an amended forfeiture complaint relying instead on UNTOC—a multilateral treaty. Nemes argues that forfeiture statutes must be strictly construed against the government, and that the money laundering statute upon which the United States relies does not apply to foreign tax evasion offenses. She claims that UNTOC applies only to “transnational” offenses— crimes committed in or affecting more than one State—and that none of the crimes Romania charged her with are transnational in nature.As explained in detail under the legal reasoning section, the court deemed tax evasion a serious crime worthy of extradition under UNTOC. Furthermore, it deemed the criminal activities of international money laundering as transnational in nature further saying that 'The fact that Nemes was not actually charged with money laundering in Romania is not the end of the inquiry. A criminal conviction is not required to proceed with a statutory in rem forfeiture.'Lastly, it ruled that the alleged crimes of setting up an organized criminal group and money laundering are both extraditable under UNTOC. The motion to dismiss was thus denied.",money laundry,0

"In 1995, the defendant Irit Gutman founded, alongside Iyla Lubenskiy, Egra Medical Transportation (Egra), a company that offered transportation services for patients requiring assistance in attending their medical appointments. One of Egra’s customers was the Illinois Medical Assistance Program, which sought to pay for low-income patients’ medical services. Various types or categories of services paid at varying rates were commonly requested by the Program. After accidentally receiving an incorrect service code from the Program, the defendant, with the aim of increasing their revenue, began to overbill the Program by either changing the category of service (for example, a non-handicapped person would appear on the bill as handicapped), altering the destination or increasing the number of miles.On 1 December 1999, the defendant and her co-owner entered into an agreement with the federal government in which they would be permanently barred from participating in the Program.However, the defendant and her co-owner later reformed the company as Universal Transportation Company (UPT), which commenced business on 16 January 2001. To circumvent their ban from participating in the program, the pair brought in a third person, Mike Tishel, to appear as the sole owner of UPT. Under the new arrangement, the defendant and Lubenskiy still ran the company. The business operated as it always had, with the same drivers, vehicles, employees and office space, and continued to submit false billings and overbill for mileage.Tishel and his son were the only authorised signatories on the UPT account, into which the State of Illinois’ checks were deposited. Tishel would then transfer the funds to his personal account from which they were later moved to the defendant’s personal account. The defendant used the funds to purchase single family homes in her own name, at least one of which was transferred to her son. According to Lubenskiy’s testimony, this was done to hide the property. Additionally, Lubenskiy and Gutman used the funds to purchase expensive cars in their own name. Between 16 January 2001, and February 2002, UPT billed the State of Illinois approximately USD 6 million, of which it received approximately USD 3 million.On January 20, 2004, the defendant, Mike Tishel, Ilya Lubenskiy, and UPT were each charged with vendor fraud, theft, and money laundering.",money laundry,1

The superseding indictment of this case, which was filed on 29 March 2021, regards the exploitation and abuse of four girls aged between 14 and 17.In the time period stated above, the defendant had a personal and professional relationship with the co-conspirator, which included being paid by Epstein to manage his various properties throughout the whole time frame as well as an intimate relationship from 1994 until 1997.Beginning in at least 1994, the defendant became involved in the sexual exploitation and abuse of minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein according to the superseding indictment. The defendant befriended some of Epstein’s minor victims prior to their abuse and conducted friendly conversations with the victims concerning their personal lives, their families and their school lives. The defendant and her co-conspirators would further spend time taking victims shopping or to the movies, either together or each on their own with the victims. Subsequently, the defendant and her co-conspirator would attempt to normalize sexual abuse, inter alia, by discussing sexual topics, undressing in front of the victims or being present while they undressed. The defendant would also sometimes be present for sex acts involving her co-conspirator and a victim, which would put the victim at ease since she was an adult woman. In some instances, she would further encourage victims to provide (sexualized) massages to her co-conspirator. Additionally, the defendant would encourage victims to accept assistance offered by Epstein to pay for travel and/or educational opportunities, which would make victims feel indebted to the defendant and her co-conspirator. This all happened at multiple locations, including a multi-story private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, USA, an estate in Palm Beach, Florida, USA, a ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, all owned by Epstein, and the defendant’s private residence in London, UK.According to the superseding indictment, at least one victim was encouraged by the defendant and Epstein to travel to New York for the purpose of Epstein abusing her in 1996. Moreover, the defendant and her co-conspirator additionally encouraged minor girls to visit Epstein’s Palm Beach residence to engage in sex acts with Epstein for which would later be paid hundreds of USD at least in or about 2001.The defendant and her co-conspirator would encourage at least one of the victims to travel with Epstein with the intention that the victim engage in sex acts with him. As stated in the superseding indictment, they further paid certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. Likewise, between in or about 2001 until in or about 2004, the defendant and Epstein encouraged at least one minor to engage in sex acts with Epstein according to the superseding indictment. For that purpose, employees of Epstein, including the defendant, would call victims to make an appointment to massage Epstein at his residence in Palm Beach. When a victim arrived there, she would be greeted by one of the employees, including the defendant. The victim would be escorted into a room with a massage table to provide massages to Epstein, during which he would escalate the situation. The sexual acts undertaken by Epstein and his victims included, among other things, touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. Afterwards, employees or associates of Epstein, including the defendant, paid the victim in cash.Furthermore, the defendant allegedly repeatedly made false statements, including statements regarding certain specific acts and events alleged in the indictment, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding in 2016.The defendant was arrested in New Hampshire, USA, on 2 July 2020 and initially charged with charged with enticing a minor to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. On 29 March 2021, a superseding indictment was filed, adding the charges of sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy thereof. The perjury charges were later severed and the defendant was found guilty of five of the six charges on 29 December 2021. It should be noted that, at the time of writing, only a decision in the first instance had been reached and that the defendant’s attorney had publicly mentioned her plan to appeal the verdict. Therefore, this summary might not reflect the final verdict in this case.The co-conspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, was also charged with sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking in relation to this conduct but was found dead in his jail cell on 10 August 2019. Subsequently, the charges against him were dismissed and the investigation focussed on his associates and employees.",other crimes,0
"This case involved a sextortion scheme perpetrated by inmates in the South Carolina Department of Corrections, as well as co-conspirators outside of the prison, against U.S. military personnel. In this sextortion scheme, the inmates, using smartphones they smuggled into the prison, signed up for dating apps and targeted U.S. military members utilizing these apps. The defendants and co-conspirators created fake profiles of women using images that they found online. After contacting the targets and obtaining personal information from them, the inmates would send naked images of the person they were impersonating (images which were also found online) and request that the targets provide nude images. The inmates would then call the targets impersonating the father of the person the targets were in contact with (i.e., the women in the profile). The inmates would proceed to misinform the targets that they were communicating with a minor and that what the targets had in their possession (i.e., the naked image) was considered child sexual abuse material. The inmates would then threaten to contact the authorities and report the individuals if money was not paid to the “victim”. The targets were directed to pay these fees using wire transfers via Western Union, MoneyGram, Walmart, and PayPal. The inmates recruited money mules, who received the wire transfers from the military members and would then send the funds to the inmates as directed.The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, extortion, and money laundering.

Petitioner and her associates would recruit alien “customers” in China, obtain false travel documents for them, transport them to the United States along dangerous routes and in inhumane conditions, and then hold them hostage in the United States until their smuggling fees were paid. The operation began in the early 1980s, when petitioner would smuggle villagers from China’s Fujian Province into the United States in exchange for thousands of dollars. By the early 1990s, petitioner was smuggling thousands of illegal aliens into the United States, often hundreds at a time on cargo ships. Petitioner operated her business out of a small storefront in Chinatown in New York City. From there, petitioner also operated a money-transmitting business through which she laundered smuggling proceeds for herself and other alien smugglers and trafficked in ransom money. Petitioner had “employees” in China, Thailand, Hong Kong, Guatemala, Mexico, and Kenya, among other countries. Petitioner also enlisted the help of the Fuk Ching Gang, a violent criminal enterprise responsible for murders, robberies, and other crimes. Gang members offloaded aliens from arriving cargo ships. On one occasion in 1993, the gang members failed to meet a cargo ship (the Golden Venture) on which petitioner and other alien smugglers had transported a group of aliens to New York. At the smugglers’ instruction, the captain ran the ship aground and instructed the passengers to wade or swim to shore. Dozens of aliens did so, and ten of them drowned. On another occasion in approximately 1998, 14 aliens being smuggled by petitioner drowned off the coast of Guatemala.Cheng Chui Ping, aka Sister Ping, one of the most successful human smugglers, was sentenced on March 16, 2006, to 35 years prison.

While serving as a Government official he required business owners to pay him 50% of their profits by threatening to use his power to harm their business if not paid. One businessman who yielded to Lazarenko’s demands was Kiritchenko, who subsequently found the relationship advantageous and entered into other business transactions with Lazarenko.Lazarenko’s influential positions allowed him to extort millions from various businesses. To transfer money out of the Ukraine, Lazarenko caused Dutch and other firms to pay funds to banks in Hungary, Poland, Switzerland and Antigua, from which the money was transferred to the United States. The principal destinations of these funds were EuroFed accounts in the Bank of America in San Francisco.As a result of inquiries from the Ukraine in connection with an investigation of corruption, the American FBI began an inquiry into the financial activities of Kiritchenko, who had relocated to San Francisco in the mid-1990s. This led to evidence suggesting money laundering. In 1998 Swiss authorities charged former P.M. Lazarenko with money laundering in connection with funds routed through Switzerland. Evidence concerning the overlapping Ukrainian, Swiss and US investigations was exchanged informally among police and prosecution authorities.

"From approximately 1990 to April 2008, Evelyn Sineneng-Smith (Respondent) owned and operated an immigration consulting firm in San Jose, California, with additional branches in Beverly Hills, California, Las Vegas, Nevada, and New York, New York.Sineneng-Smith assisted mostly Filipino immigrants who worked unlawfully in the U.S. home healthcare industry, and who sought lawful permanent resident status. She aided clients with their applications for a Labor Certification which provided undocumented immigrants with a pathway to legal residency.On April 30, 2001, the Labor Certification process expired, and undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. after December 21, 2000 were ineligible to receive permanent residence through this channel.Respondent was aware that the irregular migrants had already missed the statutory application-filing deadline. Regardless, Respondent continued to sign new retainer agreements and to advise her clients that she could help them obtain legal residency through the Labor Certification Process.Respondent charged each migrant listed below over $6,000. Ultimately, Respondent earned more than $3.3 million by deceiving undocumented immigrants into believing that their residency in the U.S. would eventually be legitimized.At least two of Respondent’s clients testified that they would have left the U.S. if Respondent had informed them that they could not obtain legal residence trough this program.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The defendants in this case, along with a third person, worked for the leader of an organized criminal group based in Turbo, Antioquia, Colombia, which was involved in smuggling migrants from late 2014 through to September 2016. Among the migrants smuggled by this group were several Cuban nationals who, between 2015 and 2016, were put into contact with the organizer who then met the potential clients in Venezuela or Ecuador, showed the photos on social media of Cubans previously smuggled successfully, and then received USD 500 to organize boats to bring the migrants to Panama. In September 2016, he also offered two Cuban nationals in Colombia to taken them to Panama across the land border. Family of these women based in Florida then paid USD 1900 to a designated person to enable the women to travel to the United States.  The pair plus one further migrant were met by the defendants and the leader of the group and on 6 September 2016, placed on a boat, believing they would be taken to the United States.  The boat took on water and they had to return to Colombia where a second boat was sourced.  The boat then travelled towards Panama, but ultimately went into a canal area where suddenly the defendant produced a firearm and a knife on the victims.  Two of the migrants (both male) were tied up and thrown overboard; the female migrant was raped and murdered.  The two male migrants were then pulled back into vessel, one was killed, but the other on was able to vanish and after some time, the defendants ceased searching for him.  This migrant was able to swim to shore and on 8 September 2016 reach a fishing village where he was rescued by the Colombian Navy. The victim was able to direct Colombian authorities to the scene of the murders where the bodies of the two other victims were found with the throats and bellies cut open.  The surviving victim later recognized the defendants and the organizer of the group on photographs shown to him by Colombian police.  The two defendants were arrested in Turbo on 10 September and were found in possession of belongings owned by the victims.  Police later also found electronic records of communication between other Cuban migrants and the organizer. The two defendants were charged by Colombian prosecutors with rape, murder, and robbery on 16 September 2016.  The defendants pled guilty on 2 August 2017 and were sentenced to 527 months in prison on 21 September 2017.Family members in Florida also made reports to US authorities leading to an indictment for smuggling of migrants in the US District Court, Southern District of Florida on 16 January 2017.

"The defendant in this Case in front of the United States District Court of Columbia, led the largest Pakistani migrant smuggling operation at the time of the life of the conspiracy. Throughout his 2-year prolonged criminal activity, the defendant has procured the illegal entry of between twenty-five to ninety-nine smuggled migrants. The journey of the migrants began in Pakistan, continued through Central America with the final destination being the United States of America. In March 2014, Agents of the United States Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement “ICE” were informed of the ongoing migrant smuggling operation into the United States. In July 2015, Agents of the “ICE” were tasked with this operation and conducted interviews with smuggled migrants who identified the defendant as their smuggler. Based on extensive information gained through the interviews with the smuggled migrants and complemented by other sources, the US gathered sufficient evidence for extradition of the defendant to the States to stand trial at the US District Court of Columbia.The evidence submitted by the US government suggests that the defendant abused the migrants' vulnerable position by taking away their passport upon arrival in a safe house in Brazil. From that moment on, the defendant restricted migrants' ability to move, and the defendant completely controlled their movement throughout the journey.Additionally, the evidence suggests that the majority of the migrants smuggled by the defendant were in an economically deprived situation due to spending most, if not all, of their savings for paying a 'handsome' price for the defendant's smuggling service. The Court emphasizes that despite the large sum of money the defendant asked for each smuggled migrant to pay, which was between 3.000-15.000$ per individual, the smuggled migrants endured months of life-threatening, uncertain travel throughout Central America by land, air and sea. The average journey of a migrant smuggled by the defendant took up to 9 months. The Case discusses that on their crossing to the States, the smuggled migrants, with their genders undisclosed by the Court, were forced to spend days in crowded boats while crossing through Columbia. Throughout the migrants' journeys through Central American countries and their stays in safe-houses in El Salvador, Panama, Guatemala, Argentina and several other countries - the smuggled migrants continuously spent their life in uncertainty. Every next step on the journey wholly depended on the defendant's ability to pay his co-conspirators to facilitate their movement. The defendant, hereby, worked with several co-conspirators, who were located throughout countries in Central America, in a hierarchical manner, of which he was the leader of. His co-conspirator facilitated the smuggled migrants' movement, managed safe houses at various locations (e.g. Guatemala, Panama) and fulfilled other organizational tasks over which the defendant had full authority over.  The smuggled migrants furthermore faced with passages through the jungle in the Darien Gap, a place known for harsh and life-threatening conditions. Throughout their route through the jungle, witnesses report little, if any access to food and water. The defendant did not inform the smuggled migrants about the long and harsh conditions they would face on their way to the States.  The Court applied aggravating circumstances to the defendant's sentence due to his leadership role and his disregard of safety and security of the smuggled migrants throughout their journey.",smuggling of migrants,1

The Coast Guard intercepted the jet skis and identified the six people as the defendant, his co-defendant R.T.-R., and four other Cuban nationals. The co-defendant was in possession of a satellite phone and Global Positioning System (“GPS”) equipment. An investigation later revealed that the jet skis were registered, on 20 June 2015, to two different owners, one of whom was defendant’s father’s best friend.Upon questioning, the defendant initially declared that he and his co-defendant were fishing with family and friends and, getting bored, decided to ride jet skis. While doing so, they would have rescued four people floating in the water.

"Border Patrol agents in an unmarked vehicle noticed a pickup on a levee road north of the Rio Grande River, at the Mexican-United States border. The vehicle stopped and a number of individuals emerged from the nearby bush. Some of them entered the vehicle’s cab, while others climbed into its bed. Someone then covered the bed with a tarp. The observing law enforcement agents then activated their lights and siren, and approached the pickup. The driver was “attempting to reverse” (as noted in the presentence report) when the pickup came to a sudden stop. Its occupants stepped down and fled into the bush. During the sentencing hearing, the Prosecution agreed “there was very limited movement, but there was movement”. According to the statements of one of the migrants, the vehicle had just “began to move” when a siren was heard and the vehicle came to a stop.The law enforcement agents gave chase and were able to apprehended ten irregular migrants, including the defendant, who was also the driver of the pickup. The defendant later admitted that, by driving the vehicle, he had received free transportation “all the way to Minnesota (United States), where [he] used to live”. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence. Legal findings:The defendant pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to transport an illegal alien within the United States and two counts of transporting an illegal alien within the United States for the purpose of commercial advantage and private financial gain, in violation of United States Code, Title 8, Section 1324. In return, the government moved to dismiss the remaining counts and urged downward adjustments, which was granted.This notwithstanding, in addition to the sentence enhancement resulting from the defendant’s criminal history, the District Court applied a further enhancement because it considered that the defendant had “intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person” because he had transported the irregular migrants in the bed of his truck. Doing so “ordinarily warrant[s] that enhancement”. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The defendant recruited and paid individuals to receive domestic and international wire transfers related to a smuggling venture. Two associated individuals in the criminal plan (participants #1 and #2), confirmed their knowledge of the defendant’s involvement in a migrant smuggling operation. Furthermore, the defendant paid participant #2 to monitor the undocumented migrants at a stash house. When participant #2 was unavailable, another man (participant #3) would carry out those tasks. In addition, every several weeks, an unknown person (participant #4) dropped off and picked up approximately four to six undocumented aliens from the house. Law enforcement agents also discovered text messages to the defendant from an unknown individual (participant #5) inquiring about money, the moving of people, and the crossing of the Rio Grande (Mexico). The defendant also delivered food and drinks for migrants. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, including from participants in the smuggling venture. Information received from Homeland Security Investigations agents was also critical in establishing the specifics of the defendant’s individual criminal responsibility. Legal findings:The defendant pled guilty to (i) one count of conspiracy to harbor an undocumented alien for financial gain, and (ii) three counts of harboring an undocumented alien. The competent District Court sentenced the defendant to four concurrent terms of 34 months of imprisonment and to a three-year term of supervised release on each count.United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal.For further details, see ‘Commentary’.",smuggling of migrants,1

"On 18 December 2012, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents in El Paso, Texas (U.S.A.) discovered a male Mexican national (V.), attempting to enter the United States without authorization, by rappelling off of a bridge with the aid of a paid smuggler known as ‘Chucky’. The irregular migrant was detained. On learning that the irregular migrant had also arranged for transport within the United States, CBP agents set up a sting operation. With the migrant’s consent, one of the agents (A1) posed as V. and answered a call on V.’s mobile phone from the suspected smuggler - a Spanish-speaking male - and requested a ride. A meeting was scheduled and the smuggler informed a certain vehicle would pick him up. Once at the designated site, A1 continued to pose as V. while fellow CBP agents (A2. and A3.) set up surveillance. A1 also surreptitiously initiated a phone call with A2, enabling the latter to hear A1’s activity. Shortly after A1’s conversation with the smuggler, the defendant arrived at the location in a vehicle matching the description previously given by the smuggler. The defendant, who was speaking on a cell phone, asked the person on the line, “What was his name?” She then asked A1 whether he was “V.” After A1 replied in the affirmative and confirmed that the defendant was aware of “V.’s” irregular status in the country, the defendant invited A1 into the vehicle. At this time, A1 dropped his cell phone, a coded signal to A2 and A3 to apprehend the defendant. The agents separately placed both the defendant and A1, still posing as V., under arrest.The agents issued the defendant her Miranda warnings, and before invoking her right to counsel, the defendant indicated that she had been at the location either to pick up her ex-husband José or to collect child support from him. Because it was dark, she would have mistaken A1 for her husband. She argued she had been set up by her ex-husband with the purpose of avoiding his parental obligations. The agents then placed the defendant in a CBP vehicle with A1, who continued to present himself as V. He repeatedly asked the defendant why she had called “the migra”, to which she replied “Who are you? I don’t know you. Don’t talk to me”. A2 testified that A1 was not aware the defendant had been Mirandized before she joined him in the CBP vehicle. A1 confirmed to have been unable to hear the defendant’s conversation with the other agents. Once the defendant requested an attorney, no agent other than A1 - always posing as V.—questioned her. Upon searching the defendant’s vehicle, authorities retrieved two cell phones and a notebook in the defendant’s purse that contained dates, the names “Enrique” and “José”, references to “girl(s)”, “guy(s)”, and a “couple”, dollar amounts, and notations in Spanish and English signifying “pick up”, “deliver”, and “food”. There were no entries in the notebook dated 18 December 2012, but there was one entry dated 16 December 2012. CBP Agent A4, who assisted in processing the defendant’s arrest and handling her possessions, photocopied the pages of the notebook on the suspicion that it served as a ledger of her smuggling activity. Another agent, A5, searched the defendant’s mobile phone call history and noticed several calls to contacts named “Enrique” and “José ex” around the time of the defendant’s apprehension. In addition, A2 interviewed V. and obtained a sworn written statement describing the events of 18 December 2012 as well as detailing the arrangements he had made with ‘Chucky’. Legal findings:The defendant was indicted for (i) conspiracy to transport aliens within the United States for private financial gain and (ii) transporting and attempting to transport an alien within the United States for private financial gain.

"This case was an appeal from a criminal proceeding brought against the defendant Adan Gutierrez-Mendez, also known as “Parajon.” In the trial court, the jury found the defendant guilty of conspiring to harbour illegal aliens and harbouring illegal aliens for commercial advantage or private financial gain. The defendant appealed, challenging the admission of certain evidence, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the sentence.The case concerns the smuggling of two female migrants from Guatemala (Migrant 1 and Migrant 2). In a first attempt in early 2011, the two migrants managed to cross the U.S. border with the help of a smuggling organization. They were given the password “Parajon” in case they were questioned while traveling, but they were captured upon entry and deported back to Guatemala.In March 2011, the two migrants in question made a second attempt to enter the United States and were again given the same password “Parajon.” They first travelled to a stash house in Mexico, where they met a man called “Beto.” Beto told them that he supervised the stash houses in Mexico that belonged to Parajon. Later, Migrant 1 and Migrant 2 crossed the river on small rafts with a group of about twenty-five people. After the migrants reached a highway, they were picked up by a man in a truck. The man told the migrants that only the Parajon group would continue. The Parajon group, consisting of about twelve people, including Migrant 1 and Migrant 2, were then taken to a house.There were three women in the Parajon group ― Migrant 1, Migrant 2, and an injured woman travelling with her family. The person in charge of the house instructed all three women to get ready to leave. While the injured woman stayed behind with her family, Migrant 1 and Migrant 2 were picked up by Beto. Beto told Migrant 1 that “she would need to ‘behave’ if she wanted things to continue to go well.” He then drove them to a trailer about twenty minutes away and introduced them to the defendant and a man named “Chano.” They were informed that the defendant was the boss of all the smuggling houses in the United States.Migrant 1 and Migrant 2 were told that they would leave the next morning at four o’clock. The defendant said that he would go ahead of the group and act as a lookout. He asked Migrant 2 whether she had paid the money she owned for her first entry and told her that she now owed them $6,000.The two women were then given several alcoholic drinks. The defendant told them to tell him “if the other men did not respect them,” because the defendant was “the boss” of the group. Later that night, the two women were separated from one another and sexually assaulted by Beto and Chano who threatened them with a knife.The next morning, Migrant 1 was informed that the plan had changed. They would go to the next stop the next day instead. After the three men left the trailer, the two women fled to a nearby house and told the owner of the house that they were threatened and kidnapped. Migrant 1 called her brother, who called the police to his house. They then reported to the police what had happened and pointed out the location of the trailer on GPS.In the appeal, the defendant challenged a piece of evidence introduced during the trial, which suggested that he had been involved in human smuggling since 2009.

"Bout has long been regarded by the United States government as a dangerous and powerful international arms trafficker, and his illicit arms pipeline has repeatedly been designated for sanctions by United States and United Nations authorities. The Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) initiated an international sting operation against Bout in late 2007 with the assistance of three confidential sources (“CSs”). Two of the CSs posed as representatives of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (the “FARC”), a Colombian entity and longtime revolutionary organization seeking the violent overthrow of the Colombian government. The FARC, which has been designated by the United States government as a foreign terrorist organization, is also one of the world’s largest cocaine suppliers and has directed violent acts toward American personnel and property.On January 10 and 11, 2008, the three CSs met with Andrew Smulian, a former colleague of Bout, on the island of Curaçao, in the Caribbean, to discuss the possibility of a multimillion-dollar weapons transaction supposedly in order to aid the FARC in its fight against the Colombian government and the United States. Following the meetings in Curaçao, Smulian visited Bout in Moscow, where they discussed the weapons order in greater detail. Bout then directed Smulian to meet the CSs to continue discussions, which later occurred over a period of two weeks in Romania. Smulian, on behalf of Bout,2 told the CSs that 100 surface-to-air (“SAM”) missiles were available immediately, and that Bout could provide additional equipment and advice if needed.On March 5, 2008, Bout met with Smulian and the three CSs about the weapons deal at a hotel in Bangkok, Thailand. During recorded conversations, Bout repeatedly supported the FARC’s intention to use his weapons to kill American pilots stationed in Colombia.3 On March 6, 2008, Thai authorities arrested both Bout and Smulian in Bangkok.

The smugglers conspired to smuggle massive quantities of counterfeit money, weapons, drugs, cigarettes and other contraband into the United States.Charges against the subjects included smuggling real and phony drugs and other contraband into the U.S. along with counterfeit $100 bills—believed to have been produced in North Korea—that were so nearly perfect and so much more sophisticated than typical counterfeit currency they were dubbed “Supernotes.” The conspirators also offered to smuggle a variety of Chinese military-grade weapons.",trafficking in firearms,0
"Andrew Duggan, Eamon Meehan, Gabriel Megahey and Colm Meehan were all members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) in Northern Ireland. PIRA is recognized as a terrorist group by the UK and the United States. The four defendants were based in the United States and were responsible for procuring weapons and explosives for the PIRA, and then illegally trafficking them to the United Kingdom, specifically England and Northern Ireland, for terrorist activities.Duggan and his co-conspirators were part of a long line of PIRA operatives seeking to illegally purchase guns in the United States to smuggle into Northern Ireland for use by the PIRA. With this representing a significant pathway by which the PIRA was arming itself in its terrorist campaign, bilateral cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States was regularly used to find and interdict PIRA cells operating in the United States.The two main reasons why Duggan and his co-conspirators were able to procure these weapons were related to the ease of purchasing firearms in the United States as well as the fact that many PIRA sympathizers, some affiliated with Irish organized crime groups, were willing to provide funding for these activities. In this specific case, the FBI received an unattributed tip that Duggan was the leader of a PIRA cell fully dedicated to arms smuggling in June 1981. Between June 1981 and June 1982, the FBI conducted significant surveillance on the cell and discovered that all four co-conspirators were engaged in the purchase and smuggling of weapons, explosives and advanced electronic equipment to be used in the Northern Irish insurgency. Given the large scale of the operation engaged in by the four co-conspirators and the threat posed by the PIRA in Northern Ireland, the case was given a high degree of priority by the US government.The FBI obtained a covert Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant which allowed them to engage in surveillance against the four co-conspirators. As a result, law enforcement was able to discover that the cell, based in New York City, NY, was making use of the port of Newark, NJ, to ship these weapons to Northern Ireland. The FBI discovered that the cell was purchasing semi-automatic carabines throughout the United States and then bringing them into New York and New Jersey to ship them to the battlefield in Northern Ireland. While the FBI was not able to directly tie the cell to Irish organized crime groups operating in the United States, the FBI strongly suspected the involvement of such an entity after conducting a sting operation centred on an attempt to sell Duggan anti-aircraft missiles, which resulted in the four co-conspirators being arrested in May 1983.",trafficking in firearms,1
"This case concerns the involvement of the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, in the sexual exploitation and abuse of minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein.From 1994 up to and including at least 2004, the defendant the defendant assisted, facilitated and contributed to the abuse of girls the defendant and her co-conspirator knew to be underage, inter alia, by recruiting, grooming and abusing said victims. The superseding indictment of this case, which was filed on 29 March 2021, regards the exploitation and abuse of four girls aged between 14 and 17.In the time period stated above, the defendant had a personal and professional relationship with the co-conspirator, which included being paid by Epstein to manage his various properties throughout the whole time frame as well as an intimate relationship from 1994 until 1997.Beginning in at least 1994, the defendant became involved in the sexual exploitation and abuse of minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein according to the superseding indictment. The defendant befriended some of Epstein’s minor victims prior to their abuse and conducted friendly conversations with the victims concerning their personal lives, their families and their school lives. The defendant and her co-conspirators would further spend time taking victims shopping or to the movies, either together or each on their own with the victims. Subsequently, the defendant and her co-conspirator would attempt to normalize sexual abuse, inter alia, by discussing sexual topics, undressing in front of the victims or being present while they undressed. The defendant would also sometimes be present for sex acts involving her co-conspirator and a victim, which would put the victim at ease since she was an adult woman. In some instances, she would further encourage victims to provide (sexualized) massages to her co-conspirator. Additionally, the defendant would encourage victims to accept assistance offered by Epstein to pay for travel and/or educational opportunities, which would make victims feel indebted to the defendant and her co-conspirator. This all happened at multiple locations, including a multi-story private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, USA, an estate in Palm Beach, Florida, USA, a ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, all owned by Epstein, and the defendant’s private residence in London, UK.According to the superseding indictment, at least one victim was encouraged by the defendant and Epstein to travel to New York for the purpose of Epstein abusing her in 1996. Moreover, the defendant and her co-conspirator additionally encouraged minor girls to visit Epstein’s Palm Beach residence to engage in sex acts with Epstein for which would later be paid hundreds of USD at least in or about 2001.The defendant and her co-conspirator would encourage at least one of the victims to travel with Epstein with the intention that the victim engage in sex acts with him. As stated in the superseding indictment, they further paid certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. Likewise, between in or about 2001 until in or about 2004, the defendant and Epstein encouraged at least one minor to engage in sex acts with Epstein according to the superseding indictment. For that purpose, employees of Epstein, including the defendant, would call victims to make an appointment to massage Epstein at his residence in Palm Beach. When a victim arrived there, she would be greeted by one of the employees, including the defendant. The victim would be escorted into a room with a massage table to provide massages to Epstein, during which he would escalate the situation. The sexual acts undertaken by Epstein and his victims included, among other things, touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. Afterwards, employees or associates of Epstein, including the defendant, paid the victim in cash.Furthermore, the defendant allegedly repeatedly made false statements, including statements regarding certain specific acts and events alleged in the indictment, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding in 2016.The defendant was arrested in New Hampshire, USA, on 2 July 2020 and initially charged with charged with enticing a minor to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. On 29 March 2021, a superseding indictment was filed, adding the charges of sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy thereof. The perjury charges were later severed and the defendant was found guilty of five of the six charges on 29 December 2021. It should be noted that, at the time of writing, only a decision in the first instance had been reached and that the defendant’s attorney had publicly mentioned her plan to appeal the verdict. Therefore, this summary might not reflect the final verdict in this case.The co-conspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, was also charged with sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking in relation to this conduct but was found dead in his jail cell on 10 August 2019. Subsequently, the charges against him were dismissed and the investigation focussed on his associates and employees.",trafficking in persons,0
"At the age of thirteen, the plaintiffs of this case were solicited and recruited for sex trafficking and manipulated into providing child pornographic videos through Snapchat.  Three years later, when they were still in high school, these child pornographic videos of the plaintiffs were posted on Twitter (by third parties). At the moment the plaintiffs learnt about the Twitter posts of their videos, they actively informed law enforcement and requested Twitter to delete them. One of the plaintiffs also provided Twitter with his driver’s license, clearly demonstrating his status as a minor. However, Twitter initially refused to delete the said content, stating that no violation of its pocilies was found. The mother of one of the plaintiffs subsequently contacted the Department of Homeland Security, who further contacted Twitter ordered to have the videos removed.  Upon the request of the Department of Homeland Security, Twitter eventually removed the content with a nine-day delay, and as a result, the child pornographic videos of the plaintiffs received more than 167,000 views and 2,223 retweets.

"Facebook filed a petition for mandamus relief before the Supreme Court of Texas directing the dismissal of three separate lawsuits against it based on human trafficking allegations. The three plaintiffs allegedly became sex trafficking victims after meeting their alleged traffickers through social media platforms owned by Facebook (Facebook and Instagram).  Specifically, according to the first lawsuit, in 2015, the Plaintiff, who was fifteen years old at that time, was approached by her alleged trafficker on Facebook. The latter contacted the Plaintiff using Facebook’s messaging system and convinced her to take her pictures by promising to help her pursue a modelling career. Her pictures were then posted to the website ‘Backpage’ advertising sexual services. As a consequence, Plaintiff was “raped, beaten and forced into further sex trafficking.” In 2012, the second Plaintiff, who was fourteen years old, was approached by her alleged trafficker via Instagram. The alleged trafficker, by promising her love and a better life, lured her into sex trafficking through social media. In particular, the alleged trafficker used Instagram to arrange “dates’” in exchange for money, during which, the alleged victim was raped. The victim’s mother had reported the said sex trafficking activities to Facebook, which never responded.  According to the third and last lawsuit, the third plaintiff was also approached by her alleged trafficker on Instagram. After two years, during which the alleged trafficker and the plaintiff were in constant communication, the alleged trafficker convinced her to meet in person, took her to a motel, took her pictures and posted them on ‘Backpage’ as an advertisement for prostitution that resulted in multiple rapes.",trafficking in persons,0
"The defendant, Ruben Andre Garcia, engaged in coercion, force, and fraud to cause women to engage in commercial sex acts. Specifically, between 2013 and 2019, he recruited young women to participate in commercial sex act videos, which were later posted on pornography websites, GirlsDoPorn (GDP), GirlsDoToys (GDT), and PornHub, without the women’s consent. He duped the women by making false representations that the videos would not be posted online, made available in the U.S., or be seen by anyone the women knew.Several other co-conspirators (Michael James Pratt, Matthew Isaac Wolfe, Theodore Wilfred Gyi, Valorie Moser, and others) participated in the sex trafficking conspiracy. The defendant, and a co-conspirator (Pratt), also a recruiter, posted fake advertisements online on Craigslist (an online classified advertisement website) for modeling jobs. To convince the victims responding to the advertisements to participate in the filming of pornographic videos, the defendant, Pratt and other co-conspirators had other women, who were paid a fee for recruitment efforts and each time a victim agreed to be filmed, contact victims to assure them that the videos would not be made available online, in the U.S., or to anyone they know. Victims complained about painful sex acts requesting that filming stop, to no avail, and were frequently threatened with lawsuits and the posting of their videos online, the cancelation of tickets for their flights home, and the blocking of the victims’ exit from the hotel rooms with equipment where they were filming the videos to make the women feel that they could not leave.The defendant pleaded guilty to “conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion” and “sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion.” For his crimes, the defendant received 240 months’ imprisonment.Two of the defendant’s co-conspirators (Gyi and Moser) each pled guilty to “conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion”. Another co-conspirator (Amberlyn Dee Nored) had the charges against her dismissed, another is currently a fugitive (Pratt), and the other (Wolfe) is still awaiting trial.",trafficking in persons,0

"This case concerns the involvement of the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, in the sexual exploitation and abuse of minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein.From 1994 up to and including at least 2004, the defendant the defendant assisted, facilitated and contributed to the abuse of girls the defendant and her co-conspirator knew to be underage, inter alia, by recruiting, grooming and abusing said victims. The superseding indictment of this case, which was filed on 29 March 2021, regards the exploitation and abuse of four girls aged between 14 and 17.In the time period stated above, the defendant had a personal and professional relationship with the co-conspirator, which included being paid by Epstein to manage his various properties throughout the whole time frame as well as an intimate relationship from 1994 until 1997.Beginning in at least 1994, the defendant became involved in the sexual exploitation and abuse of minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein according to the superseding indictment. The defendant befriended some of Epstein’s minor victims prior to their abuse and conducted friendly conversations with the victims concerning their personal lives, their families and their school lives. The defendant and her co-conspirators would further spend time taking victims shopping or to the movies, either together or each on their own with the victims. Subsequently, the defendant and her co-conspirator would attempt to normalize sexual abuse, inter alia, by discussing sexual topics, undressing in front of the victims or being present while they undressed. The defendant would also sometimes be present for sex acts involving her co-conspirator and a victim, which would put the victim at ease since she was an adult woman. In some instances, she would further encourage victims to provide (sexualized) massages to her co-conspirator. Additionally, the defendant would encourage victims to accept assistance offered by Epstein to pay for travel and/or educational opportunities, which would make victims feel indebted to the defendant and her co-conspirator. This all happened at multiple locations, including a multi-story private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, USA, an estate in Palm Beach, Florida, USA, a ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, all owned by Epstein, and the defendant’s private residence in London, UK.According to the superseding indictment, at least one victim was encouraged by the defendant and Epstein to travel to New York for the purpose of Epstein abusing her in 1996. Moreover, the defendant and her co-conspirator additionally encouraged minor girls to visit Epstein’s Palm Beach residence to engage in sex acts with Epstein for which would later be paid hundreds of USD at least in or about 2001.The defendant and her co-conspirator would encourage at least one of the victims to travel with Epstein with the intention that the victim engage in sex acts with him. As stated in the superseding indictment, they further paid certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. Likewise, between in or about 2001 until in or about 2004, the defendant and Epstein encouraged at least one minor to engage in sex acts with Epstein according to the superseding indictment. For that purpose, employees of Epstein, including the defendant, would call victims to make an appointment to massage Epstein at his residence in Palm Beach. When a victim arrived there, she would be greeted by one of the employees, including the defendant. The victim would be escorted into a room with a massage table to provide massages to Epstein, during which he would escalate the situation. The sexual acts undertaken by Epstein and his victims included, among other things, touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. Afterwards, employees or associates of Epstein, including the defendant, paid the victim in cash.Furthermore, the defendant allegedly repeatedly made false statements, including statements regarding certain specific acts and events alleged in the indictment, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding in 2016.The defendant was arrested in New Hampshire, USA, on 2 July 2020 and initially charged with charged with enticing a minor to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. On 29 March 2021, a superseding indictment was filed, adding the charges of sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy thereof. The perjury charges were later severed and the defendant was found guilty of five of the six charges on 29 December 2021. It should be noted that, at the time of writing, only a decision in the first instance had been reached and that the defendant’s attorney had publicly mentioned her plan to appeal the verdict. Therefore, this summary might not reflect the final verdict in this case.The co-conspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, was also charged with sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking in relation to this conduct but was found dead in his jail cell on 10 August 2019. Subsequently, the charges against him were dismissed and the investigation focussed on his associates and employees.",participation in organized criminal group,0
"This case concerns the defendant Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, one of the leaders of a transnational network that facilitated computer intrusions, fraudulent schemes, and money laundering. The defendant was a Nigerian national and resident of the United Arab Emirates at the time of offending.From January 2019 to June 2020, the defendant conspired with multiple other persons to conduct financial transactions into, within, and outside the United States involving property that represented the proceeds of wire fraud. The co-conspirators targeted multiple victims and laundered and/or attempted to launder funds fraudulently obtained, as well as attempted to fraudulently obtain funds, through bank cyber-heists, business email compromise (“BEC”) frauds, and other fraud schemes. In December 2019, the defendant began conspiring with a co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator A”) to defraud a businessperson, who was seeking a lender to invest USD 15,000,000 in a project to build an international school. The defendant began communicating with the businessperson using an alias and promised to assist in opening a bank account in the United States, where the loan could be deposited. The defendant arranged for another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator B”) to open a bank account at Wells Fargo Bank in Canoga Park, California in the name of a Qatari company, and file a fictitious business name statement in order to register a fictitious business entity. Subsequently, the defendant directed a co-conspirator in Nigeria (“Co-conspirator C”) to create a false and fraudulent power of attorney bearing the name of the Qatari company.  The defendant then forwarded the bank information and power of attorney to the businessperson. The defendant and Co-Conspirator A each corresponded with the businessperson to fraudulently induce the businessperson to pay approximately USD 330,000 to fund the opening of a purported “investor’s account” in order to facilitate the transfer of the USD 15,000,000 loan they promised the businessperson. The defendant himself directed the businessperson to make wire transfers of USD 230,000 to the Wells Fargo bank account of a luxury watch-seller and USD 100,000 to a Capital One bank account of another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator D”), which the businessperson did.The defendant used these funds for his personal benefit, and none of the funds were used as promised to the businessperson. The defendant used the wire transfer of USD 230,000 to purchase a luxury Richard Mille RM11-03 watch and arranged for the watch-seller to have the watch available in the New York metropolitan area, where Co-conspirator D picked it up.  Co-conspirator D and another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator E”) arranged to have the watch delivered to a different co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator F”), who was directed by the defendant to transport the watch to the United Arab Emirates in January 2020.The defendant further directed Co-conspirator D to withdraw the USD 100,000 transferred to her and convert a portion of them - minus USD 8,000 as payment for Co-conspirator D – to the Nigerian currency, which she would then send to co-conspirators who would deliver the funds to the defendant using transfers between Nigerian bank accounts. The defendant also arranged to have Co-conspirator D send cashier’s checks of USD 40,000 and USD 10,000 to another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator G”) who would use the funds to obtain St. Christopher (St. Kitts) and Nevis’ citizenship and a passport for the defendant, which he received in February 2020.In January and February 2020, the defendant and Co-conspirator A corresponded with the businessperson, attempting to fraudulently induce the businessperson to pay USD 575,000 in purported “taxes” to release the loan. In February, the businessperson wire transferred approximately USD 300,000 to bank accounts in Kenya.In the beginning of March 2020, the defendant further fraudulently induced the businessperson to send additional wire transfers to U.S. bank accounts, namely USD 100,000 to Co-conspirator D and USD 80,000 to a different co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator H”). The funds from these payments were subsequently laundered through a variety of means, with the assistance of Co-conspirators D, E, G, and H.The defendant later admitted to the following approximate actual or intended loss amounts, foreseeable to him, in connection with the victims identified:- Foreign Financial Institution: approximately USD 14,700,000.00; - Victim Companies in the U.K.: approximately USD 7,740,000.00;  - Victim Law Firm: USD 922,857.76;  - and Victim Businessperson and Qatari Victim Company: USD 809,983.58.The defendant was arrested by U.A.E. law enforcement officials in June 2020. After his expulsion from the U.A.E., FBI special agents obtained custody of Abbas and brought him to the United States to stand trial.In April 2021, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in money laundering. He was sentenced to over eleven years in prison and ordered to pay USD 1,732,841 in restitution to two fraud victims in November 2022.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The defendant, Ruben Andre Garcia, engaged in coercion, force, and fraud to cause women to engage in commercial sex acts. Specifically, between 2013 and 2019, he recruited young women to participate in commercial sex act videos, which were later posted on pornography websites, GirlsDoPorn (GDP), GirlsDoToys (GDT), and PornHub, without the women’s consent. He duped the women by making false representations that the videos would not be posted online, made available in the U.S., or be seen by anyone the women knew.Several other co-conspirators (Michael James Pratt, Matthew Isaac Wolfe, Theodore Wilfred Gyi, Valorie Moser, and others) participated in the sex trafficking conspiracy. The defendant, and a co-conspirator (Pratt), also a recruiter, posted fake advertisements online on Craigslist (an online classified advertisement website) for modeling jobs. To convince the victims responding to the advertisements to participate in the filming of pornographic videos, the defendant, Pratt and other co-conspirators had other women, who were paid a fee for recruitment efforts and each time a victim agreed to be filmed, contact victims to assure them that the videos would not be made available online, in the U.S., or to anyone they know. Victims complained about painful sex acts requesting that filming stop, to no avail, and were frequently threatened with lawsuits and the posting of their videos online, the cancelation of tickets for their flights home, and the blocking of the victims’ exit from the hotel rooms with equipment where they were filming the videos to make the women feel that they could not leave.The defendant pleaded guilty to “conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion” and “sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion.” For his crimes, the defendant received 240 months’ imprisonment.Two of the defendant’s co-conspirators (Gyi and Moser) each pled guilty to “conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion”. Another co-conspirator (Amberlyn Dee Nored) had the charges against her dismissed, another is currently a fugitive (Pratt), and the other (Wolfe) is still awaiting trial.",participation in organized criminal group,0
"The defendant (Maksim Berezan), a Latvian national, was a member of an exclusive website (“DirectConnection”) for cybercriminals engaging in cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes. To become of a member of the site, prospective users had to have three existing DirectConnection members vouch for them and had to provide information about their prior criminal history and reputation.  The existing DirectConnection members who would vouch for the prospective member would have to pay a fee as “insurance” to existing members in the event that the new member did not follow through with agreements with other members.   DirectConnection had forums with threads dedicated to specific issues of interest to members. The site also enabled users to send private messages through the site. Members also communicated off the site through Jabber and ICQ. DirectConnection had administrators, moderators, and arbiters to adjudicate disputes pursuant to the site’s dispute resolution mechanism. The defendant engaged in carding on DirectConnection, specializing in “cashouts” (i.e., the use of stolen card data and PINs to steal money from accounts or use the data to make fraudulent purchases) and “drops” (i.e., a who person receives, or forwards fraudulently obtained goods or money or a location where fraudulently obtained goods or money is dropped off). Electronic evidence in this case revealed that the defendant engaged in ransomware activities as well.The defendant was arrested in Latvia and extradited from Latvia to the United States of America to be prosecuted for his cybercrimes.

"Maksym Nienadov, a Ukrainian citizen, set up a company called Healthy Nation through which he manufactured and sold counterfeit medicine from at least July 2018 up to January 2019. As the business grew, he was joined by Volodymyr Nikolaienko.In June 2018, undercover U.S. authorities began communicating with Nienadov about the illegal sale of Keytruda on WhatsApp. A months-long exchange, which also involved Nikolaienko and resulted in the unlawful sale of counterfeit or unapproved Keytruda, Abraxane and Epclusa (Cancer and Hepatitis B drugs), followed. For the wire transfer, law enforcement received Nienadov’s banking information, which included the name “Maksim Nenadov” and his Ukrainian bank account number. After several transactions and the analysis of the counterfeit drugs by the registered trademark holders, undercover law enforcement invited the two defendants to Texas to discuss further business deals.

They were charged with various violations of Title 8, section 1324, of the United States Code, including alien smuggling, conspiracy to bring illegal aliens into the United States for financial gain, and conspiracy to transport undocumented aliens within the United States for financial gain. The organization had illegally smuggled migrants from Mexico through the southern border of California for a fee of US$ 8,000 per person. M.J.R. and S.A.S had arranged meetings at hotels and motels to obtain the fees. Arrangements had subsequently been made to send the fees to C.H.-M. in Mexico.ICT played an integral role in the logistics of the migrant smuggling operations. In particular, the leader, higher-ranking members and associates of the criminal organization used a well-known messaging application to communicate and coordinate with each other before and during smuggling operations. M.J.R. and other criminal associates were responsible for recruiting drivers for the smuggling operations. Drivers were recruited through employment advertisements on an online classified advertisement site and other websites. Among those recruited were secondary school students from San Diego, California. C.H.-M. also used ICT to monitor and track movements of operatives and migrants, as well as to inform drivers of the pick-up locations for migrants by using a well-known mapping and navigation application for mobile devices.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"This case regards the defendant’s involvement in a computer-based intrusion fraud scheme. A chief financial officer of one company, namely Unatrac Holding Limited, received an email that purportedly contained a web link to the Microsoft Office 365 login page. The victim, having an email account with this host, trusted the link and viewed it as legitimate. After clicking on the link he received in the phishing email, the page he was sent to resembled the Microsoft Office 365 login page. For this reason, the chief financial officer input his login credentials, which unbeknownst to him, were captured by criminals, including the defendant, who then used this information to access his account. His email account was then used to send fraudulent emails requesting wire transfers from other members of the company’s financial team. What is more, having observed company policy and the internal practice of forwarding emails from vendors, the perpetrator forwarded a fictitious email he had created to make it look as if a vendor was sending an invoice. Ultimately, this fraudulent scheme resulted in approximately USD 11,000,000 of wire transfers sent to the defendant and his co-conspirators.On 2 August 2019, a criminal complaint was filed against the defendant accusing him of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

"This case involved Bryan Connor Herrell, an “employee” of the dark net site “AlphaBay” who was involved in moderating thousands of illegal transactions under various monikers, including “Penissmith” and “Botah.” From 2016 through July 2017 AlphaBay was the world’s largest online black market, and shortly before its shut down in 2017 it hosted approximately 368,810 listings for the sale of various illicit goods, approximately 350,000 active buyer accounts, and over 9,000 active vendor accounts.AlphaBay was created by Alexandre Cazes, who was prosecuted separately before committing suicide while in custody, in or around July 2014. The marketplace was designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. Numerous vendors used AlphaBay to distribute controlled substances and illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars gained from these illegal transactions. At the time of writing, the site is known to have facilitated the distribution in excess of 90kg of heroin, 450kg of cocaine, and 45kg of methamphetamine.The only way to access AlphaBay was through The Onion Router (“Tor”) network. This network anonymized the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of its underlying servers and allowed vendors and buyers to hide their true identities. Additional measures were also taken to keep identities hidden as AlphaBay required its users to transact in digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum, and did not allow for transactions in official, government-backed currencies. By only accepting digital currencies, AlphaBay and its users were able to bypass the traditional financial systems. AlphaBay was set up like a conventional e-commerce website as a search tool allowed users to choose the type of illegal goods or services they wished to purchase, and users were able to sign up for free by choosing a screen name and password for their account. Furthermore, users could also search by price ranges, popularity of items, vendors, origin or shipping country, and payment types.The defendant Herrell and other co-conspirators (both known and unknown to the Grand Jury) were members and associates of AlphaBay. The marketplace operated as criminal enterprise with “employees” serving as security administrators, moderators, public relations specialists, and scam watchers (whose primary duty is to identify and remove fraudulent listings), meaning that leaders, members, and associates of AlphaBay had defined roles in the organization. The defendant in this case held the position of moderator from about May 2016 through July 2017. As moderator, Herrell had access to portions of the AlphaBay platform that were not available to the general public and had the authority to refund payments from buyers on the website, restore a user’s access to the site, engage in staff-only discussions and meetings, and view the amount of digital currency available to other members of the AlphaBay organization. Moderators also held the responsibility of moderating disputes between buyers and vendors on AlphaBay. For his work as a moderator, Herrell was paid four bitcoins per week (bitcoin was worth about USD 2,000 per coin in May 2016, and about USD 2,600 in July 2017). Through moderating disputes, the defendant Herrell had full visibility and awareness of the criminal activities occurring on AlphaBay and therefore held a role in directly facilitating these criminal activities. In addition, Herrell also held the position of scam watcher from around August 2015 to December 2015, where he monitored and quashed phishing attempts and other scams being carried out on AlphaBay. Herrell was also paid in bitcoin for this work.In 2017, Bryan Connor Herrell was indicted on the felony crime of Conspiracy to Engage in Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, USD 250,000 criminal fine, and up to 3 years supervised release. Additionally, upon conviction of this offence, Herrell also was subject to a forfeiture of property pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1963(a)(1) - (a)(3). Herrell entered into a plea agreement and was sentenced to 11 years in prison in September 2020. The following assets were forfeited: one cryptocurrency wallet containing approximately one Bitcoin, an assortment of counterfeit “Magic: The Gathering” and sports collectible cards, approximately USD 745.00 in U.S. currency, 139 gold coins (one ounce each), 8 silver dollar coins (one ounce each), one USD 1,000 bill encased in hard plastic, and one German August Schwer Cuckoo clock.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"This case involves the sentencing of a Russian national who operated two websites facilitating payment card fraud, computer hacking, and other crimes.According to the official documents, the defendant, Aleksei Burkov, operated a website called “Card Planet,” which offered stolen credit card data that had been obtained mostly through computer intrusion. There were hundreds of thousands of victims, many of them U.S. citizens. Over 150,000 stolen credit card numbers from over 1,300 banks were offered for purchase. Regarding cards of U.S. accounts alone, this resulted in over USD 20 million in fraudulent purchases.In addition, the defendant operated another website, which was invite-only, where elite cybercriminals could advertise stolen goods (i.e. personal identification data), malicious software, and criminal services, including money laundering and hacking services. To obtain membership, prospective members needed three existing members to “vouch” for them and pay a sum of money, usually USD 5,000, as insurance. These measures were aimed at avoid detection from law enforcement authorities as well as guaranteeing that their members valued the deals made on the website. To the same end, the forum removed arrested members from the site by banning them to prevent law enforcement agencies from using the arrested member and/or arrested member’s details to access the site.The defendant was arrested at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel, in December 2015. On 4 February 2016, the defendant was charged with conspiring to commit access device fraud (included in two counts), identity theft, computer intrusion, wire fraud (included in two counts), and money laundering, as well as with access device fraud and wire fraud in a superseding indictment. In 2017, an Israeli district court approved the extradition of the defendant to the United States. After the denial of the defendant’s appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli High Court of Justice, the defendant was finally extradited on 11 November 2019. On 23 January 2020, The defendant pleaded guilty to one count of access device fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, identity theft, computer intrusions, wire fraud, and money laundering on 23 January 2020.

"This case involves several offences, including conspiracy, smuggling cultural property into the U.S., obstruction of justice, and citizenship and naturalization fraud, committed by the defendant Ijaz Khan with the assistance of several co-conspirators. In 2002, the co-conspirator Vera Lautt travelled to Pakistan to meet Ijaz Khan, whom she had met online, and to sign marriage documents. Subsequently, they both submitted fraudulent documents to the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), facilitating the immigration and later naturalization of Ijaz Khan. The defendant Ijaz Khan was, however, still married to a Pakistani woman, with whom he had and continued to have children, at the time of and after signing the marriage documents. According to the indictment, Ijaz Khan used his citizenship to enable the immigration and later naturalization of his four oldest sons. He divorced Lautt before the children had arrived in the United States. He further filed or assisted with petitions on behalf of his brother, Ibar Khan, his Pakistani wife, his mother, and another two children.Following his immigration from approximately 2007 until May 2014, Ijaz and Fahad Khan, together with others, conspired to smuggle cultural artifacts (e.g., coins, pottery, arrowheads and bronze weapons) that were stolen from burial sites from Pakistan into the United States. The defendant used his company, Indus Valley, to sell the stolen cultural artifacts to his existing customer base, in person at shows, and online (on websites and auction sites, like eBay).In October 2013, a shipment was inspected and seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Subsequently, Ijaz and Fahad Khan, together with their co-conspirator John Bryan McNamara, conspired to submit fraudulent documents purporting to be from the Pakistan government authorizing his export of the cultural artifacts and certifying the value of objects. McNamara had previously pleaded guilty to smuggling the artifacts into the U.S. and making false statements to special agents when interrogated about this shipment.The defendant was identified as the leader and organizer of an organized criminal group made up of family members (e.g., wife and sons) and others who were not related to the defendant (e.g., McNamara). He played a central role in planning and operations, recruitment of accomplices, and controlled and exercised authority over others in the group. Because of his central leadership role, he received a sentencing enhancement, which he unsuccessfully appealed. The defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, a fine of approximately USD 115,000, and was required to forfeit more than 1,300 cultural artifacts. The defendant unsuccessfully appealed his conviction and sentence to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.Others in the organized criminal group pleaded guilty and were also sentenced for their roles in the conspiracy to commit smuggling, including Vera Lautt and John Bryan McNamara, who received four months’ imprisonment (and two years’ supervised release from prison) and two years of probation, respectively.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"This case involves the prosecution of members and leaders of “Clan Rincon,” one of the largest and most powerful emerald-mining families and criminal organizations in Boyacá, Colombia. Its principal leadership is composed of the brothers Pedro Nel Rincon-Castillo, Omar Josue Rincon-Castillo, and Gilberto Rincon-Castillo, part of the Rincon-Castillo family. They own emerald mines in Boyacá (most of the world’s emeralds come from Boyacá) and hold significant political and economic influence in the region. Other members of the Clan Rincon include Horacio De Jesus Triana-Romero, another well-known emerald mine owner and Jose Rogelio Nieto-Molina, former mayor of Coper, Boyacá.During the early 2000s, the left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC) began to expand their territorial control into Boyacá, taxing cocoa farmers, drug laboratory owners, and emerald mine owners. Historically, emerald mine owners in the region, including the Clan Rincon, have sold minority shares to local drug traffickers or representatives at inflated prices for them to launder illicit proceeds in addition to receiving certain protection at the mines. Therefore, to address the FARC threat, the Clan Rincon engaged a minority shareholder Yesid Nieto that had relations with the right-wing paramilitary and drug trafficking group the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, AUC) to bring the AUC to repel FARC presence. Consequently, the AUC managed to fight off the FARC and in exchange for their continued protection services, the Clan Rincon proposed they could tax cocoa farmers and drug laboratory owners, excluding emerald mine owners. With this relationship in place, it facilitated drug laboratories and traffickers, including the Clan Rincon throughout 2002 to 2015 to produce cocaine under the protection of the AUC, which ultimately resulted in the exportation of thousands of kilograms for eventual entry in the United States of America.On 28 July 2017, the aforementioned Clan Rincon members and in particular the leader Pedro Nel Rincon-Castillo, were indicted by the United States District Court of the Southern District of Florida. Defendants were indicted for their involvement in drug trafficking operations for the period 2002 throughout 2015, when they knowingly and wilfully conspired to distribute five (5) or more kilograms of cocaine to the United States of America – a controlled substance in Schedule II – in violation of Title 21, United States Code Section 960(b)(1)(B) and 963. They were later extradited from Colombia to the United States.On 15 November 2019, Jose Rogelio Nieto-Molina was sentenced to 14 years in prison. On 6 January 2020, Pedro Nel Rincon-Castillo and his brother Omar he entered a guilty plea, and was convicted for conspiring to distribute cocaine. On 16 March 2020 they were sentenced to 19 years and seven months in prison and 17 years and six months respectively, both followed by 5 years of supervised released. Horacio De Jesus Triana-Romero and Gilberto Rincon-Castillo were scheduled to be sentenced on 28 April and 4 May 2020 respectively.

"Baktash Akasha Abdalla and his brother, Ibrahim Akasha Abdalla, were the leader and deputy of a sophisticated international drug trafficking network, responsible for tonnes of narcotics shipments throughout the world. For over twenty years, they manufactured and distributed drugs and engaged in acts of violence toward those who posed a threat to their enterprise. When the brothers encountered legal interference, they bribed Kenyan officials—including judges, prosecutors, and police officers—to avoid extradition to the United States.The brothers, along with two associates, were arrested in Mombasa, Kenya by Kenyan Anti-Narcotics Unit officers in 2014, after providing 99 kilograms of heroin and two kilograms of methamphetamine to confidential sources posing as representatives of a South American drug cartel at the direction of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Following the arrests and pending extradition proceedings, the Akasha brothers continued criminal operations, using profits to bribe Kenyan officials. Their bribery scheme was frustrated in 2017 when the brothers were expelled from Kenya, and DEA agents took them to the United States for prosecution. The DEA praised the work of its Kenyan law enforcement counterparts and the government of Kenya.On October 24, 2018, Baktash and Ibrahim Akasha pled guilty in a United States Federal Court to conspiring to import and importing heroin and methamphetamine, conspiring to use and carry machine guns and destructive devices in connection with their drug-trafficking crimes, and obstructing justice. In August 2019, Baktash was convicted to 25 years in prison. In January 2020, his brother Ibrahim received a sentence of 23 years in prison.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"A group of five defendants participated in a worldwide ponzi scheme, the BitClub Network, which defrauded cryptocurrency investors. The BitClub Network required membership fees, “solicited money from investors in exchange for shares of pooled investments in cryptocurrency mining,” and “rewarded existing investors for recruiting new investors.” The funds provided by investors were purportedly required to sustain the cryptocurrency mining pools by, for example, purchasing equipment and computing power. The profits made by investors supposedly depended on the success of the mining pool operations and the number of shares investors had in the mining pools. To lure investors, keep existing investors, and get investors to provide money, the defendants fraudulently represented earnings. The group fraudulently “obtained at least [USD]… 722 million from investors.” The BCN shares sold were not registered as “securities” with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as required by law. Two of the five defendants pled guilty: Joseph Frank Abel pled guilty to “conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities” and Silviu Catalin Balaci to “conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to offer and sell unregistered securities.” At the time of writing, the remaining three defendants (Matthew Brent Goettsche, Russ Albert Medlin, Jobadiah Sinclair Weeks) have not yet been tried.",participation in organized criminal group,0
"The organized criminal group involved in this case perpetrated several cybercrimes, one of which was online auction fraud. According to the indictment, this fraud was perpetrated by members of the group by posting “hundreds or thousands of listings for automobiles, motorcycles, and other high-priced goods on eBay and similar auction sites.” The images of the items being sold that were included in these postings were infected with malware (i.e., the Bayrob Trojan). When individuals clicked on the images of the items, their devices were infected with the malware, which was designed to redirect these individuals to webpages that looked identical to the legitimate websites of the auction sites. For example, their fake eBay pages included the trademark of the organization and had a similar layout, design, and style of the legitimate eBay webpages with an important key difference. The fake eBay webpages prompted users to pay for the auctioned items using something called an “eBay escrow agent,” which does not exist on the legitimate platform. This purported service claimed to hold the money of the buyer in escrow until the item was received and the buyer was satisfied with the condition of the item delivered before the buyer’s funds were released to the seller. The webpages also included a live chat function that supposedly enabled individuals to speak with customer service agents of eBay; of course, these were not real eBay customer service agents, they were members of the group. The victims of this online auction fraud never received the items they paid for and never received a refund for the money they paid for the non-delivered items.One of the defendants (T.D.) pled guilty to aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy offences relating to wire fraud and money laundering, and received 10 years imprisonment for his crimes. B.N. and R.M. were charged, convicted, and sentenced to 20 and 18 years’ imprisonment, respectively, for aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy offences relating to wire fraud and money laundering, as well as conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit service marks.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator Brandon Arias used the moniker “The Drug Llama” on a vendor account on Dream Market (a Darknet site) to sell counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl. Melissa Scanlan was responsible for sourcing the drugs that would be sold using via the vendor account, while Brandon Arias was responsible for receiving and fulfilling Darknet drug orders, as well as the management of the account. Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator received fentanyl and other narcotics from Mexico, predominantly from Fausto Ramirez and another (unnamed) member of the Mexican cartel. After Melissa Scanlan and Brandon Arias sold the drugs, they kept a portion of the proceeds and gave the remaining criminal proceeds to couriers (usually Norma Dominguez and April Kelly, both females). The couriers would transport the proceeds across U.S.-Mexican border and deliver them to Fausto Ramirez and another member of a Mexican cartel. In one year alone, an estimated 52,000 counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl pills were sold.Melissa Scanlan was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, misbranding of drugs, international money laundering conspiracy, and distribution of fentanyl resulting in death. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 13 years and 4 months’ imprisonment.Brandon Arias was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, and misbranding of drugs.

"This case involves Gary Davis, a member of the small administrative “staff” of the Darknet marketplace “Silk Road.” During its operation from 2011 until 2013, Silk Road was used to distribute illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to more than 100,000 buyers, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of proceeds of these illicit transactions.From June to 2 October 2013, Davis, also known under his alias “Libertas,” worked as a site administrator on Silk Road. He was responsible for responding to customer support requests regarding the need for assistance with buyer or seller accounts, serving as an arbitrator by resolving disputes between drug dealers and their customers, and enforcing the rules for doing business on Silk Road, such as the rule against out of escrow sales. Davis was paid a weekly salary for his administrative services on the marketplace.Shortly after law enforcement authorities had shut down Silk Road in October 2013, its virtually identical successor, Silk Road 2.0, emerged. Davis also served as an administrator for the successor website from November to December 2013.The defendant, along with two of his co-conspirators, was charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy on 19 December 2013. Davis was arrested in Ireland in January 2014 and extradited to the United States in July 2018. Davis pleaded guilty to narcotics trafficking conspiracy on 5 October 2018 and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release on 25 July 2019. He was further ordered to forfeit USD 25,000. At the time of writing, no official information is available on the convictions of his co-defendants, Andrew Michael Jones and Peter Phillip Nash.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The defendant, Mr Gary Davis (aka “Libertas”) worked for the Silk Road website from June 2013 until 2 October 2013 (when the website was shutdown).Silk Road was an online black market created by Mr Ross Ulbricht where a wide range of illegal goods and services could be bought and sold. The platform resembled other online market places in that it required a username and password to log in, offered users a “shopping cart”, and had other like features). A variety of illicit drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy, and opioids were available for purchase on the website. The drugs purchased on Silk Road caused real harm—drugs purchased on Silk Road resulted in six deaths for overdose (though there is no suggestion that Mr Davis was responsible for any of these deaths). Counterfeit and fraudulent identity documents were also available for sale on the website—including, for instance, counterfeit US and foreign passports, US and foreign drivers’ licenses, and social security cards. Computer hacking tools and services were also available for purchase on Silk Road, including password hacking tools and services, Remote Access Tools (RAT) which allows users to obtain unauthorised remote access to a compromised computer, keyloggers which permit a user to monitor keystrokes inputted by a victim into his or her computer and used to steal confidential information, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) services which disable websites or other publicly available services on the Internet by using large networks of compromised computers to flood victim systems with malicious internet traffic. Finally, Silk Road offered money laundering services to its users, many of which were directly marketed to vendors who sold goods or services on the website. Money laundering services aimed at converting proceeds of illegal transactions (obtained in Bitcoin, the required means of payment on the Silk Road website) into other forms of currency. Vendors in this category offered, among other things, the sale of US currency, anonymous debit cards preloaded with currency and other prepaid payment systems, such as Moneypak cards.Silk Road was only accessible through the Tor network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed round the work and designed to conceal the true IP of the computers on the network and, thereby, the identities of users.The required and only payment system on Silk Road was Bitcoin—an entirely electronic currency, not issued by any bank or state, generated and controlled automatically through computer software operating on a peer-to-peer network, and operated through blockchain stored on the peer-to-peer network. On Silk Road, every user had one (or more) Silk Road Bitcoin address associated with their own Silk Road account. The Bitcoin address could be used by each user to deposit funds into their Silk Road account. These addresses were stored on “wallet” files maintained on computer servers controlled by Mr Ulbricht. To make purchases on the website, therefore, a user had to first obtain Bitcoin (for example, from a Bitcoin exchanger) and send these to a Bitcoin address associated with the user’s Silk Road account. Once the purchase took place, the funds were debited from the user’s Silk Road account and held in escrow in a wallet file maintained by Silk Road pending completion of the transaction. Once the transaction was completed the vendor’s Silk Road account would be credited with the payment minus the commission Silk Road took on the sale (8–15% of the transaction). The vendor would then withdraw the Bitcoins from his Silk Road account by transferring them to an outside Bitcoin address, such as the address of a Bitcoin exchanger who would cash out the Bitcoins for real currency. The vendors would also convert their Bitcoins into other currencies, by using money laundering services offered on the website.Silk Road would also use a so-called “tumbler” to hinder the tracking of individual transactions through the blockchain. In a nutshell, the “tumbler” would obscure any link between both the buyer’s and the vendor’s Bitcoin addresses. It would, therefore, make the use of blockchain to follow the money trail useless, even if both the vendor’s and buyer’s Bitcoin addresses were known.Mr Ulbricht ran the website with some support staff (they were four when Silk Road was shutdown by law enforcement on 2 October 2013), who were divided into forum moderators and site administrators. Forum moderators were responsible for, among other things, monitoring user activity on discussion forums associated with the site, providing guidance to forum users concerning how to conduct business on Silk Road, and reporting any significant problems discussed on the forums to the site administrators and Mr Ulbricht. Site administrators were in charge of responding to customer support requests from Silk Road users who needed assistance with their buyer or seller accounts; investigating disputes that arose between vendors and buyers, including reporting their findings to Mr Andrew Michael Jones (another site administrator) or Mr Ulbricht; and helping enforce the rules for doing business on Silk Road. This last responsibility included demoting vendors or referring them to Mr Ulbricht for further discipline. This could happen when vendors and buyers would communicate on Silk Road and decide to conclude the sale offsite to avoid paying to Silk Road a commission (this was called “out of escrow” sales).Mr Gary Davis first worked for a month as a forum moderator of Silk Road. He then was “promoted” to site administrator. As a site administrator, he demoted an account that was likely compromised by the police and posted some posts on the forum advising users how to conceal their true identities. When Silk Road was shut down by law enforcement on 2 October 2013, Mr Davis helped with the launch of “Silk Road 2.0”, a website which was created in the month following Silk Road’s demise. Mr Davis used his credibility with the original Silk Road community to vouch for the new website. He worked on the new version of Silk Road as a site administrator for one month, until he was arrested in Ireland in January 2014.Mr Davis was extradited from Ireland to the US in July 2018. He pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to traffic a controlled substance (narcotics). He was sentenced to six years and six months’ imprisonment on 25 July 2019.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The defendant, Joaquin Archivaldo Guzman Loera, also known as ""El Chapo"", was, since 1994, a leader of the Sinaloa Cartel alongside Ismael Zambada Garcia. The Sinaloa Cartel was one of the most powerful drug trafficking organisations in Mexico.Guzman transported illicit drugs with the use of fishing boats, submarines, carbon fibre airplanes, trains with secret compartments and underground tunnels. Once the narcotics were in the United States, they were sold to wholesale distributors. Guzman then used various methods to launder billions of dollars of drug proceeds, including US-based insurance companies, reloadable debit cards, numerous shell companies, including a juice company and a fish flour company, and the smuggling cash in bulk from the United States to Mexico.Guzman was arrested in 2016 in Mexico and was extradited in 2017 to the US where he was convicted of continuing criminal enterprise; possession, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances; use of firearms; and laundering of monetary instruments and sentenced to life imprisonment on 17 July 2019.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"Mr Vincent Ramos was the founder and CEO of a Canada-based company called Phantom Secure. Phantom Secure was founded by Mr Ramos, Mr Kim August Rodd and another individual in 2008. Phantom Secure sold custom, modified BlackBerry mobile phones. Additionally, Phantom Secure operated an encrypted network that allowed its devices to send and receive encrypted messages. Mr Ramos advertised Phantom Secure’s products as impervious to decryption, wiretapping or legal third-party records requests.According to Phantom Secure’s own marketing materials, the company purchased Blackberry handsets which it then modified to remove the hardware and software responsible for all external architecture, including voice communication, microphone, GPS navigation, camera, Internet and messaging services. It then installed an email program using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption software and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The email program routed its traffic through encrypted servers located in countries and jurisdictions believed by Phantom Secure to be uncooperative with law enforcement, such as Panama and Hong Kong SAR of China. The locations of Phantom Secure’s encrypted servers were also disguised through multiple layers of virtual proxy networks (VPNs). Clients of Phantom Secure were provided with custom email addresses for using the email program on Phantom Secure’s devices. Phantom Secure devices and services were provided to clients at a cost of approximately USD 2,000–3,000 per six-month subscription.According to an informant, Phantom Secure’s devices were specifically designed, marketed and distributed for use by transnational criminal organisations, specifically those involved in drug trafficking. According to law enforcement sources in Australia, Canada and the United States of America, Phantom Secure devices were used by senior members of numerous transnational criminal organisations to communicate with their criminal partners. These sources further stated that they were unaware of any law enforcement agency that had identified even a single legitimate Phantom Secure user. Phantom Secure devices were used to facilitate the distribution of wholesale quantities of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines throughout the world, including the United States of America, Australia, Mexico, Canada, Thailand and Europe.US authorities received intelligence that some members of the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico were users of Phantom Secure devices. Another example of a client of Phantom Secure was Mr Owen Hanson, who used six Phantom Secure devices to coordinate the transportation of more than a tonne of cocaine from Mexico into the United States of America and on to Canada and Australia.Phantom Secure did not sell its devices to the general public. Rather, the company operated on an exclusive referrals basis whereby a prospective client could not purchase a Phantom Secure device if they received a personal reference from an existing client. Phantom Secure not only verified the reference from the sponsoring client, but also conducted its own open-source checks to verify the prospective client’s identity. US authorities believed that the purpose of this procedure was to prevent law enforcement from penetrating Phantom Secure’s network.To protect clients’ identities, Phantom Secure did not request, track or record their clients’ real names or other identifying information, but rather interacted with them using usernames, email addresses, or nicknames.Phantom Secure routinely deleted and destroyed evidence from devices that it knew had been seized by law enforcement. Indeed, it guaranteed that clients’ messages would be remotely deleted if the device was seized by law enforcement or compromised.After a news article published on 5 March 2014 stated that law enforcement investigations of a gangland murder were frustrated because the suspects used Phantom Secure devices to coordinate the killing, Mr Ramos wrote that ‘this is the best verification on what we have been saying all along – proven and effective for now over nine years. It is the highest level of authority confirming our effectiveness. It can’t get better than that.’At the time of Mr Ramos’ arrest, one US government estimate ‘conservatively’ put the number of Phantom Secure devices in use at 7,000. Another estimate filed in the application for Mr Ramos’ arrest stated that there were more than 20,000 Phantom Secure devices in use worldwide, including approximately 10,000 in Australia.In pleading guilty to the charges against him, Mr Ramos admitted that at least 450 kilograms of cocaine were distributed using Phantom Secure devices, though the real amount would have been significantly larger. The US government stated that ‘the amount of drugs Phantom Secure aided and abetted in transporting by providing devices and services to criminals worldwide was too high calculate.’US authorities estimated that Phantom Secure generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue through the provision of its services. It believed that Phantom Secure laundered the proceeds of its device and services sales through several shell companies. Phantom Secure also used Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to launder its earnings.Organisational structureThe organisational structure of the Phantom Secure criminal enterprise included individuals with roles as administrators, distributors and agents. Administrators included Phantom Secure’s corporate executives and front office staff who had physical control of the Phantom Secure network, Phantom Secure’s books and records, and its corporate operations. Administrators could initiate new subscriptions, remove accounts and remotely wipe and reset devices. As the CEO of Phantom Secure, Mr Ramos was its lead administrator. Mr Rodd was also alleged to have served as an administrator of Phantom Secure. Individual A was also said to have held ‘an integral role in the design and maintenance of the security integrity’ of Phantom Security.Distributors coordinated agents and resellers of Phantom Secure devices and received payments for ongoing subscription fees, which they transferred, minus a personal commission, back to Phantom Secure. They also provided technical support and communicated directly with Phantom Secure administrators. Messrs Nasri, Poquiz and Gamboa were all alleged to have been distributors for Phantom Secure.Agents physically sourced and engaged with new customers to sell and deliver Phantom Secure devices. They earned a profit on the sale of the handset and provided first-level technical support to their customers.Arrest and indictmentThe case against Messrs Ramos, Rodd, Nasri, Gamboa and Poquiz stemmed from an investigation in the Southern District of California which related to a Phantom Secure client who used Phantom Secure devices to traffic thousands of kilograms of cocaine and other illicit substances around the world.On 28 February 2018, a warrant for Mr Ramos’ arrest was issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. On 7 March 2018, Mr Ramos was taken into custody in Bellingham, Washington, United States of America.Pursuant to an indictment filed 18 March 2015, Messrs Ramos, Rodd, Nasri, Gamboa and Poquiz were charged with racketeering conspiracies in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962 and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841 and 846. The indictment also sought the forfeiture of USD 80 million as proceeds of crime, as well as specifically identified assets such as international bank accounts, real estate, cryptocurrency accounts, and gold coins.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"BackgroundTotal Reclaim, Inc. (“Total Reclaim”) a US-based corporation, served large public and private entities with processing and recycling of electronic consumer waste. Owners and CEOs of Total Reclaim were the defendants Craig Lorch and Jeffrey Zirkle. At the time, the corporation was known as the “Northwest’s largest Electronics Recycling Firm”. Among other things, the company accepted computers, monitors and printers from entities such as the City of Seattle, the University of Washington, as well as various waste management companies.Total Reclaim was further the largest processor of Washington’s E-Cycle program. “E-Cycle Washington” aims to ensure the safe and environmentally sound recycling of consumer electronics. This program offers disposal sites where consumers can deposit used electronic products free of charge. Processor such as Total Reclaim are contracted and paid to transport and dispose of these products under regulations by the Washington Department of Ecology.Responsible transportation and disposal of electronic waste is important due to hazardous materials included in such. Among others, Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) contain mercury which may cause organ and nerve damage, mental impairment and more. Hence, dismantling such waste requires certain recycling capacities including safety equipment which is regularly lacking in developing countries.Total Reclaim’s positioning as environmentally responsible waste processorDue to the risk posed by improper transport and disposal of waste, many environmentally conscious entities are looking for processors following responsible recycling protocols. More often than not, such protocols include banning the export of hazardous materials to non-OECD countries. The defendants advertised Total Reclaim as a responsible processor and highlighted the claim that they would not export any hazardous waste to non-OECD countries. Through this, they positioned Total Reclaim as an environmentally responsible corporation. As part of their commitment, Craig Lorch in 2003 signed the Electronic Recycler’s Pledge of True Stewardship on behalf of Total Reclaim, including the promise that no hazardous e-waste would be exported to developing countries neither directly nor through intermediaries. The same claims were made in an Environmental Health and Safety Policy Statement on the company’s website. Comparably, the defendants promoted their corporation’s certification as “E-Steward” under the Basel Action Network and claimed to comply with the Washington Department of Ecology’s Preferred Processor Standards. Their commitments included submitting to an annual audit as a sign of goodwill. Thus, most of Total Reclaim’s service agreements prohibited the company from exporting hazardous materials to non-OECD countries.Illegal export of hazardous waste to Hong KongIn or around 2008, Total Reclaim started receiving LCDs by its customers for processing and recycling. The defendants were aware of the fact that LCDs contain mercury. Notwithstanding, they agreed to a volume exceeding their processing capacities. Since hiring a domestic company would have meant enduring substantial expenses, the defendants decided to sell the monitors to a third-party exporter called M-Stream, knowing that the LCDs would be exported to Hong Kong and that such arrangements were contrary to Total Reclaim’s representation and would constitute a significant violation of their service agreements. Until early 2016, the defendants used this method to sell over eight million pounds of LCDs to M-Stream, who in turn shipped approximately 400 shipping containers worth of e-waste to Hong Kong. This business paid-off well for the defendants, as they received USD 1,182,113 from their customers to process the waste and an additional USD 1,032,215 from M-Stream for the LCDs.Concealment and revealment In order to conceal these illegal shipments, the defendants provided false information and falsified documents during audits, claiming that all mercury-containing devices were disposed domestically. In a similar fashion, they falsified their annual reports.In late 2015, representatives of the Basel Action Network found evidence that Total Reclaim had indeed exported LCDs to Hong Kong. The non-governmental organization conducts studies of exports of electronic waste. In that context, it had equipped an LCD with a tracking device and deposited it for recycling. Representatives of the Network were thus able to track the by Total Reclaim collected monitor all the way to Hong Kong. They followed the monitor and discovered that upon arrival, the LCDs were transported to outdoor processing centres,where they would be taken apart through an archaic process without protective equipment, causing “the release of mercury into the workplace and broader ecosystem”.In an attempt to cover up their activities, the defendants denied exporting LCDs and began falsifying hundreds of shipping documents and convinced M-Stream to do so accordingly. Upon realizing that the Basel Action Network was not convinced to belief that Total Reclaim had indeed not exported any hazardous waste, the defendants claimed that the decision to export LCDs was of a “short-term business” nature, when in fact, this illegal practice was ongoing since eight years.SentencingOn 14 November 2018, the defendants were charged with Conspiracy to commit the offense of wire fraud in contravention of Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1343. In April 2019, the defendants were sentenced to 28 months in prison and three years of supervised release. They agreed to a restitution payment of USD 945,663.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"This case involves two separate incidents, firstly arson and, secondly, a bank robbery, which both included members of infamous organized crime families.In April 2012, Vincent Asaro, a long-time Bonanno crime family member, was driving his car in Howard Beach when another driver switched lanes in front of him at a traffic light. Asaro proceeded to chase the vehicle at a high speed before the driver got away. Asaro contacted an associate of the Gambino organized crime family of La Cosa Nostra, who had access to local law enforcement databases, to obtain the home address of the owner of the vehicle. Asaro then directed an associate of the Bonanno organized crime family (“Associate-1”) to set fire to the victim’s car. Associate-1 recruited the defendants John J. Gotti and Matthew Rullan to help him set fire to the vehicle. Gotti is the grandson of the infamous John Gotti who was a member and leader of the Gambino organized crime family. Associate-1, Gotti, and Rullan drove in Gotti’s Jaguar sedan to a service station to fill a container with gasoline. Associate-1 poured the gasoline onto the car and Rullan ignited it. An NYPD officer in an unmarked car witnessed the crime and pursued the Jaguar in a high-speed chase, but eventually stopped his efforts due to Gotti’s reckless driving. The next day, Asaro drove to the auto body shop where the burned car was to confirm that the order was carried out.Two weeks later, on 18 April 2012, defendants Gotti, Michael Guidici, and Rullan robbed Maspeth Federal Savings and Loan Association. Guidici entered the Bank and handed the bank teller a note stating “I HAVE A BOMB” demanding money and other things. The teller handed over USD 5,491 to Guidici. Guidici joined Gotti and Rullan in the getaway car and fled the scene.On 8 March 2017 an indictment was filed against the defendants which included the charges arson conspiracy (count one), arson (count two), bank robbery conspiracy (count three) and bank robbery (count four).",participation in organized criminal group,1
"Between 2015 and 2017, the defendant Sergiy Petrovich Usatyuk and a co-conspirator deployed booter services for financial gain, allowing paying users to utilize their services to launch DDoS attacks. Specifically, the defendant and the co-conspirator developed software and created, controlled, and operated a website and infrastructure (e.g., domain names and servers in the U.S. and Romania) to enable paying users to deploy DDoS attacks. One of the most popular booter services used included ExoStresser. Other services offered included Betabooter, Databooter, DecafeStresser, Instabooter, IP Booters, IP Stressors, Polystress, QuezStresser, and Zstress. The booter services the defendant provided along with his co-conspirator were used to conduct 1,367,610 DDoS attacks against systems inside and outside of the United States. These DDoS attacks not only caused harm to the computer systems directly targeted, but also caused harm to computers systems not directly targeted by the attacks. The defendant and the co-conspirator also created and maintained the payment and cryptocurrency accounts needed to obtain the proceeds of crime. The defendant and co-conspirators further engaged in tactics to conceal their identities and activities. In 2019, the defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to cause damage to protected computers.

"This case involved a sextortion scheme perpetrated by inmates in the South Carolina Department of Corrections, as well as co-conspirators outside of the prison, against U.S. military personnel. In this sextortion scheme, the inmates, using smartphones they smuggled into the prison, signed up for dating apps and targeted U.S. military members utilizing these apps. The defendants and co-conspirators created fake profiles of women using images that they found online. After contacting the targets and obtaining personal information from them, the inmates would send naked images of the person they were impersonating (images which were also found online) and request that the targets provide nude images. The inmates would then call the targets impersonating the father of the person the targets were in contact with (i.e., the women in the profile). The inmates would proceed to misinform the targets that they were communicating with a minor and that what the targets had in their possession (i.e., the naked image) was considered child sexual abuse material. The inmates would then threaten to contact the authorities and report the individuals if money was not paid to the “victim”. The targets were directed to pay these fees using wire transfers via Western Union, MoneyGram, Walmart, and PayPal. The inmates recruited money mules, who received the wire transfers from the military members and would then send the funds to the inmates as directed.The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, extortion, and money laundering. Several of the defendants pled guilty. Specifically, Tiffany Reed pled guilty and was sentenced to three years’ probation for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Another defendant, Wendell Wilkins, also pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, but has yet to be sentenced. Jalisa Thompson, Brandon Thompson pled guilty to money laundering and were sentenced to time served and 15 months’ imprisonment, respectively. The prosecution also submitted a motion to dismiss the indictment against one of the defendants, namely, Laben McCoy.

"This case involved Ronald L. Wheeler, an “employee” of the dark net site “AlphaBay” who was involved in, inter alia, moderating the AlphaBay subreddit, moderating the AlphaBay message board forums, and mediating sales disputes, under the monikers “Trappy” and “Trappy_Pandora.” From 2016 through July 2017, AlphaBay was the world’s largest online black market, and shortly before its shut down in 2017, hosted approximately 368,810 listings for the sale of various illicit goods, approximately 350,000 active buyer accounts, and over 9,000 active vendor accounts.AlphaBay was created by Alexandre Cazes, who was prosecuted separately before committing suicide while in custody, in or around July 2014. The marketplace was designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. Numerous vendors used AlphaBay to distribute controlled substances and illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars gained from these illegal transactions. At the time of writing, the site is known to have facilitated the distribution in excess of 90kg of heroin, 450kg of cocaine, and 45kg of methamphetamine.The only way to access AlphaBay was through The Onion Router (“Tor”) network. This network anonymized the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of its underlying servers and allowed vendors and buyers to hide their true identities. Additional measures were also taken to keep identities hidden as AlphaBay required its users to transact in digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum, and did not allow for transactions in official, government-backed currencies. By only accepting digital currencies, AlphaBay and its users were able to bypass the traditional financial systems. AlphaBay was set up like a conventional e-commerce website, as a search tool allowed users to choose the type of illegal goods or services they wished to purchase, and users were able to sign up for free by choosing a screen name and password for their account. Furthermore, users could also search by price ranges, popularity of items, vendors, origin or shipping country, and payment types.On 25 May 2015 at the latest, the defendant began working for AlphaBay as a public relations specialist. His duties included moderating the AlphaBay subreddit on the website reddit.com, moderating the AlphaBay message board forums, mediating sales disputes among AlphaBay users, promoting AlphaBay online, and providing non-technical assistance to AlphaBay users. The defendant was paid in Bitcoin for his services. His work continued until the website was shut down.The defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit acces device fraud. He pleaded guilty in March 2018 and was sentenced to three years, 10 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release on 31 July 2018.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"This case involves a transnational criminal organization (called the “Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network” by U.S. authorities in the criminal indictment) which perpetrated online auction fraud (i.e., advertising and selling non-existent items) against U.S. victims on eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, and AutoTrader.com. The organization primarily operated in Alexandria, Romania, with some operations taking place in other areas of Eastern Europe, as well as the United States. The victims of the online auction fraud paid for the fake items with “reloadable prepaid cards, prepaid debit cards, and gift cards of varying types (collectively referred to herein as ‘prepaid debit cards’), including Green Dot Moneypaks, Visa One Vanilla prepaid debit cards, PayPal My Cash cards, and Amazon gift cards; United States postal money orders; cashier’s checks; MoneyGram and Western Union wires; and bank wires and deposits.”The Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network worked with others to launder criminal proceeds, by taking the money paid by victims for the fake items sold online, converting the money to Bitcoin, transferring the Bitcoin to members and associates in Eastern Europe, and using Bitcoin exchanges to convert the Bitcoin to fiat currency. Associates of the organizations in the United States, such as J.A.V., obtained victim payments, converted them to Bitcoins, and sent the Bitcoins to members of the organization who had perpetrated the online auction fraud. Third-party money launderers in the U.S. (i.e., A.E.N., D.A.B., and R.W.D.L.T) were also used to collect, redeem, and convert victim payment into cash or Bitcoins. Additionally, two Bitcoin exchangers were used by the Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network. Particularly, a Bulgarian national (Rossen Iossifov) owner of a Bitcoin exchange (RG Coins), registered in Bulgaria, was charged and convicted for conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit money laundering in contravention of U.S. laws. A Romanian national (Vlad-Calin Nistor) owner of a Bitcoin exchange (Coinflux Services SRL), registered in Romania, pled guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering.In total, 20 individuals, 16 of which were foreign nationals, were charged in the United States, and 12 of the foreign nationals were extradited to the United States. At the time of writing, 17 individuals have been convicted for crimes relating to the online auction fraud perpetrated by members and associates of the criminal organization, including (but not limited to): conspiracy to commit racketeering, money laundering, and wire fraud, and well as identity-related fraud.",participation in organized criminal group,0
"This case involves an international online child sexual exploitation ring, the Bored group, which met, organized its activities, and operated exclusively online. The Bored group earned this nickname because the chatrooms they created all included the word “bored” in them. Initially, the group met on Stickham, a social media platform which was popular for live streaming video chats. Frustrated with the moderation that existed on this site, they migrated to other sites and ultimately ended up using one unidentified site that was not moderated. The chatrooms they created on this site could not be found unless the person knew the URL of the chatroom.The perpetrators devised and executed a plan to lure targets from moderated platforms to an unmoderated chatroom-based forum and entice them to engage in sex acts. Specifically, the members of the group worked together to recruit, entice, and coerce minors to engage in sex acts during video-chat sessions. To accomplish this, members of the group created fake profiles of teenage boys on social media and dating sites, such as MYLOL.com, Periscope, YouNow, and Gifyo, to target minor girls. The members would then identify minors to target, contact, and communicate with in order to get the victims to join the offenders in unmonitored chatrooms. All of the members of the group spent a considerable amount of time communicating with their targets in order to gain their trust, build rapport with them, and ultimately, entice the victims to commit sex acts. Beyond communication, Bored group members used several techniques to manipulate victims, including:1. Dares. Daring minors to engage in sexualized behaviour and sex acts.2. Polls. Running polls with participants in the chat rooms about the attractiveness of minors and/or voting on what type of items of clothing the minor should remove and/or what type of sex act the minor should engage in.3. Competitions. Minors were pitted against each other in an effort to be rewarded (i.e., they would receive points for engaging in certain sexualized behaviour and sex acts, and advance levels based on points).4. Purporting to Block Cameras. To reduce the inhibitions of minors, members who victims trusted (called “handlers”) would claim that they could block the camera and prevent others in the chatroom from viewing the victims. When the handler told other group members that this tactic was used, the participants in the chatroom would pretend that they were unable to see the victim’s web camera.  5. Loops. Pre-recorded videos of minors talking and/or engaging in sexualized behaviour or sex acts.  These videos were played as if they were occurring in real-time in order to manipulate a minor into engaging in similar conduct and/or acts. The Bored group had distinct roles for members: hunters, talkers, and loopers. Hunters lured victims to the chatroom. Talkers handled the next phase, which involved convincing the minors to undress and masturbate on camera by engaging them in conversation and building trust and rapport. Loopers posed as a female minor and played a pre-recorded video of a previous victim talking or engaging in sex acts (but passed it off as if it was playing in real-time). Loopers played these pre-recorded videos in an effort to convince girls to perform a sex act.As a method to monitor, evaluate, and coordinate their activities, track progress, and share their knowledge and expertise, they would discuss their plans, activities, and experiences on a separate site (the now defunct Titan Pad) and record their activities and experiences on a password-protected spreadsheet on that site that included information about which chatrooms on the website were associated with which victims and the social media accounts associated with members that were used to lure each of the victims. The spreadsheet also enabled the members of the group to keep track of the manipulation techniques that were successful with each victim and what sex acts each victim engaged in (including extremely depraved acts; e.g., one member of the group enticed a minor to engage in a sex act with a dog). After Titan Pad ceased its operation in 2017, the Bored group moved its activities to Discord, a group chat platform, with voice and video capabilities.The defendant, Caleb Young, pled guilty to child exploitation enterprise and received 30 years’ imprisonment for his crime. Other members of the group were also charged and sentenced for their crimes. C.M., the leader of the child exploitation enterprise, received 40 years’ imprisonment for his crime. He was killed in prison during an altercation with other inmates in January 2019. Other members of the group received 38 years’ (A.S.), 37 years and 6 months’ (O.O.), 35 years’ (J.N.R.), 31 years and 3 months’ (M.F.), and 30 years and 6 months’ imprisonment (B.J.S. and D.W., each) for their crimes.

"Carl Allen Ferrer, the CEO and one of the co-founders of Backpage, a now defunct online classified advertisement site, pled guilty to “conspiracy to commit offence or to defraud United States” in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. In his plea agreement, he acknowledged that the majority of revenue for the site came from illegal advertisements and that Backpage used bank accounts for shell companies and cryptocurrency processing companies (i.e., CoinBase, Crypto Capital, GoCoin, Kraken, and Paxful) to conceal the source of its revenue. He also acknowledged in his plea agreement that he conspired to sanitize advertisements by removing words and photos that were indicative of prostitution. As part of the plea deal, Ferrer is required to forfeit the company’s assets and property, take all the steps in his power to permanently shut down Backpage, and testify that Backpage engaged in money laundering and facilitated prostitution.

"In 2001, Manitoba, Canada-based Kristjan Thorkelson founded Canada Drugs as an online pharmacy based in Winnipeg, Canada. Canada Drug’s business model was based on illegally importing unapproved and misbranded prescription pharmaceutical drugs into the United States from abroad and selling the drugs illegally to consumers throughout the United States.The drugs were illegally imported into the United States through the systematic use of fraudulent customs declaration forms, which consistently undervalued the price of the drug products in order to avoid detection by United States regulatory and law enforcement authorities. The role of Thorkelson was the Chief Executive Officer of Canada Drugs and, with other co-conspirators, he distributed within the United States substantial quantities of prescription drugs, including clinical cancer medications that were not approved by the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA).After approximately eight years of operating this illegal scheme, in 2009, Canada Drugs’ market was expanded to include acquiring prescription drugs, including life-saving cancer medication, intended for sale in foreign countries and illegally smuggling the drugs into the United States for distribution. As part of this expansion, Canada Drugs acquired other companies engaged in similar illegal prescription drug importation and distribution activities and used the brand names, drug inventories, and customer lists of those companies to further its illegal operation.CANADA DRUGS conducted its clinical sales through several subsidiaries, including Rockley Ventures, Global Drug Supply and RIVER EAST which operated in United States, Canada, Barbados and United Kingdom. During the criminal investigation, it was discovered that entities affiliated with Canada Drugs had distributed in the United States counterfeit cancer drug Avastin (American version) and counterfeit cancer drug Altuzan (Turkish version). FDA Office of Criminal Investigation agents learned that executives and employees of Canada Drugs had systematically undervalued the declared value of each shipment of pharmaceutical drugs on customs forms in order to conceal the illegal importation of the unapproved and misbranded drugs into United States.It was in approximately 2009, CANADA DRUGS began selling unapproved and misbranded prescription drugs directly to physicians and physician office practices in the United States. When Canada Drugs discovered that there had been a significant breach in its supply chain and it might be distributed counterfeit Avastin to physicians in the United States, they made no attempt to notify FDA or any other authorities.The counterfeit Avastin distributed by Canada Drugs-affiliated entities was discovered in December 2011, when the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcase Products Regulatory Agency notified the FDA of a potential counterfeit batch of oncology drug which River East Supplies had purchased from a supplier in the European Union.From 2009 until 2012, CANADA DRUGS profited heavily from its criminal enterprise. During that time, CANADA DRUGS generated at least $78 million in gross proceeds from the illegal sale of unapproved new drugs, misbranded drugs and counterfeit drugs in the United States. Furthermore, CANADA DRUGS systematically moved its proceeds from accounts in the United States to accounts in Barbados, and then ultimately transferred the profits to accounts in Canada.In total, CANADA DRUGS facilitated the transfer of at least $78,184,482 in gross proceeds from its illegal enterprise into bank accounts held by ROCKLEY VENTURES in Barbados.The Defendants involved were the legal persons CANDADRUGS.COM, Rockley Ventures, Global Drug Supply, River East Supplies and the individuals Kristjan Thorkelson, Thomas Haughton, Ronald Sigurdson, Narinder Kaulder, Troy Nakamura, Darren Chalus.They were convicted for: -       Conspiracy to Smuggle Goods into the United States.-       Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering.-       International Money LaunderingAs the direct result of the illegal conduct of Thorkelson, consumers and patients, including those needing life-saving chemotheraphy, were at risk of receiving drugs that were not approved by the FDA for use in the United States.It was in December 2017 when the defendant, K.T. agreed to plead guilty to the superseding information, which charges the crime of Misprision of Felony.  The United States and Thorkelson jointly request that the Court accept Thorkelson’s plea and plea agreement, and impose a sentence of 60 months probation, the first 6 months to be served under home detention, a fine in the amount of$250,000, a special assessment of $100, and additional conditions of probation, which include causing the permanent cessation of the sale of all unapproved, misbranded, adulterated, or counterfeit drugs in the United States and cooperating fully with the United States in this ongoing and future criminal prescription drug investigations.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"This case involves the co-founders, administrators and members of the Infraud Organization, which was founded in 2010 and was active between 2010 and 2018. The slogan of the organization was “in fraud we trust.” The Infraud Organization operated as a criminal enterprise with its objective of financially enriching its members through cybercrimes, particularly online fraud and identity theft. The illicit acts the organization engaged in included money laundering, identity theft, counterfeit identification trafficking, bank fraud, wire fraud, among other crimes. In total, the organization caused USD 568 million in actual losses and USD 2.2 billion in intended losses. The Infraud Organization ran an online discussion forum, known as Infraud, which had over 10,000 members from around the world. According to the Second Superseding Criminal Indictment, the roles of individuals that were part of this criminal enterprise included administrators, super moderators, moderators, vendors, VIP members, and members:1. Administrators.  Administrators were responsible for “long-term strategic planning” of the enterprise, and daily management tasks, such as determining responsibilities and levels of access of all members, vetting prospective members, deciding which members can join, and rewarding and punishing existing members.2. Super Moderators. Super moderators were responsible for moderating content by reviewing contraband for sale, editing and deleting posts based on reviews, and mediating disputes between buyers and vendors (i.e., sellers). The content they moderated was assigned based on either geographic area or criminal expertise.3. Moderators. Moderators have some of the same responsibilities for moderating content, but they have less privileges and authority than super moderators. 4. Vendors. Individuals who sold and/or advertised illicit goods and services on the site.5. VIP members. VIP members were longstanding, distinguished members of the platform.6. Members.  General members of the forum.The founders of the organization are Svyatoslav Bondarenko and Sergey Medvedev. Along with being a co-founder, Sergey Medvedev served as the administrator of the site and ran the escrow service of the organization, which held funds for a purchase in escrow until the buyer received the items purchased (in good order). He further created a virtual currency exchange service where virtual currencies were exchanged for fiat currencies, promoted, created incentives, and set prices for advertisements on Infraud. The defendant assumed leadership of the organization after Svyatoslav Bondarenko disappeared.For quality control of contraband recovered from acts of fraud and identity theft, members provided feedback and ratings of vendors and their products. To protect individuals who are part of this criminal enterprise, measures were taken to secure the site and restrict access to the site. Svyatoslav Bondarenko established rules governing the conduct of members on Infraud and these rules were enforced by administrators, moderators, and supermoderators of the forum. Members who violated these rules were punished by, for example, being removed and banned from the site. All new members had to be vetted before being granted access to the forum.In this case, 36 defendants were charged for their roles in the Infraud Organization. The criminal proceedings for most of these defendants are still ongoing. The defendant, one of the founders of Infraud, Sergey Medvedev, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in a racketeer influenced corrupt organization. The other founder, Svyatoslav Bondarenko, is still at large. Two other defendants and members of Infraud pleaded guilty to engage in a racketeer influenced corrupt organization. Firstly, Jose Gamboa became a member of Infraud in December 2010 and advertised as vendor of custom-built ATM skimmers within the Infraud forum. Secondly, Valerian Chiochiu advised other members on the development and use of malware. He also developed malware that was used by other members to gain unauthorized access to personal and financial data and access device data. The illegally obtained information would then be sold on the Infraud forum to other Infraud members. The defendant also fraudulently purchased gift cards which were then sold on the Infraud forum to members for a profit.",participation in organized criminal group,0
"The defendant in this Case in front of the United States District Court of Columbia, led the largest Pakistani migrant smuggling operation at the time of the life of the conspiracy. Throughout his 2-year prolonged criminal activity, the defendant has procured the illegal entry of between twenty-five to ninety-nine smuggled migrants. The journey of the migrants began in Pakistan, continued through Central America with the final destination being the United States of America. In March 2014, Agents of the United States Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement “ICE” were informed of the ongoing migrant smuggling operation into the United States. In July 2015, Agents of the “ICE” were tasked with this operation and conducted interviews with smuggled migrants who identified the defendant as their smuggler. Based on extensive information gained through the interviews with the smuggled migrants and complemented by other sources, the US gathered sufficient evidence for extradition of the defendant to the States to stand trial at the US District Court of Columbia.The evidence submitted by the US government suggests that the defendant abused the migrants' vulnerable position by taking away their passport upon arrival in a safe house in Brazil. From that moment on, the defendant restricted migrants' ability to move, and the defendant completely controlled their movement throughout the journey.Additionally, the evidence suggests that the majority of the migrants smuggled by the defendant were in an economically deprived situation due to spending most, if not all, of their savings for paying a 'handsome' price for the defendant's smuggling service. The Court emphasizes that despite the large sum of money the defendant asked for each smuggled migrant to pay, which was between 3.000-15.000$ per individual, the smuggled migrants endured months of life-threatening, uncertain travel throughout Central America by land, air and sea. The average journey of a migrant smuggled by the defendant took up to 9 months. The Case discusses that on their crossing to the States, the smuggled migrants, with their genders undisclosed by the Court, were forced to spend days in crowded boats while crossing through Columbia. Throughout the migrants' journeys through Central American countries and their stays in safe-houses in El Salvador, Panama, Guatemala, Argentina and several other countries - the smuggled migrants continuously spent their life in uncertainty. Every next step on the journey wholly depended on the defendant's ability to pay his co-conspirators to facilitate their movement. The defendant, hereby, worked with several co-conspirators, who were located throughout countries in Central America, in a hierarchical manner, of which he was the leader of. His co-conspirator facilitated the smuggled migrants' movement, managed safe houses at various locations (e.g. Guatemala, Panama) and fulfilled other organizational tasks over which the defendant had full authority over.  The smuggled migrants furthermore faced with passages through the jungle in the Darien Gap, a place known for harsh and life-threatening conditions. Throughout their route through the jungle, witnesses report little, if any access to food and water. The defendant did not inform the smuggled migrants about the long and harsh conditions they would face on their way to the States.  The Court applied aggravating circumstances to the defendant's sentence due to his leadership role and his disregard of safety and security of the smuggled migrants throughout their journey.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"In or around July 2014, ALEXANDRE CAZES, aka ""ALPHA02,"" aka ""ADMIN,"" with· other persons, known and unknown to the. Grand Jury, created AlphaBay (also referred to as the ""AlphaBay Market""), a dark-web marketplace designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. The site also enabled users to purchase and sell illegal services, including “tumbling” and “mixing” services, which are forms of money laundering used for digital currencies.From its official launch in December 2014 AlphaBay was used by thousands of vendors to distribute controlled substances and other illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars deriving from these illegal transactions. AlphaBay also provided a private, internal messaging service through which staff, vendors, and buyers could communicate, as well as an associated web forum called the ""AlphaBay Market Forum."" On 1 June 2017, an arrest warrant would be issued for Alexandre CAZES that would be satisfied approximately one month later on 5 July 2017.

"This case involves several cyber and organized crime related offences of the creator of Silk Road, a massive online marketplace which sold illicit goods and services, in particular drugs. The defendant, Ross William Ulbricht, created Silk Road in January 2011, and owned and operated the website until it was shut down by law enforcement authorities in October 2013.The defendant deliberately operated Silk Road as an online criminal marketplace with the intent to facilitate its users to buy and sell illegal goods and services anonymously and under the radar of law enforcement. The defendant aimed at anonymizing transactions on Silk Road by operating Silk Road on “The Onion Router,” or “Tor” network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed around the world, designed to conceal the true IP addresses, and hence identities of its users; and by including a Bitcoin-based payment system that concealed the identities and locations of the users.The defendant controlled and oversaw every aspect of Silk Road, and managed a staff of paid, online administrators and computer programmers who assisted with the day-to-day operation of the site.  The defendant reaped commissions worth over USD 13 million generated from the illicit sales conducted through the site.The U.S. government learned of Silk Road in 2011, after intercepting a drug package in Chicago's O'Hare airport, and commenced an investigation into the online marketplace. Agents discovered that the Silk Road was run and managed by someone with the screen name of “Dread Pirate Roberts” (D.P.R.). In 2012, law enforcement agents investigated several individuals believed to be “Dread Pirate Roberts,” including Ross Ulbricht, Anand Athavale, and Mark Karpeles. Ultimately, Ulbricht became the primary suspect in 2013 after a series of “pen/trap” orders, which led U.S. law enforcement agents to collect evidence in the form of I.P. address data from Ulbricht’s home wireless network. Additional evidence came from undercover investigations, in which law enforcement agents took over low-level Silk Road administrators’ accounts and interacted with D.P.R. online, in an attempt to expose Ulbricht. In October 2013, at the San Francisco public library, agents arrested Ulbricht after catching him while he was logged in as the administrator of Silk Road and its D.P.R.The defendant was charged with and convicted of distributing narcotics, distributing narcotics by means of the Internet, conspiring to distribute narcotics, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit computer hacking, conspiring to traffic in false identity documents, and conspiring to commit money laundering. He was further accused of soliciting six murders-for-hire in connection with operating the site, although there was no evidence that these murders were actually carried out.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The defendant, Mr Steven W Chase, founded—and, between 19 August 2014 and 4 March 2015, was the lead administrator of—a website called ‘Playpen’ dedicated to the exchange of child pornography. The site enabled users to chat, exchange, and purchase images of child sexual abuse content in an anonymous way.The site had more than 150,000 users from around the world and was believed by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to be the world’s largest child pornography website. The content of the website was divided into different ‘boards’ categorised according to the age and sex of the victims and the type of sexual activity involved.Following a slip up by Chase in December 2014, Playpen’s unique IP address was exposed to a foreign law enforcement agency. The IP address was revealed to be in the US, and the law enforcement agency notified the FBI.In January 2015 the FBI, in partnership with the US Department of Justice’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, launched ‘Operation Pacifier’, which sought to identify the members of the Playpen website and bring them to justice.On 19 February 2015, the FBI executed a search warrant of Mr Chase’s home and Mr Chase was arrested. Forensic examination of a computer and devices seized during the search found thousands of images of child exploitation material.On 16 September 2016, a federal jury found Mr Chase of multiple charges relating to child pornography and child exploitation. On 1 May 2017 he was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment for these offences.Two other men, Messrs Michael Fluckiger, 46, of Indiana, United States of America, and David Browning, 47, of Kentucky, United States of America, also acted as administrators of the Playpen website.

"This case involves the defendant Yiwei Zheng who engaged in more than 300 sales and earned more than USD 1 million from wildlife trafficking and trade in elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn. Yiwei Zheng operated an online business known as Crouching Dragon Antiques. As part of this business, the defendant sold a variety of items, including some made of elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn.On 5 May 2011, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in Chicago identified one of the defendant’s parcels destined for an individual in Shanghai, China. An agent from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) inspected the package and found multiple elephant ivory carvings. Potentially in order to avoid apprehension, the defendant lied when listing the contents of packages containing CITES-protected elephant ivory or rhinoceros horn and declared the value of the packages to be far below their actual value. In this instance, the accompanying Customs Declaration and Dispatch Note completed by the shipper read “Chinese artifact: Desk Decorative item” and declared a value of USD 35.00. The ivory had not been declared to the USFWS nor had the defendant obtained any Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) permits for the ivory being exported as required.In the course of the investigation, it was determined that the elephant ivory items found in the intercepted shipment were acquired via the online auction site eBay for USD 6,961.41. The agents further documented that the defendant purchased two rhinoceros horns from a seller in Florida for more than USD 20,000 in July 2010, which he subsequently smuggled from the U.S. to China where the items were sold at an auction for about USD 68,000. In total, agents documented that the defendant smuggled into and out of the United States and sold in China and elsewhere, elephant ivory, rhinoceros horn and products with a value over USD 1,000,000.The defendant was indicted on charges of conspiracy (one count), smuggling (three counts), violations of the Lacey Act (one count), and false statements (one count).

The defendants, both Malaysian citizens and owners of an online business Borneo Artifact, a Malaysian-based retailer and wholesaler of exotic wildlife specimens and decorative artifacts derived therefrom, were arrested by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) on 4 December 2015.According to the criminal complaint, the investigation into the defendants began in 2013, when a routine search of an international package revealed a helmeted hornbill. Helmeted hornbills are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and a species protected under federal law and international treaty, bound for a residence in Forest Grove, Oregon.USFWS agents initiated an undercover operation named “Operation Pongo,” which was inspired by the orangutan’s genus Pongo, which received assistance from the Office of International Affairs, Environmental Crimes Section of the Environment and Natural Resources Division, U.S. Department of State, FBI Legal Attaché in Kuala Lumpur, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Bureau of Land Management, and the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office. USFWS records indicate that the defendants sold wildlife items to multiple individuals and businesses. Undercover USFWS agents posed as consumers who were interested in purchasing three orangutan skulls, four helmeted hornbill skulls, one CITES-protected rhino hornbill head, one ESA-protected babirusa (wild pig) skull, one CITES-protected langur skull, and one ESA-protected dugong (marine mammal) rib. Following the undercover sting operation, both defendants pleaded guilty on the charge of conspiracy to smuggle illegal goods into the U.S., and were sentenced in April 2016 to six months of imprisonment, 240 hours of volunteer community service, 1 year of supervised release, and a fine of USD 12,500.00 each.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"This case involves seven members of an organized criminal group that used the Domain Name System (DNS) Changer malware with co-conspirators to engage in a fraudulent advertisement scheme.The group posed as a legitimate Internet advertisement agency and entered into Internet advertising agreements where the defendants were paid to receive money each time a user clicked on a website link or advertisement. The defendants used rogue DNS servers and malware to fraudulently increase traffic, in turn increasing their revenue.  The malware would infect users’ systems, alter users’ DNS server settings to route activity to the rogue DNS servers, prevent anti-virus from receiving software updates, and facilitate click hijacking (i.e., where clicking on a search result redirects the user to the perpetrators’ desired site which the perpetrators receive payment for) and click fraud (i.e., fraudulently replacing advertisements on sites with desired advertisements that perpetrators receive payment for). To prevent detection from law enforcement and conceal the source of the proceeds of crime, one of the defendants was suspected of engaging in money-laundering activities by (attempting to) transport the proceeds out of the US.The defendants were charged in a 27-count-indictment in October 2011. Vladimir Tsastsin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit computer intrusion and was sentenced to 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment with one year of supervision after release and was required to forfeit USD 2.5 million. Other co-conspirators also pleaded guilty and were sentenced for their crimes, including Timur Gerassimenko and Valeri Aleksejev, 4 years’ imprisonment each; Dmitri Jegorov, 3 years and 8 months’ imprisonment; Konstantin Poltev, 3 years and 4 months’ imprisonment; and Anton Ivanov to time served.

"Carlos Rafael, a U.S. citizen originally from Portugal, owned one of the largest commercial fishing enterprises in the United States. Headquartered in New Bedford, Massachusetts, he was the sole shareholder of Carlos Seafood and owned over 30 fishing boats, of which he used to employ people and sustain his business. Rafael had been known to federal law enforcement authorities in the U.S. for a significant amount of time prior to his most current offenses after having been subjected to numerous criminal investigations dating back to the 1980s. Convicted two out of three times on charges which included tax evasion and false statements, Rafael had been previously incarcerated.During the time he owned his business, Rafael had conspired with multiple people to intentionally lie to federal government agencies about both the amounts of and species of fish he caught so that he could subvert laws and regulations set forth by the National Marine Fisheries Service, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States, concerning fish catching quotas. This was a plan to bring in more profit and personally enrich himself. Throughout the duration of his scheme, Rafael conspired to conceal and launder money acquired from his illegal catches of fish with the help of another business owner located in New York City while at the same time illegally transferring large sums of illegally obtained and illicit money from the United States to Portugal with the help of a law enforcement officer working in Logan International Airport.In January of 2015, Rafael decided it was time to sell his successful business. Responding to a newspaper article about Rafael's endeavor to sell the business, undercover Internal Revenue Service agents assumed the guise of a broker and two Russian immigrants with ties to organized criminal activity who wanted to buy the business. During the course of negotiations about the sale of the business, the undercover agents recorded Rafael speaking about his criminal activity in great detail. Rafael admitted to intentionally falsifying information on federal forms on a consistent basis with the help of an employee who worked in his New Bedford office related to the details of the fish he was catching and selling. Rafael consistently misreported and misrepresented the total amounts of and species of fish he was catching by hundreds of thousands of pounds on fishing trip reports and dealer reports, mandatory information to be submitted to the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration online. He would lie and and say he had caught fish that were subject to more lenient quotas than the ones he actually caught. Rafael would then be fronted cash by Michael Perreti, a business owner based in New York City, on a consistent basis in exchange for Rafael hiring a delivery truck service to bring his illegally caught fish to Perreti in New York City almost daily.Carlos Rafael made significant profits and was able to conceal a substantial amount from the government of the United States throughout the time period he was involved in this unlawful scheme. He laundered money with the help of Perreti and then illegally transferred it to Portuguese bank accounts with the help of Antonio Freitas, who was working as a Customs and Border Patrol Agent at Logan International Airport in Boston. Rafael and Freitas, who enlisted the help of his fiancé, routinely conspired to smuggle amounts of cash in excess of $10,000 to Portugal without declaring it to the United States, a punishable offense.After a thorough investigation by law enforcement in which this information was uncovered, Carlos Rafael and Antonio Freitas were charged in a 28 count indictment on May 4th, 2016 which included the offenses of Conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. §371, False Labeling and Identification in violation of 16 U.S.C. §§ 3372(d), 3373(d), Falsification of Federal Records in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1519, Bulk Cash Smuggling in violation of 31 U.S.C. §§ 5332(a), 5316, False Labeling and Fish Identification, Structuring Export of Monetary Instruments in violation of 31 U.S.C.§ 5324(c)(3), and Aiding and Abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. §2.In addition to the above charges, there were two criminal forfeiture allegations brought against the defendants: Criminal Forfeiture Allegation in violation of 16 U.S.C. § 3374(a), 28 U.S.C. § 2461(c) and Bulk Cash & Structuring Criminal Forfeiture Allegation in violation of 31 U.S.C. §§ 5317(c)(1), 5332(b)(2). Freitas went to trial and Raphael did not.As a result of the investigation into the organized criminal activity of Carlos Rafael and his various associates, which led to the aforementioned indictment and subsequent guilty plea to all 28 counts that he was charged with including Tax Evasion in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7201, the court sentenced Raphael to 46 months in prison. Rafael was also ordered to forfeit 4 of his fishing vessels and 34 fishing permits. It was further ordered that Rafael be given three years supervised release, a $200,000 fine, and a special assessment of $2,800 ($100 for each count he was charged with).",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The defendant, Su Bin, a national of China, was the owner and operator of an aviation and aerospace technology business. Between 2008 and 2014, the defendant and his two co-conspirators conspired to gain unauthorized access to computers and computer networks of U.S. defense contractors to obtain sensitive data and military data (including aviation data), which was subject to export controls, and provide this data to others located outside of the U.S. for financial gain. Specifically, on multiple occasions, the defendant’s co-conspirators, who were in China, gained unauthorized access to systems, retrieved proprietary data, showed the defendant what was accessed, and received guidance from the defendant on what information to obtain from the systems. The defendant also translated the data from English to Chinese. The co-conspirators used various techniques to surreptitiously access systems and networks to evade detection. In 2015, the defendant unsuccessfully fought his extradition to the United States. After his extradition to the United States, in 2016, the defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976. That same year, he was sentenced to 46 months’ imprisonment for his crimes.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"In approximately February 2010, defendants acquired a small wooden skiff on the coast of Somalia and loaded it with a hooked ladder and weapons, including AK-47 assault rifles, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher (an ""RPG""), a Singapore Assault Rifle 80 (an ""SAR-80""), and a Tokarev 9-mm pistol. They also equipped the skiff with two motors, enabling it to more swiftly traverse the sea. The group then left Somalia and travelled into the Gulf of Aden searching for a merchant ship to seize. The Gulf is one of the most heavily trafficked shipping corridors in the world, making it a prime location for piracy.On the afternoon of February 27, 2010, the skiff was intercepted in the Gulf of Aden by the HMS Chatham of the British Royal Navy. Upon encountering the skiff, the Chatham actioned a helicopter for a close investigation. The Somalis, recognizing the Chatham as a warship, attempted to flee in the skiff and threw weapons and their ladder overboard. Those actions were witnessed by the helicopter pilots, who conveyed information to a boarding team that had been dispatched in smaller boats from the warship.The HMS Chatham's boarding team seized and searched the skiff, where team members discovered the pistol and ammunition for that weapon and the AK-47s. The boarding team also apprehended and questioned the Somalis. The group's leader asserted that the Somalis were smugglers who had taken human cargo to Yemen and that one of their boats had broken down along the way. Personnel of the Chatham photographed the Somalis, confiscated the pistol and ammunition, disabled one of the skiff's motors, spray-painted a red identification number on the skiff, and ordered the Somalis to return home.In April 2010, the five defendants in this case, along with two others used the same skiff to enter the Gulf of Aden from Somalia. So that the skiff ""would not be recognizable,"" the Somalis had obliterated the identification number spray-painted on it by Royal Navy personnel. To accomplish their goal of seizing a ship, the Somalis had obtained a replacement for the disabled motor and loaded the skiff with a hooked ladder, three AK-47s, and an RPG.In the pre-dawn hours of April 10, 2010, the skiff swiftly approached a large ship believed by the Somalis to be a ""cargo ship."" Nearing the ship's aft on its port side, two defendants held loaded AK-47s, while one attempted to load the RPG with explosive rockets. When the skiff was approximately twenty-five yards from the ""cargo ship,"" one defendant began shooting at it with his AK-47. The Somalis intended to ""scare [the crew], and then after that[,] capture the ship."" The encounter took place about forty nautical miles off the coast of Yemen in international waters.The targeted ship was actually the USS Ashland, a dock landing ship of the United States Navy, which was then transiting the Gulf of Aden transporting Marines and military equipment. Several personnel aboard the Ashland—namely, Marine Lance Corporal John Curtis, Damage Control Fireman James Hendershot, Seaman Donald Lane, Lieutenant Junior Grade Benjamin Towers, Lieutenant Brent Holloway, and Gunner's Mate Justin Myers— witnessed the Somalis' attack from several vantage points, including near the warship's aft, its mid-ship, and the bridge. Several of the witnesses saw a defendant fire multiple rounds at the Ashland and heard bullets striking the ship. Corporal Curtis witnessed a defendant ""load a magazine, rack it, fire like two to three times, bang, bang, bang. Bang, bang. He dropped the magazine, loads another one, racks it a couple of times, keeps shooting, bang, bang, bang."" The multiple shots fired at the Ashland were so startling that the warship's helmsman had difficulty with the steering.Gunner's Mate Myers initially left his remote firing station inside the USS Ashland to observe the skiff's assault from the warship's deck. After watching a defendant fire multiple times at the Ashland, Myers ran back to his duty station, where he controlled 25-mm machine guns loaded with armor-piercing incendiary shells. The screen of the weapons system operated by Myers displayed images from an infrared camera mounted outside the ship. The camera zoomed in so closely on the skiff that it seemed ""[a]lmost as if you [were] standing next to some of the people in the skiff."". Myers's vantage point enabled him to see that the defendant in question was aiming directly at the Ashland. After a defendant began firing a second series of shots, the Ashland's Captain ordered Myers to return fire with a 25-mm machine gun, and Myers promptly fired two shots. As a result of those shots from the Ashland, a fire erupted on the skiff, one crew member died and a defendant lost his legThe defendants jumped off the burning skiff, throwing the RPG and two of the AK-47s overboard. While treading water, the Somalis agreed to tell the crew of the USS Ashland a story similar to the one that had been concocted for the personnel of the HMS Chatham—that the skiff was returning from smuggling refugees to Yemen. To explain why they were travelling on one small skiff, they would tell the Ashland's crew about transporting refugees on a second larger boat that had broken down before their return trip. The Somalis also agreed to explain that they were stranded without food or fuel, and that the deceased crew member had fired on the Ashland to alert the crew that they were in need of rescue.The USS Ashland and its personnel apprehended the defendants and Ibrahim, took pictures of the skiff's remains, and seized its contents, including the weapons and the hooked ladder that were left aboard. The Somalis were subsequently transported to Virginia, where this prosecution was initiated.",participation in organized criminal group,0
"This case concerned a number of drug charges against Jose Rodrigo Arechiga-Gamboa. Arechiga-Gamboa, also known as “Chino Antrax”, was a high-level member of the Mexico-based Sinaloa Cartel, an organized criminal group operating across multiple continents and countries, and known for its use of violence and threats to intimidate rival cartels.A press release from the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California noted that the Sinaloa Cartel imports large quantities of narcotics into Mexico from Asia and Central and South American countries including Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras and Guatemala. It noted further that the group uses various means of transportation to move narcotics, including cargo aircraft, private aircraft, submarines and other submersible and semi-submersible vessels, container ships, supply vessels, go-fast boats, fishing vessels, buses, rail cars, tractor trailers, trucks, automobiles, and private and commercial interstate and foreign carriers. According to the press release, the drugs are subsequently smuggled (often via tunnels) across the international border into the United States, more specifically San Diego, from where they are stored at various stash houses, safe houses and warehouses in San Diego County and later distributed nation-wide.On 20 December 2013, a federal grand jury returned an indictment and charged the defendant with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances intended for importation and conspiracy to import controlled substances. On the same day, a sealed warrant for his arrest was issued.On 30 December 2013, the accused was arrested as he disembarked a KLM flight from Mexico City at the Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, Netherlands, at the request of the United States, which had previously made formal requests for assistance from foreign authorities via a provisional arrest warrant and an Interpol Red Notice. Arechiga-Gamboa was traveling under a fraudulent Mexican passport, assuming the identity of a deceased individual, and having undergone significant plastic surgery and attempts to alter his fingerprints. Following his arrest, the US sought his extradition to face charges in California.Documents filed during extradition proceedings against Arechiga-Gamboa, alleged that he worked for the Sinaloa Cartel as a bodyguard and the leader of an enforcement group called “Los Antrax”. He was accused of providing security for narcotics shipments and conducting enforcement operations. Arechiga-Gamboa later rose to become one of the highest-level leaders of the cartel.On 28 May 2014, a Dutch court ordered the extradition of the defendant to the United States, where he arrived mid-July 2014.The defendant was accused of being part of an agreement between two or more persons to import cocaine and marijuana into the United States from a place outside thereof, beginning no later than in or about May 2005 and continuing up to and including 20 December 2013. He was tried at the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. On 20 May 2015, Arechiga-Gamboa entered a guilty plea, admitting to conspiracy to import cocaine and conspiracy to import marijuana and agreed to forfeit USD 1 million.",participation in organized criminal group,0
"The FBI’s Seattle Division conducted a joint investigation with the FBI Legal Attaché office in Bucharest, Romania and the Romanian Directiei Nationale Anticoruptie (DNA) involving the Nemes and their associates. The United States claims the Nemes were involved in a tax fraud scheme to avoid paying Romania 53 million Euro in excise taxes on imported diesel fuel. Their complaint alleges that the Nemes laundered the proceeds out of Romania, through multiple foreign accounts, and into the United States, where they ultimately purchased the properties at issue. When the scheme was discovered, the Nemes were extradited to Romania, where they were indicted for tax evasion and setting up an organized criminal group. The offenses are punishable up to eight and five years, respectively, not counting aggravating circumstances. The United States commenced this action to forfeit the real property the Nemes left behind, claiming it was used to conceal money laundering, international money laundering, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. These activities support forfeiture under this country’s criminal code. See 18 U.S.C. § 981(a)(1)(A). The United States initially relied on a different, bilateral treaty to justify this action. The Nemes filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the complaint was improperly based on the allegation that she had committed an offense extraditable under a bilateral treaty between the United States and Romania. She argued that only multilateral treaty offenses give rise to forfeiture. This Court agreed, but, because the defect was curable, granted the United States leave to amend. The United States filed an amended forfeiture complaint relying instead on UNTOC—a multilateral treaty. Nemes argues that forfeiture statutes must be strictly construed against the government, and that the money laundering statute upon which the United States relies does not apply to foreign tax evasion offenses. She claims that UNTOC applies only to “transnational” offenses— crimes committed in or affecting more than one State—and that none of the crimes Romania charged her with are transnational in nature.As explained in detail under the legal reasoning section, the court deemed tax evasion a serious crime worthy of extradition under UNTOC. Furthermore, it deemed the criminal activities of international money laundering as transnational in nature further saying that 'The fact that Nemes was not actually charged with money laundering in Romania is not the end of the inquiry. A criminal conviction is not required to proceed with a statutory in rem forfeiture.'Lastly, it ruled that the alleged crimes of setting up an organized criminal group and money laundering are both extraditable under UNTOC. The motion to dismiss was thus denied.",participation in organized criminal group,0
"This case was an appeal from a criminal proceeding brought against the defendant Adan Gutierrez-Mendez, also known as “Parajon.” In the trial court, the jury found the defendant guilty of conspiring to harbour illegal aliens and harbouring illegal aliens for commercial advantage or private financial gain. The defendant appealed, challenging the admission of certain evidence, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the sentence.The case concerns the smuggling of two female migrants from Guatemala (Migrant 1 and Migrant 2). In a first attempt in early 2011, the two migrants managed to cross the U.S. border with the help of a smuggling organization. They were given the password “Parajon” in case they were questioned while traveling, but they were captured upon entry and deported back to Guatemala.In March 2011, the two migrants in question made a second attempt to enter the United States and were again given the same password “Parajon.” They first travelled to a stash house in Mexico, where they met a man called “Beto.” Beto told them that he supervised the stash houses in Mexico that belonged to Parajon. Later, Migrant 1 and Migrant 2 crossed the river on small rafts with a group of about twenty-five people. After the migrants reached a highway, they were picked up by a man in a truck. The man told the migrants that only the Parajon group would continue. The Parajon group, consisting of about twelve people, including Migrant 1 and Migrant 2, were then taken to a house.There were three women in the Parajon group ― Migrant 1, Migrant 2, and an injured woman travelling with her family. The person in charge of the house instructed all three women to get ready to leave. While the injured woman stayed behind with her family, Migrant 1 and Migrant 2 were picked up by Beto. Beto told Migrant 1 that “she would need to ‘behave’ if she wanted things to continue to go well.” He then drove them to a trailer about twenty minutes away and introduced them to the defendant and a man named “Chano.” They were informed that the defendant was the boss of all the smuggling houses in the United States.Migrant 1 and Migrant 2 were told that they would leave the next morning at four o’clock. The defendant said that he would go ahead of the group and act as a lookout. He asked Migrant 2 whether she had paid the money she owned for her first entry and told her that she now owed them $6,000.The two women were then given several alcoholic drinks. The defendant told them to tell him “if the other men did not respect them,” because the defendant was “the boss” of the group. Later that night, the two women were separated from one another and sexually assaulted by Beto and Chano who threatened them with a knife.The next morning, Migrant 1 was informed that the plan had changed. They would go to the next stop the next day instead. After the three men left the trailer, the two women fled to a nearby house and told the owner of the house that they were threatened and kidnapped. Migrant 1 called her brother, who called the police to his house. They then reported to the police what had happened and pointed out the location of the trailer on GPS.In the appeal, the defendant challenged a piece of evidence introduced during the trial, which suggested that he had been involved in human smuggling since 2009. In 2009, two aliens from Mexico were found in the defendant’s vehicle during a traffic stop. The defendant was nevertheless not arrested or prosecuted for any crime regarding the 2009 incident.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The defendant (Binh Thanh Le), a vendor on the darknet Wall Street Market (“Eastsidehigh”), and his two co-conspirators (Steven McCall and Allante Pires), were charged “with conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess with the intent to distribute” drugs, such as MDMA and ketamine, in violation of U.S. law. The defendant’s operations were revealed pursuant to U.S. postal service and other law enforcement investigations. The defendant received wholesale drugs and related raw materials, processed these drugs and/or manufactured drugs based on raw materials, and shipped them to buyers by postal service.  A search of the defendant’s home revealed packages with vacuum sealed bags containing drugs that had been purposely mislabeled (“Lego box for kids”). Border security agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection also intercepted packages from the defendant and co-conspirators, which contained illicit drugs. The defendant “pleaded guilty to conspiracy to manufacture, distribute and possess with intent to distribute” drugs and was required to forfeit over 59 bitcoin, USD 114,680, the proceeds from the sale of his vehicle, his currency counter, and pill press.

"Aaron Michael Shamo ran a drug trafficking organization, of which the other five defendants were members, that imported controlled substances, such as fentanyl and alprazolam, from China and used the narcotics to produce fake oxycodone pills made with fentanyl and counterfeit Xanax tablets, which were subsequently sold on the Darknet marketplace AlphaBay using the vendor name “PHARMA-MASTER”. Shamo, through his organization, sold 1 million fentanyl-laced fake oxycodone pills to buyers in the United States, who were not aware of the falsification. Ultimately, Shamo was charged and convicted for running, organizing, supervising, and directing a continuing criminal enterprise that imported and distributed controlled substances. Likewise, the other five members of the continuing criminal enterprise that were indicted, were also charged with various drug-related offences (such as conspiracy to distribute fentanyl and conspiracy to distribute alprazolam) and/or conspiracy to commit money laundering and all entered plea agreements. Shamo, on the other hand, was ultimately convicted by a jury for“engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, three counts of aiding and abetting the importation of a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, manufacture of a controlled substance, …two counts of knowing and intentional adulteration of drugs while held for sale…[,] aiding and abetting the use of the U.S. mail in furtherance of a drug trafficking offence, conspiracy to commit money laundering, money laundering promotion and concealment, and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity.”For his crimes, Shamo was sentenced to life in prison.",drug offences,1
"The defendant Anthony Blane Byrnes conspired with an organized criminal group (i.e., a regional drug trafficking organization) to possess with the intent to distribute controlled substances, such as stimulant and hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., DMT, LSD, MDMA/Ecstasy, etc.) among other forms of illicit drugs.  According to the criminal complaint, he came to the attention of law enforcement authorities when U.S. Customs and Border Protection intercepted a package from Slovenia that was addressed to the defendant.  The package was found to contain narcotics. Law enforcement arranged for the controlled delivery of the package to the defendant’s address. After law enforcement observed the defendant collecting the package and bringing the package into his residence, they executed a search warrant for the residence of the defendant.  During the search of the defendant’s residence, they found and seized different forms of illicit drugs, as well as a firearm and ammunition. The defendant revealed to law enforcement authorities that the illicit drugs were purchased via the Empire Market darknet site. The defendant also revealed that he facilitated the purchase of illicit drugs with Bitcoins and used his cell phone and phone applications like Snapchat to communicate with co-conspirators and otherwise facilitate drug trafficking. The court documents further reveal that Byrnes had a previous infraction in April 2019, wherein law enforcement likewise confiscated narcotics and a firearm. He  ultimately pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 5 years and 11 months’ imprisonment.",drug offences,1
"This case involved Bryan Connor Herrell, an “employee” of the dark net site “AlphaBay” who was involved in moderating thousands of illegal transactions under various monikers, including “Penissmith” and “Botah.” From 2016 through July 2017 AlphaBay was the world’s largest online black market, and shortly before its shut down in 2017 it hosted approximately 368,810 listings for the sale of various illicit goods, approximately 350,000 active buyer accounts, and over 9,000 active vendor accounts.AlphaBay was created by Alexandre Cazes, who was prosecuted separately before committing suicide while in custody, in or around July 2014. The marketplace was designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. Numerous vendors used AlphaBay to distribute controlled substances and illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars gained from these illegal transactions. At the time of writing, the site is known to have facilitated the distribution in excess of 90kg of heroin, 450kg of cocaine, and 45kg of methamphetamine.The only way to access AlphaBay was through The Onion Router (“Tor”) network. This network anonymized the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of its underlying servers and allowed vendors and buyers to hide their true identities. Additional measures were also taken to keep identities hidden as AlphaBay required its users to transact in digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum, and did not allow for transactions in official, government-backed currencies. By only accepting digital currencies, AlphaBay and its users were able to bypass the traditional financial systems. AlphaBay was set up like a conventional e-commerce website as a search tool allowed users to choose the type of illegal goods or services they wished to purchase, and users were able to sign up for free by choosing a screen name and password for their account. Furthermore, users could also search by price ranges, popularity of items, vendors, origin or shipping country, and payment types.The defendant Herrell and other co-conspirators (both known and unknown to the Grand Jury) were members and associates of AlphaBay. The marketplace operated as criminal enterprise with “employees” serving as security administrators, moderators, public relations specialists, and scam watchers (whose primary duty is to identify and remove fraudulent listings), meaning that leaders, members, and associates of AlphaBay had defined roles in the organization. The defendant in this case held the position of moderator from about May 2016 through July 2017. As moderator, Herrell had access to portions of the AlphaBay platform that were not available to the general public and had the authority to refund payments from buyers on the website, restore a user’s access to the site, engage in staff-only discussions and meetings, and view the amount of digital currency available to other members of the AlphaBay organization. Moderators also held the responsibility of moderating disputes between buyers and vendors on AlphaBay. For his work as a moderator, Herrell was paid four bitcoins per week (bitcoin was worth about USD 2,000 per coin in May 2016, and about USD 2,600 in July 2017). Through moderating disputes, the defendant Herrell had full visibility and awareness of the criminal activities occurring on AlphaBay and therefore held a role in directly facilitating these criminal activities. In addition, Herrell also held the position of scam watcher from around August 2015 to December 2015, where he monitored and quashed phishing attempts and other scams being carried out on AlphaBay. Herrell was also paid in bitcoin for this work.In 2017, Bryan Connor Herrell was indicted on the felony crime of Conspiracy to Engage in Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, USD 250,000 criminal fine, and up to 3 years supervised release. Additionally, upon conviction of this offence, Herrell also was subject to a forfeiture of property pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1963(a)(1) - (a)(3). Herrell entered into a plea agreement and was sentenced to 11 years in prison in September 2020. The following assets were forfeited: one cryptocurrency wallet containing approximately one Bitcoin, an assortment of counterfeit “Magic: The Gathering” and sports collectible cards, approximately USD 745.00 in U.S. currency, 139 gold coins (one ounce each), 8 silver dollar coins (one ounce each), one USD 1,000 bill encased in hard plastic, and one German August Schwer Cuckoo clock.",drug offences,1
"This case involves the prosecution of members and leaders of “Clan Rincon,” one of the largest and most powerful emerald-mining families and criminal organizations in Boyacá, Colombia. Its principal leadership is composed of the brothers Pedro Nel Rincon-Castillo, Omar Josue Rincon-Castillo, and Gilberto Rincon-Castillo, part of the Rincon-Castillo family. They own emerald mines in Boyacá (most of the world’s emeralds come from Boyacá) and hold significant political and economic influence in the region. Other members of the Clan Rincon include Horacio De Jesus Triana-Romero, another well-known emerald mine owner and Jose Rogelio Nieto-Molina, former mayor of Coper, Boyacá.During the early 2000s, the left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC) began to expand their territorial control into Boyacá, taxing cocoa farmers, drug laboratory owners, and emerald mine owners. Historically, emerald mine owners in the region, including the Clan Rincon, have sold minority shares to local drug traffickers or representatives at inflated prices for them to launder illicit proceeds in addition to receiving certain protection at the mines. Therefore, to address the FARC threat, the Clan Rincon engaged a minority shareholder Yesid Nieto that had relations with the right-wing paramilitary and drug trafficking group the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, AUC) to bring the AUC to repel FARC presence. Consequently, the AUC managed to fight off the FARC and in exchange for their continued protection services, the Clan Rincon proposed they could tax cocoa farmers and drug laboratory owners, excluding emerald mine owners. With this relationship in place, it facilitated drug laboratories and traffickers, including the Clan Rincon throughout 2002 to 2015 to produce cocaine under the protection of the AUC, which ultimately resulted in the exportation of thousands of kilograms for eventual entry in the United States of America.On 28 July 2017, the aforementioned Clan Rincon members and in particular the leader Pedro Nel Rincon-Castillo, were indicted by the United States District Court of the Southern District of Florida. Defendants were indicted for their involvement in drug trafficking operations for the period 2002 throughout 2015, when they knowingly and wilfully conspired to distribute five (5) or more kilograms of cocaine to the United States of America – a controlled substance in Schedule II – in violation of Title 21, United States Code Section 960(b)(1)(B) and 963. They were later extradited from Colombia to the United States.On 15 November 2019, Jose Rogelio Nieto-Molina was sentenced to 14 years in prison. On 6 January 2020, Pedro Nel Rincon-Castillo and his brother Omar he entered a guilty plea, and was convicted for conspiring to distribute cocaine. On 16 March 2020 they were sentenced to 19 years and seven months in prison and 17 years and six months respectively, both followed by 5 years of supervised released. Horacio De Jesus Triana-Romero and Gilberto Rincon-Castillo were scheduled to be sentenced on 28 April and 4 May 2020 respectively. At the time of writing no information on the sentences of these defendants is available.",drug offences,1
"Baktash Akasha Abdalla and his brother, Ibrahim Akasha Abdalla, were the leader and deputy of a sophisticated international drug trafficking network, responsible for tonnes of narcotics shipments throughout the world. For over twenty years, they manufactured and distributed drugs and engaged in acts of violence toward those who posed a threat to their enterprise. When the brothers encountered legal interference, they bribed Kenyan officials—including judges, prosecutors, and police officers—to avoid extradition to the United States.The brothers, along with two associates, were arrested in Mombasa, Kenya by Kenyan Anti-Narcotics Unit officers in 2014, after providing 99 kilograms of heroin and two kilograms of methamphetamine to confidential sources posing as representatives of a South American drug cartel at the direction of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Following the arrests and pending extradition proceedings, the Akasha brothers continued criminal operations, using profits to bribe Kenyan officials. Their bribery scheme was frustrated in 2017 when the brothers were expelled from Kenya, and DEA agents took them to the United States for prosecution. The DEA praised the work of its Kenyan law enforcement counterparts and the government of Kenya.On October 24, 2018, Baktash and Ibrahim Akasha pled guilty in a United States Federal Court to conspiring to import and importing heroin and methamphetamine, conspiring to use and carry machine guns and destructive devices in connection with their drug-trafficking crimes, and obstructing justice. In August 2019, Baktash was convicted to 25 years in prison. In January 2020, his brother Ibrahim received a sentence of 23 years in prison.",drug offences,1
"Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator Brandon Arias used the moniker “The Drug Llama” on a vendor account on Dream Market (a Darknet site) to sell counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl. Melissa Scanlan was responsible for sourcing the drugs that would be sold using via the vendor account, while Brandon Arias was responsible for receiving and fulfilling Darknet drug orders, as well as the management of the account. Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator received fentanyl and other narcotics from Mexico, predominantly from Fausto Ramirez and another (unnamed) member of the Mexican cartel. After Melissa Scanlan and Brandon Arias sold the drugs, they kept a portion of the proceeds and gave the remaining criminal proceeds to couriers (usually Norma Dominguez and April Kelly, both females). The couriers would transport the proceeds across U.S.-Mexican border and deliver them to Fausto Ramirez and another member of a Mexican cartel. In one year alone, an estimated 52,000 counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl pills were sold.Melissa Scanlan was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, misbranding of drugs, international money laundering conspiracy, and distribution of fentanyl resulting in death. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 13 years and 4 months’ imprisonment.Brandon Arias was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, and misbranding of drugs. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 9 years’ imprisonment.",drug offences,1
"This case involves Gary Davis, a member of the small administrative “staff” of the Darknet marketplace “Silk Road.” During its operation from 2011 until 2013, Silk Road was used to distribute illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to more than 100,000 buyers, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of proceeds of these illicit transactions.From June to 2 October 2013, Davis, also known under his alias “Libertas,” worked as a site administrator on Silk Road. He was responsible for responding to customer support requests regarding the need for assistance with buyer or seller accounts, serving as an arbitrator by resolving disputes between drug dealers and their customers, and enforcing the rules for doing business on Silk Road, such as the rule against out of escrow sales. Davis was paid a weekly salary for his administrative services on the marketplace.Shortly after law enforcement authorities had shut down Silk Road in October 2013, its virtually identical successor, Silk Road 2.0, emerged. Davis also served as an administrator for the successor website from November to December 2013.The defendant, along with two of his co-conspirators, was charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy on 19 December 2013. Davis was arrested in Ireland in January 2014 and extradited to the United States in July 2018. Davis pleaded guilty to narcotics trafficking conspiracy on 5 October 2018 and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release on 25 July 2019. He was further ordered to forfeit USD 25,000. At the time of writing, no official information is available on the convictions of his co-defendants, Andrew Michael Jones and Peter Phillip Nash.",drug offences,1
"The defendant, Mr Gary Davis (aka “Libertas”) worked for the Silk Road website from June 2013 until 2 October 2013 (when the website was shutdown).Silk Road was an online black market created by Mr Ross Ulbricht where a wide range of illegal goods and services could be bought and sold. The platform resembled other online market places in that it required a username and password to log in, offered users a “shopping cart”, and had other like features). A variety of illicit drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy, and opioids were available for purchase on the website. The drugs purchased on Silk Road caused real harm—drugs purchased on Silk Road resulted in six deaths for overdose (though there is no suggestion that Mr Davis was responsible for any of these deaths). Counterfeit and fraudulent identity documents were also available for sale on the website—including, for instance, counterfeit US and foreign passports, US and foreign drivers’ licenses, and social security cards. Computer hacking tools and services were also available for purchase on Silk Road, including password hacking tools and services, Remote Access Tools (RAT) which allows users to obtain unauthorised remote access to a compromised computer, keyloggers which permit a user to monitor keystrokes inputted by a victim into his or her computer and used to steal confidential information, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) services which disable websites or other publicly available services on the Internet by using large networks of compromised computers to flood victim systems with malicious internet traffic. Finally, Silk Road offered money laundering services to its users, many of which were directly marketed to vendors who sold goods or services on the website. Money laundering services aimed at converting proceeds of illegal transactions (obtained in Bitcoin, the required means of payment on the Silk Road website) into other forms of currency. Vendors in this category offered, among other things, the sale of US currency, anonymous debit cards preloaded with currency and other prepaid payment systems, such as Moneypak cards.Silk Road was only accessible through the Tor network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed round the work and designed to conceal the true IP of the computers on the network and, thereby, the identities of users.The required and only payment system on Silk Road was Bitcoin—an entirely electronic currency, not issued by any bank or state, generated and controlled automatically through computer software operating on a peer-to-peer network, and operated through blockchain stored on the peer-to-peer network. On Silk Road, every user had one (or more) Silk Road Bitcoin address associated with their own Silk Road account. The Bitcoin address could be used by each user to deposit funds into their Silk Road account. These addresses were stored on “wallet” files maintained on computer servers controlled by Mr Ulbricht. To make purchases on the website, therefore, a user had to first obtain Bitcoin (for example, from a Bitcoin exchanger) and send these to a Bitcoin address associated with the user’s Silk Road account. Once the purchase took place, the funds were debited from the user’s Silk Road account and held in escrow in a wallet file maintained by Silk Road pending completion of the transaction. Once the transaction was completed the vendor’s Silk Road account would be credited with the payment minus the commission Silk Road took on the sale (8–15% of the transaction). The vendor would then withdraw the Bitcoins from his Silk Road account by transferring them to an outside Bitcoin address, such as the address of a Bitcoin exchanger who would cash out the Bitcoins for real currency. The vendors would also convert their Bitcoins into other currencies, by using money laundering services offered on the website.Silk Road would also use a so-called “tumbler” to hinder the tracking of individual transactions through the blockchain. In a nutshell, the “tumbler” would obscure any link between both the buyer’s and the vendor’s Bitcoin addresses. It would, therefore, make the use of blockchain to follow the money trail useless, even if both the vendor’s and buyer’s Bitcoin addresses were known.Mr Ulbricht ran the website with some support staff (they were four when Silk Road was shutdown by law enforcement on 2 October 2013), who were divided into forum moderators and site administrators. Forum moderators were responsible for, among other things, monitoring user activity on discussion forums associated with the site, providing guidance to forum users concerning how to conduct business on Silk Road, and reporting any significant problems discussed on the forums to the site administrators and Mr Ulbricht. Site administrators were in charge of responding to customer support requests from Silk Road users who needed assistance with their buyer or seller accounts; investigating disputes that arose between vendors and buyers, including reporting their findings to Mr Andrew Michael Jones (another site administrator) or Mr Ulbricht; and helping enforce the rules for doing business on Silk Road. This last responsibility included demoting vendors or referring them to Mr Ulbricht for further discipline. This could happen when vendors and buyers would communicate on Silk Road and decide to conclude the sale offsite to avoid paying to Silk Road a commission (this was called “out of escrow” sales).Mr Gary Davis first worked for a month as a forum moderator of Silk Road. He then was “promoted” to site administrator. As a site administrator, he demoted an account that was likely compromised by the police and posted some posts on the forum advising users how to conceal their true identities. When Silk Road was shut down by law enforcement on 2 October 2013, Mr Davis helped with the launch of “Silk Road 2.0”, a website which was created in the month following Silk Road’s demise. Mr Davis used his credibility with the original Silk Road community to vouch for the new website. He worked on the new version of Silk Road as a site administrator for one month, until he was arrested in Ireland in January 2014.Mr Davis was extradited from Ireland to the US in July 2018. He pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to traffic a controlled substance (narcotics). He was sentenced to six years and six months’ imprisonment on 25 July 2019.",drug offences,1
"The defendant, Joaquin Archivaldo Guzman Loera, also known as ""El Chapo"", was, since 1994, a leader of the Sinaloa Cartel alongside Ismael Zambada Garcia. The Sinaloa Cartel was one of the most powerful drug trafficking organisations in Mexico.Guzman transported illicit drugs with the use of fishing boats, submarines, carbon fibre airplanes, trains with secret compartments and underground tunnels. Once the narcotics were in the United States, they were sold to wholesale distributors. Guzman then used various methods to launder billions of dollars of drug proceeds, including US-based insurance companies, reloadable debit cards, numerous shell companies, including a juice company and a fish flour company, and the smuggling cash in bulk from the United States to Mexico.Guzman was arrested in 2016 in Mexico and was extradited in 2017 to the US where he was convicted of continuing criminal enterprise; possession, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances; use of firearms; and laundering of monetary instruments and sentenced to life imprisonment on 17 July 2019.",drug offences,1
"Mr Vincent Ramos was the founder and CEO of a Canada-based company called Phantom Secure. Phantom Secure was founded by Mr Ramos, Mr Kim August Rodd and another individual in 2008. Phantom Secure sold custom, modified BlackBerry mobile phones. Additionally, Phantom Secure operated an encrypted network that allowed its devices to send and receive encrypted messages. Mr Ramos advertised Phantom Secure’s products as impervious to decryption, wiretapping or legal third-party records requests.According to Phantom Secure’s own marketing materials, the company purchased Blackberry handsets which it then modified to remove the hardware and software responsible for all external architecture, including voice communication, microphone, GPS navigation, camera, Internet and messaging services. It then installed an email program using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption software and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The email program routed its traffic through encrypted servers located in countries and jurisdictions believed by Phantom Secure to be uncooperative with law enforcement, such as Panama and Hong Kong SAR of China. The locations of Phantom Secure’s encrypted servers were also disguised through multiple layers of virtual proxy networks (VPNs). Clients of Phantom Secure were provided with custom email addresses for using the email program on Phantom Secure’s devices. Phantom Secure devices and services were provided to clients at a cost of approximately USD 2,000–3,000 per six-month subscription.According to an informant, Phantom Secure’s devices were specifically designed, marketed and distributed for use by transnational criminal organisations, specifically those involved in drug trafficking. According to law enforcement sources in Australia, Canada and the United States of America, Phantom Secure devices were used by senior members of numerous transnational criminal organisations to communicate with their criminal partners. These sources further stated that they were unaware of any law enforcement agency that had identified even a single legitimate Phantom Secure user. Phantom Secure devices were used to facilitate the distribution of wholesale quantities of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines throughout the world, including the United States of America, Australia, Mexico, Canada, Thailand and Europe.US authorities received intelligence that some members of the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico were users of Phantom Secure devices. Another example of a client of Phantom Secure was Mr Owen Hanson, who used six Phantom Secure devices to coordinate the transportation of more than a tonne of cocaine from Mexico into the United States of America and on to Canada and Australia.Phantom Secure did not sell its devices to the general public. Rather, the company operated on an exclusive referrals basis whereby a prospective client could not purchase a Phantom Secure device if they received a personal reference from an existing client. Phantom Secure not only verified the reference from the sponsoring client, but also conducted its own open-source checks to verify the prospective client’s identity. US authorities believed that the purpose of this procedure was to prevent law enforcement from penetrating Phantom Secure’s network.To protect clients’ identities, Phantom Secure did not request, track or record their clients’ real names or other identifying information, but rather interacted with them using usernames, email addresses, or nicknames.Phantom Secure routinely deleted and destroyed evidence from devices that it knew had been seized by law enforcement. Indeed, it guaranteed that clients’ messages would be remotely deleted if the device was seized by law enforcement or compromised.After a news article published on 5 March 2014 stated that law enforcement investigations of a gangland murder were frustrated because the suspects used Phantom Secure devices to coordinate the killing, Mr Ramos wrote that ‘this is the best verification on what we have been saying all along – proven and effective for now over nine years. It is the highest level of authority confirming our effectiveness. It can’t get better than that.’At the time of Mr Ramos’ arrest, one US government estimate ‘conservatively’ put the number of Phantom Secure devices in use at 7,000. Another estimate filed in the application for Mr Ramos’ arrest stated that there were more than 20,000 Phantom Secure devices in use worldwide, including approximately 10,000 in Australia.In pleading guilty to the charges against him, Mr Ramos admitted that at least 450 kilograms of cocaine were distributed using Phantom Secure devices, though the real amount would have been significantly larger. The US government stated that ‘the amount of drugs Phantom Secure aided and abetted in transporting by providing devices and services to criminals worldwide was too high calculate.’US authorities estimated that Phantom Secure generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue through the provision of its services. It believed that Phantom Secure laundered the proceeds of its device and services sales through several shell companies. Phantom Secure also used Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to launder its earnings.Organisational structureThe organisational structure of the Phantom Secure criminal enterprise included individuals with roles as administrators, distributors and agents. Administrators included Phantom Secure’s corporate executives and front office staff who had physical control of the Phantom Secure network, Phantom Secure’s books and records, and its corporate operations. Administrators could initiate new subscriptions, remove accounts and remotely wipe and reset devices. As the CEO of Phantom Secure, Mr Ramos was its lead administrator. Mr Rodd was also alleged to have served as an administrator of Phantom Secure. Individual A was also said to have held ‘an integral role in the design and maintenance of the security integrity’ of Phantom Security.Distributors coordinated agents and resellers of Phantom Secure devices and received payments for ongoing subscription fees, which they transferred, minus a personal commission, back to Phantom Secure. They also provided technical support and communicated directly with Phantom Secure administrators. Messrs Nasri, Poquiz and Gamboa were all alleged to have been distributors for Phantom Secure.Agents physically sourced and engaged with new customers to sell and deliver Phantom Secure devices. They earned a profit on the sale of the handset and provided first-level technical support to their customers.Arrest and indictmentThe case against Messrs Ramos, Rodd, Nasri, Gamboa and Poquiz stemmed from an investigation in the Southern District of California which related to a Phantom Secure client who used Phantom Secure devices to traffic thousands of kilograms of cocaine and other illicit substances around the world.On 28 February 2018, a warrant for Mr Ramos’ arrest was issued by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. On 7 March 2018, Mr Ramos was taken into custody in Bellingham, Washington, United States of America.Pursuant to an indictment filed 18 March 2015, Messrs Ramos, Rodd, Nasri, Gamboa and Poquiz were charged with racketeering conspiracies in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962 and conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841 and 846. The indictment also sought the forfeiture of USD 80 million as proceeds of crime, as well as specifically identified assets such as international bank accounts, real estate, cryptocurrency accounts, and gold coins.",drug offences,1
"While living in Pakistan in 2006, a man named Jaweed, who came from Afghanistan, fell in with a former Taliban officer also from Afghanistan, named Abdul Rahman. Rahman was planning an attack on a strategic NATO airbase in Eastern Afghanistan, the Jalalabad airfield. He ordered Jaweed to go back to his hometown Geratak in the Nangarhar province and contact Khan Mohammed, who was also involved in the plot. Jaweed followed the instructions and visited Mohammed, who ordered him to obtain missiles that would be used in the planned attack.However, Jaweed soon turned against the two and disclosed the plot to the Afghan police, who persuaded Jaweed to continue his role in the plan as their informant. The primary responsibility for the investigation was later turned over to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), with whom Jaweed collaborated as well. The DEA wired Jaweed and recorded numerous conversations with Mohammed between August and September 2006.In the first of the recorded conversations, Mohammed discussed details of the attack on the airfield and claimed that he had the same authority and purpose as Rahman. Having heard the plans, the DEA had first decided to arrest Mohammed soon after Jaweed had given him the missiles, but – concerned about losing control of the missiles – the DEA soon changed strategies and decided to arrest Mohammed for narcotics trafficking. For this reason, Jaweed told Mohammed about a friend looking for opium, to which Mohammed replied that he knew someone and could supply as much as this friend needed. Mohammed and Jaweed met three times to discuss the details, including the price and Mohammed’s commission. During these meetings plans for the attack on the airfield were also addressed, for instance Mohammed mentioned that they needed a car for the missiles and that he would use the profits from the drug sale to buy a car, which could also help carry out more sales.Regarding the opium deal, Jaweed and Mohammed went to a local bazaar where Mohammed negotiated the sale with his source.  On the following day, they went to the seller’s house, where Jaweed secretly recorded Mohammed inspecting, paying for, and taking away the opium, which he later sold to Jaweed. The DEA agents later told Jaweed to orchestrate another sale for heroin. Mohammed agreed to this idea and obtained almost two kilograms of heroin, which he then sold to Jaweed, who told him that his friend would be sending the opium and the heroin to the United States. Mohammed was pleased about this information, stating that their common goal was to eliminate the “infidels” either “by opium or by shooting”.On 29 October 2006, the DEA and the Afghan police arrested Mohammed. They blindfolded and handcuffed him and drove to the DEA base at the Jalalabad airfield, where he was briefly held in a detention cell without blindfold or handcuffs before he was taken into a room to be questioned. The questioning was conducted by three DEA agents, one of which was wearing a visible sidearm. The Miranda warnings were read by DEA Special Agent Jeffrey Higgins and translated into Pashto using an interpreter. Mohammed confirmed that he understood. A rights card or a waiver form were not used, since it was presumed that Mohammed was illiterate. Mohammed submitted to the questioning, which lasted two hours including a short break. Mohammed received food and water, a prayer rug and the opportunity to pray, and could use the bathroom. He wasn’t threatened during the interrogation, but one officer falsely told him that his hands had tested positive for heroin. In the end, the agents told the defendant that he was being charged with drug trafficking and narcoterrorism under U.S. law.On 13 December 2006, a federal grand jury indicted Khan Mohammed for distributing on kilogram or more of heroin intending or knowing that it will be unlawfully imported into the United States. He was extradited to the United States on 5 November 2007. On 13 January 2008,  the government filed a Superseding Indictment adding a second charge, namely distributing a controlled substance knowing or intending to provide anything of pecuniary value to a person and organization that has engaged or engages in terrorism or terrorist activity.",drug offences,1
"In or around July 2014, ALEXANDRE CAZES, aka ""ALPHA02,"" aka ""ADMIN,"" with· other persons, known and unknown to the. Grand Jury, created AlphaBay (also referred to as the ""AlphaBay Market""), a dark-web marketplace designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. The site also enabled users to purchase and sell illegal services, including “tumbling” and “mixing” services, which are forms of money laundering used for digital currencies.From its official launch in December 2014 AlphaBay was used by thousands of vendors to distribute controlled substances and other illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars deriving from these illegal transactions. AlphaBay also provided a private, internal messaging service through which staff, vendors, and buyers could communicate, as well as an associated web forum called the ""AlphaBay Market Forum."" On 1 June 2017, an arrest warrant would be issued for Alexandre CAZES that would be satisfied approximately one month later on 5 July 2017. CAZES was arrested during a raid on his home in Bangkok, Thailand and was held by the Royal Thai Police for approximately seven days before apparently committing suicide while in custody on 12 July 2017.

"This case involves several cyber and organized crime related offences of the creator of Silk Road, a massive online marketplace which sold illicit goods and services, in particular drugs. The defendant, Ross William Ulbricht, created Silk Road in January 2011, and owned and operated the website until it was shut down by law enforcement authorities in October 2013.The defendant deliberately operated Silk Road as an online criminal marketplace with the intent to facilitate its users to buy and sell illegal goods and services anonymously and under the radar of law enforcement. The defendant aimed at anonymizing transactions on Silk Road by operating Silk Road on “The Onion Router,” or “Tor” network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed around the world, designed to conceal the true IP addresses, and hence identities of its users; and by including a Bitcoin-based payment system that concealed the identities and locations of the users.The defendant controlled and oversaw every aspect of Silk Road, and managed a staff of paid, online administrators and computer programmers who assisted with the day-to-day operation of the site.  The defendant reaped commissions worth over USD 13 million generated from the illicit sales conducted through the site.The U.S. government learned of Silk Road in 2011, after intercepting a drug package in Chicago's O'Hare airport, and commenced an investigation into the online marketplace. Agents discovered that the Silk Road was run and managed by someone with the screen name of “Dread Pirate Roberts” (D.P.R.). In 2012, law enforcement agents investigated several individuals believed to be “Dread Pirate Roberts,” including Ross Ulbricht, Anand Athavale, and Mark Karpeles. Ultimately, Ulbricht became the primary suspect in 2013 after a series of “pen/trap” orders, which led U.S. law enforcement agents to collect evidence in the form of I.P. address data from Ulbricht’s home wireless network. Additional evidence came from undercover investigations, in which law enforcement agents took over low-level Silk Road administrators’ accounts and interacted with D.P.R. online, in an attempt to expose Ulbricht. In October 2013, at the San Francisco public library, agents arrested Ulbricht after catching him while he was logged in as the administrator of Silk Road and its D.P.R.The defendant was charged with and convicted of distributing narcotics, distributing narcotics by means of the Internet, conspiring to distribute narcotics, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit computer hacking, conspiring to traffic in false identity documents, and conspiring to commit money laundering. He was further accused of soliciting six murders-for-hire in connection with operating the site, although there was no evidence that these murders were actually carried out.",drug offences,1
"On 26 August 2007, Justus Cornelius Rosemond and two accomplices, Vashti Perez and Ronald Joseph, were involved in a drug transaction in a public park located in Tooele, Utah, United States of America. Perez brokered the sale of one pound of marijuana by Rosemond and Joseph, and transported the illegal narcotics across state jurisdiction from Texas. During the transaction the buyers, Cory Painter and Ricardo Gonzalez, met the three sellers in the park. Gonzalez entered the backseat of the vehicle where the transaction was occurring. Though the buyers intended to purchase marijuana, they did not have enough cash for the transaction. Instead, Gonzalez assaulted Rosemond and stole the marijuana. While Gonzalez and Painter fled from the vehicle, an unknown individual discharged a 9mm handgun from the car that Rosemond, Prez and Joseph were in. Approximately nine to ten shots were fired in the direction of Gonzalez and Painter. A state trooper from the Utah Highway Patrol, responding to 9-1-1 calls from bystanders who witnessed the shooting, stopped the vehicle carrying Rosemond, Perez, and Joseph. The vehicle matched the description provided on the 9-1-1 calls by witnesses. After gaining consent to search the car from Perez, the driver, no weapon or any other evidence providing probable cause was found. The state trooper terminated the search after finding no evidence and allowed the vehicle to leave the scene. Joseph later testified during the jury trial that the 9mm handgun was hidden under the back seat of the vehicle where Rosemond was sitting.Several days after the incident, Perez testified during law enforcement questioning that Rosemond was the individual who discharged the firearm during the drug transaction. Witnesses who were in the vicinity of the park during the shooting could not positively identify which individual fired the gun, only identifying that it came from the vehicle. Joseph testified under oath at trial that Rosemond was the shooter. Perez and Joseph were not prosecuted for their involvement in the crime due to an immunity agreement with prosecutors in exchange for testimony during the trial. Similarly, Gonzalez and Painter were also granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for their testimony. Rosemond was indicted on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, carrying a firearm during an in relation to drug trafficking, possession of ammunition by a convicted felon, and possession of ammunition by an unlawful alien.Rosemond was found guilty on all four counts and sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment.",drug offences,0
"This case concerned a number of drug charges against Jose Rodrigo Arechiga-Gamboa. Arechiga-Gamboa, also known as “Chino Antrax”, was a high-level member of the Mexico-based Sinaloa Cartel, an organized criminal group operating across multiple continents and countries, and known for its use of violence and threats to intimidate rival cartels.A press release from the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California noted that the Sinaloa Cartel imports large quantities of narcotics into Mexico from Asia and Central and South American countries including Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras and Guatemala. It noted further that the group uses various means of transportation to move narcotics, including cargo aircraft, private aircraft, submarines and other submersible and semi-submersible vessels, container ships, supply vessels, go-fast boats, fishing vessels, buses, rail cars, tractor trailers, trucks, automobiles, and private and commercial interstate and foreign carriers. According to the press release, the drugs are subsequently smuggled (often via tunnels) across the international border into the United States, more specifically San Diego, from where they are stored at various stash houses, safe houses and warehouses in San Diego County and later distributed nation-wide.On 20 December 2013, a federal grand jury returned an indictment and charged the defendant with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances intended for importation and conspiracy to import controlled substances. On the same day, a sealed warrant for his arrest was issued.On 30 December 2013, the accused was arrested as he disembarked a KLM flight from Mexico City at the Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, Netherlands, at the request of the United States, which had previously made formal requests for assistance from foreign authorities via a provisional arrest warrant and an Interpol Red Notice. Arechiga-Gamboa was traveling under a fraudulent Mexican passport, assuming the identity of a deceased individual, and having undergone significant plastic surgery and attempts to alter his fingerprints. Following his arrest, the US sought his extradition to face charges in California.Documents filed during extradition proceedings against Arechiga-Gamboa, alleged that he worked for the Sinaloa Cartel as a bodyguard and the leader of an enforcement group called “Los Antrax”. He was accused of providing security for narcotics shipments and conducting enforcement operations. Arechiga-Gamboa later rose to become one of the highest-level leaders of the cartel.On 28 May 2014, a Dutch court ordered the extradition of the defendant to the United States, where he arrived mid-July 2014.The defendant was accused of being part of an agreement between two or more persons to import cocaine and marijuana into the United States from a place outside thereof, beginning no later than in or about May 2005 and continuing up to and including 20 December 2013. He was tried at the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. On 20 May 2015, Arechiga-Gamboa entered a guilty plea, admitting to conspiracy to import cocaine and conspiracy to import marijuana and agreed to forfeit USD 1 million.",drug offences,0
"Petitioner, John Doe, a native and citizen of Ghana, was a lawful permanent resident of the United States when he was arrested after admitting he expected to receive a package addressed to him that contained a quantity of heroin. Following his arrest, Doe admitted to participating in an international drug smuggling ring. Doe cooperated with federal agents to arrange a controlled delivery of the heroin to another individual in this country. The controlled delivery led to the arrest of one of the individuals who had hired Doe to receive the heroin. That individual was ultimately convicted and imprisoned.Doe pled guilty to an information including a count related to his heroin smuggling activities. The Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear, alleging that Doe was removable from the United States based on his conviction for an aggravated felony and controlled substance offense. Doe's attorney inquired about an S visa, available to certain non-citizens who assist with criminal investigations, but the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to Doe's case elected not to request such a visa on Doe's behalf in exchange for his cooperation. In immigration court, Doe admitted the factual allegations in the Notice to Appear and conceded removability, but sought protection from removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (“CAT”) and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (CATOC).At the conclusion of the removal proceedings, the Immigration Judge denied Doe's request for protection under the CAT and noted that the request for protection under the CATOC was outside the immigration court's jurisdiction. Doe appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), raising his CAT and CATOC claims, as well as two new arguments based on the “state-created danger” doctrine and equitable estoppel. The BIA rejected all four claims and dismissed the appeal. The BIA concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider claims for relief under the CATOC because the Attorney General had not delegated authority over such requests to immigration judges or to the BIA.In this petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) decision, the court is asked to consider whether the protection of witnesses provisions of the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime are self-executing.The Court held that those provisions are not self-executing. Accordingly, the petition for review was DENIED",drug offences,0
"On October 26, 2011, the United States Coast Guard observed a vessel in the international waters off the eastern coast of Jamaica. While the Coast Guard was pursuing the vessel, the three individuals aboard the vessel discarded dozens of bales into the water, which the Coast Guard later determined to be approximately 997 kilograms of marijuana. The vessel lacked all indicia of nationality: it displayed no flag, port, or registration number. Glenroy Parchment identified himself as the master of the vessel and claimed the vessel was registered in Haiti. The Coast Guard then contacted the Republic of Haiti to inquire whether the vessel was of Haitian nationality. The government of Haiti responded that it could neither confirm nor deny the registry. The other two individuals aboard the vessel, Christopher Patrick Campbell and Pierre Nadin Alegrand, as well as Parchment later admitted that they knew they were illegally transporting marijuana.After a federal grand jury indicted Campbell, Alegrand, and Parchment under the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, 46 U.S.C. § 70501 et seq., for conspiracy to possess and for possession with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, id. §§ 70503(a)(1), 70506(a), 70506(b); 21 U.S.C. § 960(b)(2)(G), Campbell filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on three grounds: (1) that admission of a certification of the Secretary of State to prove a response to a claim of registry, see 46 U.S.C. § 70502(d)(2), would violate Campbell's right under the Confrontation Clause and that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Campbell was aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; (2) that the Act violated Campbell's right to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment because he had no contacts with the United States; and (3) that Congress exceeded its constitutional power to define and punish felonies committed on the high seas when it enacted the Act. Campbell conceded that our precedents foreclosed his last two arguments, but he stated his intent to preserve his objections for further review.The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge, who held a hearing about whether the certification of the Secretary of State established jurisdiction. At the hearing, the United States introduced into evidence the certification of the Secretary of State, which included the statement of Commander Daniel Deptula of the United States Coast Guard that he had contacted the Republic of Haiti to inquire whether the vessel was registered there and that Haiti responded that it could neither confirm nor deny the registry of the vessel. Campbell objected to the admission of the certification on the ground that it violated his right under the Confrontation Clause, but the magistrate judge overruled the objection because the certification was ""self-authenticating"" and ""whether there should be further proof beyond the State Department document is really a separate question and does not go to the admissibility of the certification."" The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the certification of the Secretary of State established extraterritorial jurisdiction over the vessel and that the Act was constitutional both on its face and as applied to Campbell. The district court adopted the report and recommendation.Campbell waived his right to a trial by jury in a written statement signed by him, his counsel, the prosecutor, and the district court judge, and at a bench trial, the parties stipulated to the material facts. But Campbell maintained at trial that the stipulation about the communication between Commander Deptula and Haiti proved only the representation by the Coast Guard that a Haitian official could neither confirm nor deny the registration of the vessel and not that the communication from a Haitian official actually occurred. Campbell acknowledged that the district court had already determined its jurisdiction based only on the certification of the Secretary of State, but he argued ""that there was nobody from Haiti that actually signed a certificate or provided any documents."" The district court found Campbell guilty on both the conspiracy and possession counts.",drug offences,1

"During a routine patrol of Panamanian waters in 2010, the United States Coast Guard observed a wooden fishing vessel operating without lights and without a flag. The Coast Guard informed the Panamanian National Aero-Naval Service of the vessel. The Panamanian Navy pursued the vessel until its occupants abandoned the vessel and fled into a jungle. When members of the Panamanian Navy searched the vessel the next morning, they discovered approximately 760 kilograms of cocaine. The Panamanian National Frontier Service searched on land for the occupants of the abandoned vessel and arrested the defendants in various locations on the beach and in the jungle. After an exchange of diplomatic notes, the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Panama consented to the prosecution of the four suspects in the United States.A federal grand jury indicted the defendants for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, and for actual possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. See 46 U.S.C. §§ 70503(a), 70506; 21 U.S.C. § 960(b)(1)(B). The defendants moved to dismiss the indictment ""based upon the lack of jurisdiction and the unconstitutionality of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act as applied to [their] conduct."" A magistrate judge recommended that the motion be denied. The magistrate judge reasoned that the district court had jurisdiction because the defendants were operating a stateless vessel and that the Act was constitutional as applied because Congress and several courts had determined that drug trafficking was ""universally condemned"" by various nations with ""reasonably developed"" legal systems. The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report. The district court also explained that section 70505 of the Act ""limits the actors that have standing to challenge the validity of an MDLEA prosecution on international law grounds.""The defendants conditionally pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge. The district court sentenced Mr Bellaizac-Hurtado to imprisonment for 90 months, supervised release for five years, and a $100 fine; Mr Angulo-Rodallega to imprisonment for 36 months, supervised release for two years, and a $100 fine; Mr Gonzalez-Valois to imprisonment for 36 months, supervised release for two years, and a $100 fine; and Mr Riascos-Hurtado to imprisonment for 25 months, supervised release for two years, and a $100 fine.

"The defendant, Arthur Webster Jr. a.k.a. “Jerry Starr”, operated several –at least seven- sham escort businesses that were in reality fronts for an illegal prostitution business in the Anchorage area of Alaska. Webster targeted and recruited vulnerable adult and minor females who were homeless, in low-paying jobs or runaways, and invited them to work for his purported ""escort services"", where an individual would supposedly pay for another person’s ""time and company."" The defendant, however, forced the victims to engage in prostitution.The defendant’s prostitution business operated on an “out call” basis, meaning that the clients would call the escort services’ phone lines, and in exchange for money, the defendant would provide adult women and underage girls who would meet the caller at his residence or at a hotel paid for by the caller to engage in sex acts. The callers would agree in advance to pay a fixed hourly rate plus a transportation fee in order to meet with a woman, and then would pay additional money in exchange for sex acts or drugs which Webster provided.The defendant provided housing for the girls and women he recruited at six homes in Anchorage. The defendant controlled the victims completely, with the purpose of ensuring their continued cooperation: he threatened them, took away their personal identification and other properties, forbid any interaction with persons outside of the organization, he threatened his victims and violently assaulted them if they tried to leave or disobeyed him. The victims were also required to give the defendant all of the money they earned. When they returned from a “date”, the defendant would take their earnings and give them an “issue”, which was approximately one gram of crack cocaine. In their testimonies, the victims recounted going on up to ten “dates” per day, every day, with no days off. Furthermore, all of the victims testified that they were addicted to crack cocaine at the time they were involved in Webster’s prostitution business.Moreover, Webster physically assaulted and abused the women in various ways. The victims testified that Webster would often assault one woman in front of the others to make an example of her. The victims also described being repeatedly choked, punched, slapped, bound and strip-searched by the defendant, or by someone acting at his direction. According to the victims’ testimonies, he also threatened to pour boiling water on one victim while another was in the room. In another incident, when one victim left the house, Webster found her and dragged her back by her hair. Two victims also described being locked in ""the box,"" a small crawl space or closet, as punishment for disrespecting him. Finally, several victims described a ""family"" meeting where Webster dragged one young woman into a room, out of the other victims’ sight. The witnesses said they could hear the sounds of the beating, and described how that woman emerged bruised and bloody, with chunks of her hair missing. One victim also affirmed that Webster had raped her, and several others testified that he insisted on having sex with them.",drug offences,1
"The description of the crimeOperations Smoking Dragon (in Los Angeles) and Royal Charm (in New Jersey) led to the indictment of 87 individuals from China, Taiwan, Canada, and the U.S. The investigations uncovered and dismantled an international smuggling ring that could have threatened the country’s national security. The smugglers conspired to smuggle massive quantities of counterfeit money, weapons, drugs, cigarettes and other contraband into the United States.Charges against the subjects included smuggling real and phony drugs and other contraband into the U.S. along with counterfeit $100 bills—believed to have been produced in North Korea—that were so nearly perfect and so much more sophisticated than typical counterfeit currency they were dubbed “Supernotes.” The conspirators also offered to smuggle a variety of Chinese military-grade weapons.",drug offences,0
"Both Appellants were crewmembers on a thirty-five foot, aqua blue, self-propelled, semi-submersible vessel (""SPSS"") that was apprehended by the U.S. Coast Guard on July 27, 2009, while operating in international waters near Malpelo Island, Colombia. No flag nor markings of registry were visible on the vessel. The vessel, which Valarezo admitted was semi-submerged in order to evade detection, was traveling from Colombia to Ecuador to pick up cargo for a transportation trip. The four-person crew had embarked from Colombia in a speed boat and boarded the SPSS three and a half hours from shore on or around July 25, 2009. Valarezo was paid in advance 3,000,000 Colombian pesos, or approximately 1,525 U.S. dollars, for his participation. Valarezo had been recruited by the SPSS's captain to join the crew. Valarezo said it was his first time participating in an SPSS transportation trip.While at sea on July 27, 2009, Valarezo spotted a maritime patrol helicopter and notified the SPSS's captain of its presence. The captain immediately ordered Valarezo to inflate a life raft and ordered Palomino to open four valves on the SPSS, causing the vessel to sink. By the time the Coast Guard reached the SPSS, the vessel had sunk completely and the entire crew had abandoned the vessel and boarded the life raft. All of the crewmembers claimed to be Colombian citizens. All crewmembers except the captain were transported to the United States for prosecution. Valarezo and Palomino were each charged in a two-count indictment for conspiracy and substantive violations of the Drug Trafficking Vessel Interdiction Act of 2008 (""DTVIA""), 18 U.S.C. § 2285, which proscribes operating or embarking in a semi-submersible vessel without nationality in international waters with the intent to evade detection. Palomino moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that 18 U.S.C. § 2285 is unconstitutional; Valarezo joined Palomino's motion. On November 2, 2009, the district court entered an order denying the motion in its entirety. Both Valarezo and Palomino then pleaded guilty to the charges without any plea agreement, preserving the right to appeal the district court's ruling about the statute's constitutionality. The court sentenced Valarezo to 108 months of imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently, followed by 36 months of supervised release. Palomino was sentenced to the same. Both Valarezo and Palomino timely appealed from the district court's order denying their motion to dismiss the indictment. Valarezo also appealed his sentence, challenging the eight-level enhancement to his offense level assessed under U.S.S.G. § 2X7.2(b)(1)(C) for the sinking of the vessel.",drug offences,0
"On the morning of January 8, 2009, the United States Coast Guard Ship ALERT (the ""ALERT"") received a report from a Maritime Patrol Aircraft (""MPA"") that an unmarked semi-submersible vessel (the ""Vessel"") was spotted in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, approximately 163 nautical-miles off the coast of Colombia. The Vessel was ocean-blue, 50 to 60 feet in length, and sat very low in the water. The ALERT immediately dispatched to the location where the Vessel was originally spotted and arrived around 12 hours later.Before the ALERT arrived, the MPA observed four men exit the cabin, don lifevests, inflate life-rafts, and jump into the water. The Defendants then waited near the Vessel, which sat dead in the water. Eventually they deflated the rafts and resumed travel.The ALERT dispatched a helicopter to obtain infrared imagery of the Vessel when it neared the Vessel's location. For an hour the helicopter covertly observed the Vessel and noted that, on two occasions, the Vessel stopped and a Defendant exited the forward hatch and scanned the area before returning below deck. After observation, the Helicopter illuminated the Vessel and announced its presence; at around this time the ALERT dispatched a rescue team on a rigid-hull inflatable boat (the ""Rescue"") to execute an interdiction.Once the helicopter illuminated the Vessel, the Defendants calmly exited the hatch, donned life-jackets, and inflated the life-rafts for a second time. One Defendant returned below deck, at which time helicopter personnel observed a ""flash of light"" and ""smoke or steam"" emit from the Vessel. After the Defendants jumped into the water, the Vessel sank.The Rescue arrived just as the boat was completely immersed. The Rescue crew escorted the Defendants back to the ALERT, where they were transferred to another U.S. Coast Guard ship, and eventually flown to Tampa, Florida. They arrived in Tampa on January 14, and were promptly arrested. Authorities interviewed each Defendant separately.On January 13, 2009, a federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging Defendants with conspiring to operate or embark in a semi-submersible vessel in international waters, without nationality and with the intent to evade detection, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2285, and operating, while aiding and abetting in the operation of, a semi-submersible vessel in international waters, without nationality and with the intent to evade detection, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2285 and 18 U.S.C. § 2. Defendants entered a plea of not guilty and requested a bench trial.

"On 13 December 2001, a grand jury in the Northern District of Illinois (USA) charged C.W.H. as the lead defendant in a 44-count indictment alleging a three-year international drug trafficking conspiracy involving 25 other co-defendants in what became known as the ""Baby Formula"" case.C.W.H., a Colombian national and a resident of Panama, was alleged to have been the conspiracy's primary supplier of heroin and cocaine. The operation involved conspirators recruiting female couriers in the United States, primarily in Chicago, to travel to Panama to receive the drugs from C.W.H.. The drugs were then smuggled into the United States using several methods, such as the couriers swallowing plastic wrapped packages of drugs or inserting them into their body cavities. However, the most popular method involved concealing the drugs inside baby formula cans. The conspirators paid parents in the United States to “rent” their infants to the smugglers. The couriers then traveled to Panama with these rented infants and baby formula cans. In Panama, the baby formula cans were filled with liquid cocaine and taken back to the United States.Following the 2001 grand jury indictment, C.W.H. became a fugitive until his capture in 2009. During this period, 23 of his co-defendants were convicted. In June 2009, C.W.H. was extradited from Panama to the United States, where he was arraigned in federal court in Chicago on 25 June 2009. In July 2009 a status hearing was held and a trial date was set for 9 November 2009; however, the trial began on 6 July 2010 after the government took an interlocutory appeal concerning the district court's decision to exclude certain evidence.After the trial began, the district court judge again excluded an exhibit of evidence and related testimony because he suspected that the evidence had been tampered with by the government. Specifically, the judge was concerned with the fact that, according to an evidence log sheet, the exhibit of heroin with the defendant's fingerprints on it had increased in weight by 20 grams between May and September 2001. The judge became convinced that the increase in weight may have been due to officers pressing a piece of tape with C.W.H.’s fingerprints onto the package. The government explained that “the reason for the increase in weight was that bag with the fingerprints, after being opened so that the presence and amount of the illegal drug contained in it could be verified, and later closed up again, [had] been weighed together with other bags”.The government filed a writ of mandamus to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals ordered that the exhibit be admitted into evidence and reassigned the case to another judge. Upon reassignment, the trial resumed and on 4 August 2010 C.W.H. was convicted on eight out of 14 counts against him: one count of conspiracy and seven counts of importing or attempting to import cocaine and heroin. C.W.H. was sentenced to 340 months' imprisonment.Several unsuccessful appeals were made by C.W.H.. However, in 2016 he sought relief from his sentence on the grounds that he was ""deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal"". The district court judge ordered a hearing on C.W.H.'s argument that he should have been advised by his counsel to plead guilty.",drug offences,0
"From January to April in 2009, co-defendants, Richard Johnson (“Johnson”), Jacob Tyler (“Tyler”), Craig Allen Corey II (“Corey”) and Robert Harris (“Harris”), conspired to and actually conducted a prostitution business from Corey’s apartment in Millersville, Maryland.       As a United States Army Officer, co-defendant, Corey, travelled from his Army assignment at Fort Meade, Maryland, to his hometown of Chillicothe, Ohio.  From Chillicothe and the surrounding areas, Corey recruited co-conspirators to assist with his Maryland prostitution operation.  Co-defendants, Corey, Harris, Johnson, Tyler, along with others, transported and enticed at least 12 female victims, both adult and minor, to travel to Maryland.  Corey particularly recruited victims from Watertown, New York and, via internet, from the State of Virginia.  The co-defendants photographed the female victims both clothed and unclothed, and gave them aliases.  The photos and aliases were used to advertise the women on Craigslist.org.  Corey’s laptop was used for advertising purposes.  The co-defendants also used MySpace.com, YouTube.com and other web-based social networking services, to recruit female victims to serve as prostitutes and to promote their prostitution business.Co-defendant, Corey, received a percentage of all earnings from the prostitution business.  These earnings could range in the thousands of dollars per week.  He used some of these earnings to buy, among other things, MDMA (Ecstasy or Molly) and Benzylpiperazine (BZP - a drug which has a stimulant effect on the central nervous system similar to that of ecstasy) from a drug dealer in Detroit, Michigan.  From January 2009 to September 2009, all of the co-defendants distributed these drugs, along with marijuana, Xanax and Percoset, to the female victims in order to motivate them to prostitute, to sex and drug customers, and to associates in both the States of Ohio and Maryland.Co-defendants, Tyler and Harri, brought illegal firearms into the apartment where the victim’s were held, to further their sex and drug trafficking operations.  In addition, all of the co-defendants beat the victims to force them into prostitution.  Co-defendants, Tyler and Harris, would beat the victims if they refused to provide their earnings to them.After the co-defendants were incarcerated, most of them attempted to contact potential witnesses and a victim to get them to change their statements.",drug offences,1

"In mid-2000, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Immigration and Naturalization Services, Indianapolis Police Department, and Metropolitan Drug Task Force began investigating the drug trafficking activities of a Mexican drug organization. Law enforcement determined that members of this organization were obtaining large amounts of controlled substances, including methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, and amphetamine, from individuals in Mexico, Texas, and Illinois. They were then distributing the drugs throughout areas in Indiana surrounding Indianapolis. Martin Avila, Fidelmar Soto-Nava, Wilbert Avant, Rene Nava-Rubio, and Hilario Espinoza-Sarco were all identified as potential members of the organization.From March through August of 2001, officers utilized court-authorized wiretaps to monitor cellular telephones linked to Soto-Nava and Nava-Rubio. In several of the intercepted conversations, Avila discussed the sale of drugs with Nava-Rubio using code language. At times, Avila also spoke briefly with Soto-Nava, although it does not appear from the record that they discussed drug distribution. Seventeen of these recordings would later be admitted into evidence at Avila's trial.On October 17, 2002, Avila and eight other members of the organization were indicted for conspiracy to distribute and/or possess with the intent to distribute numerous controlled substances. Specifically, the grand jury charged that Avila and his co-conspirators distributed 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing methamphetamine, 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, and 100 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana.",drug offences,0
"On April 18, 2004, at approximately 4:45 A.M., the United States Coast Guard (""USCG"") cutter DEPENDABLE found the M/V EL CONQUISTADOR (the ""vessel"") riding low and ""dead in the water"" in international waters 180 nautical miles south of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. A Rigid Hulled Inflatable Boat, the ABLE 2, was launched from the DEPENDABLE to approach the vessel.The ABLE 2 observed that the vessel's name was written on its stern, but the vessel did not have a visible registration number, port identification, or country flag. On board the ABLE 2, Officer Brian Hennessey (""Hennessey""), a technician and federal law enforcement officer with the USCG, requested that the vessel indicate its nationality. The vessel master answered that the vessel was registered in Colombia. He further claimed that the vessel had been fishing for approximately seven to eight days, but that the vessel's engines were broken, and that they had no fish on board and were en route to Haiti. Hennessey testified that he perceived a strong smell of marijuana coming from the vessel. Hennessey relayed via radio the information from the vessel master to the DEPENDABLE and waited for permission to board the vessel.At 7:39 A.M., Sean Connett (""Connett""), an employee with the USCG at the District Command Center in Miami, contacted the Colombian authorities to confirm the registry of the vessel via a written form entitled ""Action Request."" The Colombian authorities shortly responded with a ""Response to the Action"" form, indicating that they could neither confirm nor refute that the EL CONQUISTADOR was a Colombian vessel. The Colombian authorities also suggested that the USCG proceed under ""international law"" and requested that the USCG inform them of the results of the inspection.Acting on the premise that the vessel was ""stateless"" or ""without nationality,"" the USCG sought to place the vessel within U.S. jurisdiction. The Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (""MDLEA"") allows the United States to conduct drug law enforcement outside of the United States, and more specifically, exercise jurisdiction over stateless vessels. 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(c). In accordance with the MDLEA, Connett requested and received a ""Statement of No Objection"" from the USCG headquarters in Washington, D.C., granting permission to board EL CONQUISTADOR. Connett forwarded the Statement to the USCG office in San Juan, which then forwarded it to the DEPENDABLE.Upon boarding the vessel, Hennessey observed what appeared to be bales of marijuana, two of which were outside the fish hold, forty-six of which were inside the fish hold. He then conducted a field test confirming that the bales were, in fact, marijuana. In order to access the bales, USCG officers broke the fish hold, and transferred the bales onto the DEPENDABLE. The vessel's five crew members — the four Appellants and the captain, Joaquín Emilio Cardona-Sandoval (""Cardona-Sandoval"") — were also brought on board the DEPENDABLE. The Colombian authorities were notified of the USCG's findings, and upon arrival in San Juan, the Appellants were transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (""ICE"") and detained.At their joint trial, Appellants testified that they were fisherman in their home country of Colombia and that in 2004 they were recruited in Colombia to participate in a fishing expedition by two individuals known to them as ""Paco"" and ""Roberto."" Appellants testified that they were unacquainted with each other when they arrived at the vessel. They further testified that when they arrived, Paco and Roberto, along with others, were armed with weapons, and marijuana was on the vessel. According to Appellants, Paco threatened that Appellants' families would be killed if they did not take the marijuana to Haiti. Appellants testified that they feared for their families. After a few days at sea, the vessel broke down.On September 7, 2004, a jury found all four Appellants guilty of both counts of the indictment. A pre-sentencing report (""PSR"") was then filed on November 18, 2004, recommending that Appellants be granted a two-point reduction in their base offense level of 32 due to their minor roles in the offense. Martínez and Bravo were sentenced individually, and Isaa and Mancilla were sentenced jointly. At Appellants' various sentencing hearings, the government opposed the minor role reduction. The court denied the minor role adjustments, indicating that the evidence was such that it could not state who was a major and who was a minor participant in the case.At his sentencing hearing, Appellant Martínez raised no objections to the PSR, and accordingly, was not granted any adjustments, and was sentenced to 120 months imprisonment. In the other sentencing hearings, Appellants Bravo, Isaa and Mancilla objected to the PSR and requested a safety-valve benefit, as well as a downward departure for duress. Appellants participated in a government debriefing in order to qualify for the safety-valve benefit, but they each received a sealed motion from the government stating that the safety-valve would not be recommended because the government did not believe that Appellants had provided all available information in a truthful manner.Isaa's and Mancilla's joint hearing was held on December 8, 2004. The court granted them an immediate hearing to determine their entitlement to the safety-valve benefit. A DEA special agent testified that, although Appellants' stories coincided in certain aspects, it was abnormal that Appellants did not know the details of how the drug transfer was going to take place. He explained that the scenario was ""too risky"" to be believable; he had never investigated a case in which a drug trafficker had placed unknown individuals against their wills on a vessel loaded with contraband of such value without providing information about the transfer, or without agreeing to any payment. The agent also noticed that, based on his experience and training, Appellants appeared to easily answer ""non-stressful"" questions about their families and Colombia, but that a level of stress or deception was perceptible in Appellants' answers to questions regarding the smuggling venture, the drugs, and payments.The court denied Isaa and Mancilla the safety-valve benefit, indicating that the consistency of Appellants' statements did not overcome the gaps in the logic of their story. The court also denied their requests for a downward departure for duress. Again, the court indicated that it did not find Appellants' stories to be totally truthful. Both Appellants were then sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum term of 120 months of imprisonment.Bravo was sentenced a week later, on December 15, 2004. The district court denied Bravo's request for a safety-valve hearing, and subsequently denied him the safety-valve benefit. Neither denial was explained by the court. The court also denied Bravo's request for a downward departure for duress, and sentenced him to the statutory mandatory minimum term of 120 months of imprisonment.",drug offences,1
"On May 30, 2005, the United States Coast Guard (""USCG"") spotted a ""go-fast"" boat alongside a fishing vessel in international waters off the coast of Ecuador. After the two vessels separated, the go-fast boat appeared dead in the water. When the USCG launched an inflatable boat to conduct a boarding, the go-fast boat attempted to escape. A USCG helicopter fired warning shots, which caused the go-fast boat to stop. Before jumping overboard, the four crew members of the go-fast boat were observed removing their clothing, throwing cargo overboard and attempting to set the boat on fire.The crew was apprehended, including Defendant Estupinan. A total of approximately 118 bales of cocaine, weighing approximately 2,676 kilograms, were recovered from the go-fast boat and the surrounding waters. Estupinan and his co-defendants were taken into custody by the USCG.On June 7, 2005, Estupinan and his co-defendants were charged in a two-count indictment with: (1) possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(a) and (g), and 21 U.S.C. § 960(b)(1)(B)(ii); and (2) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(a), (g), and (j), and 21 U.S.C. § 960(b)(1)(B). On July 18, 2005, Estupinan pled guilty to count two of the indictment (the conspiracy count) pursuant to a written plea agreement, and on July 25, 2005, the district court accepted Estupinan's guilty plea. On October 28, 2005, based on an adjusted offense level of 33, a criminal history category of I, and an advisory Guidelines range of 135-168 months' imprisonment, the district court sentenced Estupinan to 135 months' imprisonment.",drug offences,1
"On 9 October 2004, Massey and two other defendants arrived at Miami International Airport from Ecuador. United States Customs and Border Protection (""CBP"") suspected that they were internal carriers of drugs. At the secondary inspection at the airport, the defendants consented to x-rays, which showed that all three had two to three foreign objects in their pelvic regions.The defendants were sent to Jackson Memorial Hospital, Ward D. While there, the defendants refused treatment and were verbally abusive with CBP and medical staff. Massey, in particular, screamed threats and profanities at anyone nearby. During this time, she had one leg and hand handcuffed to the side of her bed. Due to her increasingly belligerent behavior, CBP officers decided to handcuff her other hand to the bed. Unbeknownst to CBP, Massey had already taken two of the three foreign objects from her body and hidden them inside her pillow. She resisted being handcuffed and repeatedly hit an officer, until she was eventually restrained by several more CBP officers. On route to radiology later that day, Massey spit in the face of the same officer she had hit before and threatened further violence.The next day, Massey, still in Ward D, admitted to an officer that she had something inside her and was trying to pull it out. Medical staff were unable to remove the object. During this time, Massey became angry, got off the examining table, and went back to her room. Her arms and legs were no longer handcuffed as she had been complying. Later that night, she pulled the covering off the object still inside her and went into medical distress. She was then taken to Obstetrics and Gynecology, where doctors removed the object and some brown powder, which later tested positive for heroin. While there, Massey went into respiratory arrest. She recovered, and the following day she was taken off the respirator.On 11 October 2004, after Massey was taken to Obstetrics and Gynecology, CBP officers conducted a search of her room in Ward D. They discovered the two objects that she had hidden in her pillow. They also found that she had unsuccessfully attempted to make a hole in her mattress. The other two defendants eventually admitted to CBP officers that they had foreign objects and consented to having them removed. All of the objects found in the vaginal canal of each defendant tested positive for heroin. Massey was released from Jackson Memorial Hospital on 13 October 2004.The Drug Enforcement Administration laboratory determined that the heroin seized from Massey had a net weight of 147.3 grams. The total weight of heroin seized from all three defendants was 549.1 grams. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Massey pled guilty to Count One and Count Nine in the indictment, respectively, conspiracy to import 100 grams or more of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 960(a), (b)(2)(A) and 21 U.S.C. § 963, and assaulting a federal officer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 111(a)(1).At her plea hearing, Massey stated that she took Zoloft to treat her bipolar disorder. She claimed that she did not remember everything that happened at the hospital because she did not receive Zoloft during her stay there and was under the influence of the heroin that had burst inside her. Her defense attorney argued, and the government conceded, that this might be a mitigating factor with regard to Massey's ultimate sentence.",drug offences,0
"While patrolling international waters in the Eastern Pacific Ocean on May 11, 2001, the crew of a United States Navy P3 surveillance airplane spotted a ""go-fast"" vessel traveling at high speed and followed it. Shortly thereafter, the crew observed the occupants of the boat throwing bales overboard. The Navy P3 crew informed the United States Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment aboard the USS HALYBURTON of the position of the go-fast boat and also dropped a sonar buoy into the water to mark the location of the discarded bales.A helicopter was launched from the USS HALYBURTON to investigate the go-fast boat. The helicopter videotaped the floating bales and followed the go-fast boat with a crew of four for several hours as it increased its speed and changed course. After failed attempts to contact the go-fast crew by both the USS HALYBURTON and the helicopter with communications equipment, the USS HALYBURTON launched a rigged hull inflatable boat to intercept the go-fast boat. When Coast Guard personnel boarded the go-fast boat, the four-man crew had their hands raised. Defendant-Appellant, Geovanni Quintero Rendon, identified himself as the captain and advised that they had departed from Caballo Beach, Colombia, the previous day to assist some lost fishermen. The other crew members were Julian Pineda Torres, John Caisedo Castro, and Carlos Estupinan Valencia.Although the vessel flew no flag and contained no identifying markings or registration documents, Rendon stated that the boat was registered in Colombia. Colombian officials, however, were unable to confirm Rendon's claim of registry. Inspection of the boat revealed twenty-three barrels of fuel, fuel filters, containers of oil, a spare engine, and two high frequency radios. Coast Guard personnel found traces of cocaine in the forward compartment of the boat as well as on the port and starboard rails.Rendon and the other crew members were moved to the USS HALYBURTON and detained. The go-fast boat was destroyed as a navigation hazard. The next morning, the USS HALYBURTON proceeded to the area where the cargo had been jettisoned and recovered forty-eight bales of cocaine. Subsequent analysis revealed a net weight of 1,171 kilograms of cocaine with a seventy-percent purity level. Rendon and the other crew members were taken to Jacksonville, Florida.A federal grand jury in the Middle District of Florida returned a two-count superseding indictment charging the four-man crew of the go-fast boat with conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of §§ 1903(a), (g) and (j) of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (""MDLEA""), 46 U.S.C. app. §§ 1901-1904; 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(ii); and 18 U.S.C. § 2. Thereafter, Torres filed two motions to dismiss the indictment that challenged the constitutionality of the MDLEA. The first asserted that, under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), both the MDLEA and 21 U.S.C. § 960 are unconstitutional. The second motion challenged the jurisdictional provisions of the MDLEA that provide that subject matter jurisdiction is a preliminary question of law to be determined by the trial judge.Rendon adopted Torres's motions, and filed his own Apprendi-based motion to dismiss the indictment. The district judge denied all these motions to dismiss. At trial, Rendon informed the district judge that he wanted to plead guilty. He pled guilty to both counts of the superseding indictment without a plea agreement.At the sentencing hearing, Rendon did not object to the facts in the Presentence Investigation Report. Rather, Rendon reiterated his jurisdictional objections, which the district judge overruled, and his objection to enhancements for both being a captain and organizer/leader.During Rendon's sentencing, two of his codefendants, Castro and Torres, testified that Rendon had recruited them to participate in the conspiracy and paid them each 10,000,000 pesos. Both further testified that Rendon had been the captain of their vessel and had directed their efforts throughout the duration of the voyage. Castro testified that they met two boats with two people on each boat who placed the cocaine in Rendon's boat. Even when Torres was operating the boat, it was under Rendon's direction because Torres did not know where the cocaine was to be delivered. Torres also testified that Rendon ordered the codefendants to throw the cocaine overboard when he saw the Navy plane flying overhead.Rendon was subject to a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of ten years and a maximum term of life as to each indictment count. 21 U.S.C. § 960(b)(1)(B). He was given upward adjustments for being both the captain of the go-fast boat and being an organizer or leader of the conspiracy. Rendon was sentenced to concurrent terms of 360 months of imprisonment, sixty months of supervised release, and a $200 fine.",drug offences,0
"On March 10, 1998, a thirty count indictment was issued alleging that Juan Almeida committed several crimes when he made arrangements to distribute large quantities of cocaine to New York and Russia. Almeida was charged in nine of the 30 counts and ultimately convicted on 'cocaine conspiracy'. The conspiracy to distribute cocaine was stated to encompasse three ventures that were undertaken between 1986 and 1995. The first venture took place in the late 1980's when Almeida with fugitive co-conspirator Nelson ""Tony"" Yester (who was still at large at the time of the case), coordinated the transportation of several shipments of cocaine from Miami to New York.  The second venture entailed a scheme to acquire a World War II-era Russian submarine for a Colombian drug cartel. The third venture involved a plan to conceal cocaine inside Russia-bound shipments of shrimp. The Government's ""star"" witness with respect to the submarine and shrimp ventures was Ludwig ""Tarzan"" Fainberg, a Russian-speaking immigrant who was charged in the conspiracy (and who ultimately pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement.) Almeida and Fainberg each hired their own defense attorneys. They believed, however, that some coordination might be useful in defeating the Government's case.  The co-defendants therefore entered into an oral joint defense agreement. According to Almeida's counsel, ""countless volumes of attorney-client and work product information [were] ... shared between the parties"" and ""dozens of meetings (totaling well over 100 hours) were held."" On February 19, 1999, approximately one month before trial, Fainberg decided to defect from the united front. In return for his testimony against Almeida, the Government allowed Fainberg to plead to a single count of racketeering (attracting 37 months imprisonment). In the Government's view, this meant the district court in the case of Almedia had to address the alleged existence of an attorney-client privilege and a possible conflict of interest. The judgment of the court on appeal did not discuss the convictions for ''cocaine conspiracy'', rather it limited itself to these discreet questions essentially around the ability of co-defendants’ counsel to share confidential information for the purpose of pursuing a common interest. At trial, the district court had precluded Almeida’s counsel from utilizing privileged communications in cross-examining Fainberg that Fainberg made to Almeida’s attorneys during the existence of the joint defense agreement Fainberg entered into an agreement with the Government to plead guilty and testify against Almeida.The court of appeal examined the correctness of the district court in denying the jury any benefit of those communications and information.",drug offences,1
"On May 1, 2001, the United States Coast Guard Cutters Bear and Tampa, which had been conducting law enforcement surveillance in an area of the Caribbean Sea between eastern Cuba and the Bahamas, maneuvered into position to intercept a go-fast vessel named the Notty. When the Bear directed the Notty to heave to, the Notty increased speed and attempted to evade the Coast Guard Cutters and air surveillance. During the high-speed chase that followed, Coast Guard personnel observed the crew of the Notty throwing packages overboard as the Notty maneuvered in a zig-zag pattern. The Tampa moved into position and fired warning shots in front of the Notty, but the Notty proceeded to use evasive maneuvers for approximately twenty more minutes. Eventually, the Notty stopped and a Coast Guard party from the Bear boarded the vessel.McPhee and two other co-defendants, Darron Lloyd Rolle and Dave Mario Williams, were found aboard the Notty. Although all three claimed Bahamian nationality and the master of the Notty claimed that the vessel was registered in the Bahamas, no registration was found on board the vessel. When inquiry directed at Bahamian authorities did not result in an affirmative and unequivocal assertion that the vessel was registered in the Bahamas, the Coast Guard deemed the vessel stateless, arrested the defendants, and brought them to Key West, Florida. The Coast Guard recovered a total of ninety-four bales of marijuana (weighing 2,092 pounds) which had been thrown overboard during the hot pursuit.McPhee was indicted, along with the other two crew members, for conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute (Count One) and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute (Count Two) while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. §§ 1903(j) and 1903(a). On October 30, 2001, McPhee and the co-defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the indictment, challenging the government's assertion that the vessel upon which they had been apprehended was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. They claimed, in essence, that the Notty had never left the territorial waters of the Bahamas and, therefore, that the United States did not have authority to arrest them. (McPhee and his co-defendants did not dispute that the Bahamian government could not verify that their vessel was registered in the Bahamas.) The government responded, however, that the Notty was subject to American jurisdiction because it was ""without nationality,"" that is, it was a ""stateless vessel"" that had been intercepted in international waters, and, that even if the vessel had been intercepted in Bahamian waters, the Bahamas and the United States had entered into an agreement that allowed the United States to exercise jurisdiction over stateless vessels located more than three miles from Bahamian land.Soon thereafter, on November 30, 2001, the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss and, at the conclusion of the hearing, invited the parties to supplement their pleadings in support of their positions. On December 26, 2001, the district court denied the defendants' motion, finding that the Notty was indeed subject to the jurisdiction of the United States because it was a vessel without nationality seized in international waters, and that, in any event, the Bahamian Government consented to enforcement of American law by the United States in Bahamian territorial waters. After the denial of this motion, as noted, McPhee entered a conditional plea of guilty to Count One.",drug offences,0
"On 18 June 2000, the United States Coast Guard cutter Thetis was on a counter-narcotics patrol in the eastern Pacific Ocean. During the patrol, the Thetis encountered a fiberglass vessel approximately 475 nautical miles west of the Columbian/Ecuadorian border in international waters. The vessel was approximately 40 feet in length, equipped with three outboard motors, and low in profile to the water. When the crew first observed the vessel, it was approximately 300 miles from the nearest point of land. Randy Bradley, a law enforcement officer aboard the Thetis, later testified that this type of vessel, when used for recreational purposes, usually would stay within 20 nautical miles of the shore due to its limited fuel capacity. Thetis crew members did not see any markings of identification or a flag on the vessel. The crew attempted to hail the vessel by way of radio communications in English and Spanish but received no response.As the Thetis proceeded towards the vessel, the Thetis crew launched a rigid-hull inflatable boat (""RHI"") that contained a four-person boarding team that was ordered to intercept and board the vessel. Once the RHI was in the water, the unresponsive vessel changed its previous course and began zigzagging to the left and to the right. While the RHI boarding team was attempting the interception, lookout officers aboard the Thetis observed four individuals on the zigzagging vessel. The individuals later were identified as Pedro Luis Christopher Tinoco, Neil Pomare Hoard, Manuel Hernandez, and Tito Daniel Estupinan, the four criminal defendants in this case. The Thetis lookout officers saw one defendant driving the vessel, one defendant walking back and forth on the vessel, and two defendants throwing overboard what were later identified as bales of cocaine and 55-gallon fuel drums. To locate the items thrown overboard by two of the defendants, the Thetis crew threw into the ocean two smoke floats.As they pursued the zigzagging vessel, the RHI boarding team, observed the defendants aboard the vessel dumping items into the ocean. They saw bales, fuel drums, wooden objects, and the vessel's hatch being thrown overboard. After a 20 to 30 minute chase, the RHI was able to intercept the vessel. RHI Boarding Officers Tim Burke and Shelby Harrington then boarded the vessel and handcuffed the defendants.Officer Burke testified at trial that, once on board, he asked the vessel's driver, later identified as Defendant Tinoco, about the vessel's country of origin. Tinoco answered that the vessel was from Colombia.  In a statement introduced by the defendants at trial, Officer Harrington stated that she spoke with the defendant later identified as Hoard, who told her that the vessel's crew was from San Andreas, Colombia, and that the vessel was from Buena Venture, Colombia. Hoard also told her that the vessel was en route to the Galapagos Islands. When asked which of the four defendants was the vessel's master, Hoard pointed to Tinoco. After Officers Burke and Harrington spoke with Tinoco and Hoard, the RHI boarding team conducted a search of the vessel. The passports of the four defendants were obtained. Despite a thorough search, however, the RHI boarding team was unable to find any identifying marks or registration documents that would confirm the claims made by Tinoco and Hoard that the vessel was Colombian in origin. The only other items found on board were spare engine parts, navigational and communication equipment, approximately 30 fuel drums, food and beverages, and clothing.Following the search of the vessel, the defendants were transferred to the Thetis cutter. Several members of the Thetis crew then proceeded to search the waters where the smoke floats had been thrown, using the vessel that had been seized to conduct the recovery operation. Approximately 97.5 wrapped bales were retrieved from the water. The bales subsequently were transferred to a Drug Enforcement Administration (""DEA"") warehouse in Miami, Florida. Scott Goodlin, a DEA forensic chemist, then sampled the bales and tested them for the presence of a controlled substance, finding that they contained cocaine. At trial, Goodlin estimated that, based on his sampling technique, the net weight of cocaine contained in the seized bales was 1,807 kilograms. The market value in the United States of this amount of cocaine, at the time the trial occurred, would have ranged from $12,000 to $29,000 per kilogram, according to the trial testimony of Adalberto Rivera, a drug agent at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (""FBI"").At the time the aforementioned events were occurring in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, a series of diplomatic communications took place between the Coast Guard and the Colombian Navy. After RHI Boarding Officers Burke and Harrington spoke with Tinoco and Hoard about the nationality of the vessel and its crew, Officer Harrington relayed a radio communication to Christopher Barrows, an operations officer onboard the Thetis. She informed him about the verbal claims made by the defendants that the vessel was from Colombia and that the crew was of Colombian nationality. The Coast Guard was to use this information to brief the Colombian Navy about the interception.After receiving the information from Officer Harrington, Officer Barrows communicated with, and sent a series of situation reports to, a Lieutenant Jelin from the Coast Guard District 11, who subsequently provided the information to the Coast Guard headquarters and the United States Department of State in Washington, D.C. Pursuant to the terms of the ""Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Colombia to Suppress Illicit Traffic by Sea,"" the Coast Guard then contacted the Colombian Navy, briefed it about the situation, and requested that the Colombian Navy attempt to verify the verbal claims by the defendants that their vessel was registered in Colombia. The purpose of these communications was to determine whether the vessel was a ""vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States"" as defined in the MDLEA, 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(c), which would permit the United States to exercise jurisdiction over the case.Shortly thereafter, the Colombian Navy responded that it needed the name and registration number of the vessel before it could confirm or refute the verbal claims that the vessel was of Colombian origin. The Coast Guard then informed the Colombian Navy that it was unable to provide any additional information, given the absence of any identifying marks on the vessel and of any registration documents found on board. The Coast Guard also told the Colombian Navy that ""the four crewman aboard the vessel refused to provide any information pertaining to their personal identification or that of the vessel."" Based on the information provided by the Coast Guard, the Colombian Navy stated that it was unable to confirm or refute the verbal claims made by the defendants that their vessel was of Colombian registry. As a result, the Coast Guard ""assimilated the vessel to stateless status."" In terms of the MDLEA, the vessel was treated as a ""vessel without nationality,"" as defined in § 1903(c)(2)(C), and thus as a ""vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States"" under 46 U.S.C. app. 1903(c)(1)(A). Accordingly, the four defendants were transported to the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, to face federal prosecution for the alleged drug smuggling operation.On 19 July 2000, a federal grand jury returned a two-count superseding indictment against Tinoco, Hernandez, Estupinan, and Hoard, charging that they committed two offenses under the MDLEA, to wit: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(a), (g), and (j) (Count I), and possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(a), (g) and 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count II). The Defendants pled not guilty. In December of 2001, the four defendants were tried before a federal jury, and all four of them were convicted on both counts.Following the convictions, the district court meted out sentences for the drug trafficking operation. The district court sentenced Hernandez to a term of 200 months of imprisonment and to 5 years of supervised release on each count, to run concurrently, and he was charged a $200 special assessment. The court sentenced Estupinan to a term of 252 months of imprisonment and to 5 years of supervised released on each count, to run concurrently, and he was charged a $200 special assessment. After imposition of sentence, Hernandez and Estupinan commenced this appeal to challenge their convictions.",drug offences,1
"This case concerns an international marijuana and cocaine conspiracy spanning from 1976 to 1990, involving two major international drug organizations, the ""West End Gang"" headed by Appellant and a Colombian drug organization headed by Angel Sanchez. The West End Gang, headquartered in Montreal, Canada, was led by Dooney Ryan until his murder on November 14, 1984. Shortly after the murder, Appellant, having observed police at the motel where Ryan was staying and, being unaware of Ryan's demise, had his attorney, Sidney Leithman, call the Montreal Police Department to determine if Ryan and his companion that evening, Paul April, had been arrested. April became a suspect in Ryan's murder as Leithman's phone call alerted the police to April's presence with Ryan. On November 25, 1984, April was killed by a bomb in Montreal. Appellant thereafter indicated to two associates, Gaeton Lafond, Jr., and John Quitoni, that he had ordered April's murder in retaliation for the murder of Ryan. Appellant succeeded Ryan as the leader of the West End Gang.At the time of Ryan's murder, he and Quitoni had been negotiating a cocaine deal, which Appellant subsequently consummated. Through Quitoni and James Allardyce, the West End Gang completed several deliveries of cocaine from South Florida to Canada. In May 1985, at the Marriott Harbor Beach Hotel in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, Allardyce met with Appellant, Elaine Cohen (Appellant's wife), David Singer, and Jean Guy Trepanier.[1]Quitoni testified that within a week after this meeting, Trepanier asked him to come to the Windjammer Resort in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea to supply him a pistol. Quitoni gave the pistol to Trepanier and Raymond DesFosse, who was also present. Early the next morning, in an agitated state, Trepanier called Quitoni and asked him to come to the Windjammer to assist him. There, Trepanier and DesFosse told Quitoni that they had killed ""the rat,"" David Singer, on behalf of Appellant because Singer was a potential witness against Appellant on drug and murder charges. They further admitted shooting a police officer the previous night, whereupon Quitoni drove Trepanier and DesFosse to an airport. Appellant later thanked Quitoni for aiding the escape of Trepanier and DesFosse.Shortly after midnight on May 10, 1985, Trooper Michael Foti of the Florida Highway Patrol stopped a maroon Toyota. As Foti approached the driver's side door, the driver fired a shot, wounding Foti in his right leg. Later that morning, a K-9 officer with the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department tracked two individuals who had fled from a maroon Toyota to the area where a witness had been assaulted shortly after the shooting of Foti. That witness identified Trepanier as the man who aimed a pistol at him while running down the street with another man; the police found the revolver used to kill Singer in the maroon Toyota. Singer's body was found the next day, and the medical examiner determined that Singer's death had occurred on May 10. An associate of Singer testified that shortly before Singer's death, he overheard Singer's side of a telephone conversation in which Singer was upset because Leithman was claiming that Singer was a police informant.Meanwhile, Angel Sanchez ran a large drug operation in Colombia. Although initially the organization only smuggled marijuana into the United States, in late 1981, Angel Sanchez, Pompo Sanchez, William Blackledge, Mark Klein, Robert Lazara, and Robert Moore met to discuss Sanchez's first load of cocaine. Sanchez's organization flew in its first cocaine load in February 1982. Roberto and Raul Aspuru stored the imported cocaine in Florida prior to its distribution.David Sabio, who was highly involved in the importations, testified that he arranged a 1986 meeting between Blackledge and Appellant to enable Sanchez to supply cocaine to Appellant. Blackledge thereafter introduced Moore to Appellant. According to Moore, Appellant agreed to make huge, biweekly purchases of cocaine. Roberto Aspuru testified that the Sanchez organization supplied Appellant approximately 300-400 kilograms of cocaine during this time. In 1987, Appellant met with Sanchez to discuss the delivery of a large cocaine shipment to Canada.In the Spring of 1987, the Sanchez organization recruited Bertram Gordon to arrange a deal with Appellant. Gordon met with Appellant at Blackledge's home several times in 1987, and eventually they agreed that Appellant would import three loads of cocaine from Colombia to Canada, through the United States. The loads, each consisting of approximately 600 kilograms of cocaine, were flown from Colombia to Appellant's employees in Nashville, Tennessee. In July 1987, Gordon left the United States for Canada, where he served as a middleman in certain of Appellant's drug transactions.That summer, Angel Sanchez sent two boats to Europe, the ""Finesse"" containing 146 kilograms of cocaine and the ""Big John"" containing 600 kilograms of cocaine. Working for Appellant, Trepanier was to off-load the ""Finesse"" cocaine and distribute it in Europe. Of the ""Big John"" load, although some was targeted for the Sicilian Mafia, the majority was scheduled for distribution in Spain by Appellant. Appellant sent other employees to assist Trepanier; however, Portuguese and Spanish authorities made arrests and seized the ""Finesse"" cocaine.Contemporaneous with the ships' sailing, the Spanish National Police were observing Appellant's agents, Sabio and Francois LeBoeuf. The Spanish National Police wiretapped various telephones in accordance with Spanish law and observed Trepanier meeting with Appellant at the Malaga, Spain airport in late January 1988. The Spanish police then, again pursuant to Spanish law, wiretapped Appellant's hotel telephone. Transcripts of these various wiretaps were presented at trial, showing incriminating conversations between Sabio, LeBoeuf, Appellant, Blackledge, and Angel Sanchez and his associates. Simultaneously, the Spanish police in Madrid observed meetings between Angel Sanchez and members of Appellant's organization, including LeBoeuf and Sabio.At trial, the government presented evidence of Appellant's attempts to intervene in the police investigation of the drug conspiracy. Specifically, John Flanders, a law clerk to Ft. Lauderdale attorney Kenneth DeLegal, testified that he flew to Montreal in late 1990 to consult with Leithman about the possible representation of Gordon. Although Leithman never told Flanders who was paying for this assistance, Flanders did see Appellant in Leithman's office. At Leithman's request, Flanders flew to Holland in January 1991 to offer Gordon representation, although DeLegal had no prior contact with Gordon. Gordon testified that (1) Flanders claimed to be an attorney retained by ""his friends"" to represent him, (2) Flanders advised him not to talk to any law enforcement authorities, and (3) Flanders claimed Appellant would provide him money.Detective Chris Dale of the Broward County Sheriff's Department arrested Appellant on October 7, 1991 in Ft. Lauderdale. En route to jail, Appellant offered Dale a bribe, stating, as paraphrased by Dale: ""Not that I would, but it sure would be nice if I could give you $200,000 or so and you would let me go."" Dale ignored the comment.",drug offences,0
"In 1985 Special Agent Enrique Camarena-Salazar of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration was abducted, tortured and murdered by drug dealers in Mexico. OnApril 2, 1990, Humberto Alvarez-Machain was forcibly kidnapped from his medical office in Guadalajara, México, to be flown to El Paso, Texas, where he was arrested by Drug Enforcement Agency officials. Alvarez-Machain was a Mexican citizen. The Mexican government has officially protested the kidnappings. In Alvarez-Machain v. United States of America, 266 F.3d 1045 (2001), court records describe Alvarez-Machain present at the house where Camarena-Salazar was held.Alvarez-Machain was accused of having contributed in Special Agent Camarena’s murder in a predominantly gruesome manner: he allegedly used his medical skills to lengthen Camarena’s life under torture so that other members of the drug organization could interrogate him in an effort to learn what Camarena knew regarding their drug operation. Alvarez-Machain v. United States of America, 266 F.3d 1045 (2001), records show that the Drug Enforcement Administration hired Garate-Bustamante, an informant to the administration and a Mexican national who then contacted Ignacio Barragan (businessman) to assist with apprehending Alvarez-Machain in Mexico.n March of 1990, Barragan consulted with Sosa, a former Mexican policeman, to assist with the operation (Alvarez-Machain v. United States of America, 266 F.3d 1045 (2001). Court records in Alvarez-Machain v. United States of America, 266 F.3d 1045 (2001), show that Barragan told Sosa (former police officer) that the Drug Enforcement Administration had a warrant to arrest Alvarez-Machain, would pay for anything they required to successfully operate and promised Sosa a Mexican government position if he cooperated.",drug offences,1

"On April 30, 1975, an indictment charging appellant Griselda Blanco and 37 others was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and the case was assigned to Judge John Cannella. The indictment charged the defendants with conspiring to manufacture, import into the United States, and distribute cocaine. By January 1976, twelve of the conspirators had been prosecuted and convicted, and two others had pleaded guilty.When the indictment was returned in April, 1975, Blanco, a Colombian citizen, was living in Colombia. In May, 1975, the district court issued a warrant for her arrest.At trial, the prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of Carmen Caban, a former drug dealer turned government witness. Caban testified at length about the operations between 1972 and 1975 of the cocaine importing ring in which Blanco allegedly participated.To corroborate Caban's testimony about the existence of a drug importing conspiracy, the prosecution presented evidence of arrests of drug couriers, seizures of drugs, and conversations between suspected drug dealers which occurred between 1972 and 1975. For example, the prosecution introduced evidence of the 1972 arrest of one Antonio Romero, who was apprehended at Kennedy Airport trying to smuggle cocaine into the United States by concealing it in a dog cage.The jury returned a verdict of guilty on one count of conspiracy to manufacture, import into the United States, and distribute cocaine. Two days later, the court sentenced Blanco to fifteen years in prison and fined her $25,000.",drug offences,0
"The six defendants, all foreign nationals, were crew members aboard the ROSANGEL, a Honduran vessel. On May 24, 1984, the United States Coast Guard cutter V. LYPAN intercepted the ROSANGEL approximately 125 miles due east of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. A Coast Guard officer observed ""bale type objects"" on the main deck of the ROSANGEL. Coast Guard personnel boarded and searched the vessel, finding 114 bales of marijuana on the main deck and in the forward hold.After a documentation check revealed that the vessel was of Honduran registry, the Coast Guard contacted the Honduran government by telephone and, with Captain Barrios' permission, waited on board the ROSANGEL for a response. When the Honduran government subsequently issued a statement of ""no objection"" to the boarding, search, seizure, and prosecution of the crew members of the ROSANGEL under United States law, the six defendants were arrested and transported to Miami for indictment and prosecution.",drug offences,0
"On January 7, 1984, the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Escape, while patrolling an area in the Caribbean Sea known as the Mysteriosa Bank of the Yucatan Pass, a thoroughfare used to transport marijuana from Colombia, South America to the United States, sited a shrimp boat, the El Don, lying dead in the water, apparently having engine trouble. The Coast Guard suspected that the El Don was a smuggling vessel; she was not rigged for fishing, flew no flag, and bore no markings indicating her home port. Exercising the ""right of approach,"" the Escape pulled alongside the El Don, and several Coast Guardsmen boarded her to examine her registration papers and determine her identity. In the course of accomplishing this, the Coast Guardsmen discovered a cargo in excess of four and one-half tons of marijuana in the vessel's hold.The Coast Guardsmen determined that the El Don was of Panamanian registry. This information was relayed to the U.S. State Department which, in turn, communicated with the Panamanian government. Thereafter, the Coast Guard, presumably with Panama's approval, instructed the Escape to seize the El Don and its crew and to take them to Key West, Florida for prosecution. The Escape followed this instruction.On January 20, 1984, in the Southern District of Florida, the El Don's crew, the appellees here, were indicted under the Marijuana on the High Seas Act of 1980and the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 in five counts, as follows. Count I charged the defendants under 21 U.S.C. § 955c (1982) with conspiring to possess marijuana in United States customs waters in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 955a(c) (1982). Count II charged the defendants with the substantive offense, violating section 955a(c). Count III charged the defendants, again under 21 U.S.C. § 955c, with conspiring to possess marijuana with intent to import it, or knowing that it will be imported, into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 955a(d) (1982), and count IV charged the substantive section 955a(d) offense. Count V charged the defendants with conspiring, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 963 (1982), to import marijuana into the United States from a place outside thereof in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 952(a) and 960(a)(1) (1982). The defendants moved the district court to dismiss all five counts of the indictment on the ground that the sections of the Marijuana on the High Seas Act on which the counts were based were so vague and overbroad as to violate the due process clause of the fifth amendment. They attacked counts I and II on an additional ground; Congress did not intend to make it a crime for a person not a United States citizen to conspire to possess, or to possess, marijuana on a foreign vessel on the high seas. The defendants also moved the court to suppress the marijuana the Coast Guard had taken from the El Don, claiming that the seizure violated the fourth amendment.The district court, on March 30, 1984, convened a hearing on the defendants' motions. At that and subsequent hearings, the parties produced the facts we have recited, albeit in somewhat greater detail, on the issue of the validity of the Coast Guard's search and seizure of the El Don. Following the hearings, the court, in a memorandum order, dismissed the indictment. The court gave no reasons for its action, except as to count II. It concluded that count II failed to state an offense because the defendants' possession of marijuana had taken place on a foreign vessel located on the high seas, i.e., beyond the territorial waters of the United States, and section 955a(c) did not reach such conduct. The government now appeals.",drug offences,0
"Two cases have been consolidated for the purposes of this appeal; the facts in each are substantially identical. In United States v. Marino-Garcia, No. 81-5551, the Coast Guard cutter DEPENDABLE approached the vessel FOUR ROSES on the high seas 65 miles off the west coast of Cuba and 300 miles from Florida. Coast Guard officials boarded the vessel and discovered approximately 57,000 pounds of marijuana. No evidence reflected that the contraband was intended for the United States. Moreover, the FOUR ROSES was not an American ship but was instead a vessel without nationality. Finally, the nine crewmen were all foreign nationals.Coast Guard officials seized the vessel and arrested the crewmen. The crewmen were indicted for conspiracy to possess and possession of marijuana with an intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. § 955a. Defendants sought dismissal of the indictment. They argued that the court had no subject matter jurisdiction over stateless vessels absent proof of a nexus between the vessel and the United States. They further contended that the Government failed to allege sufficient facts necessary to establish the requisite nexus. The district court denied the motion. After a jury trial, defendants were convicted on both counts and sentenced to varying terms of incarceration. Defendants appeal.In the companion case, United States v. Cassalins-Guzman, No. 82-5284, the Coast Guard cutter LIPAN encountered the vessel LADY MARK on the high seas in the vicinity of Cuba. The LIPAN forced the vessel to heave to and attempted to ascertain the LADY MARK's nationality. Crewmen on board informed personnel on the LIPAN that the vessel was registered in Colombia and that the next port of call was El Salvador. Coast Guard officials nonetheless boarded the LADY MARK to verify the nationality. The boarding party discovered approximately 20,000 pounds of marijuana on the vessel. The party also located four different national flags and $1,000 in United States currency. The boarding party did not, however, discover any evidence establishing that the crewmen of the LADY MARK intended to bring the illicit substance into the United States.The LADY MARK defendants were all charged with conspiring to violate and violation of Section 955a. Defendants successfully moved to have the indictment dismissed. The district court assumed for purposes of the motion that the LADY MARK was a stateless vessel. The district court concluded that the Government's failure to establish a nexus between the United States and the stateless vessel deprived the court of jurisdiction. The Government appeals the dismissal.",drug offences,0
"The Reliance initially encountered the Persistence early on the morning of August 11, 1980. She was moving sluggishly and appeared lower in the bow than normal. These facts indicated that she was probably carrying something heavy on board. The vessel was listed under ""category 3"" by the Drug Enforcement Agency's El Paso Intelligence Center, meaning that she is suspected of illegal activities and should be boarded if possible.The Reliance attempted to contact the Persistence, but no one answered for two hours, although a man was seen in the cockpit. A man finally answered and identified himself as ""Charles Daniels"" (it was later discovered that no one by that name was on board). He said the vessel was the Persistence, her home port was Guernsey, her last port had been Bermuda, and her next port was Portland, Maine. ""Daniels"" expressed interest in a hurricane he said was in the area they had just left; the captain of the Reliance (Commander Bates) thought this unusual, as the hurricane was in the Caribbean, not near Bermuda.Bates contacted his operational commander and asked him to contact the British government to ask permission to board. He requested permission to board from ""Daniels,"" who refused. The U.S. State Department then sought permission to board from the British government. That afternoon, the State Department received a telegram from the U.S. Embassy in London, stating that the British authorities were ""nearly certain"" the Persistence was of U.K. registry, but to confirm it, the ""carved in the beam"" number should be checked. More importantly, it further stated that ""the U.K. authorities have granted authority to board and search subject vessel.""At 3:00 p. m. on August 11, Bates was informed of the British consent and told to board the vessel for purposes of determining and verifying its registration and determining the nationality of the persons on board. Bates informed the Persistence of the British consent; one of the defendants replied, ""Fine, come aboard,"" and an armed boarding party was sent over. Bates instructed them to check the registration number and verify it by locating the main beam number. The defendants — the only persons on board — presented their identification to the boarding party, as well as the vessel's papers, and a provisional U.K. registration (the vessel had earlier been registered in the United States). When asked to point out the main beam number, defendant Kincaid indicated a board on deck and then pointed to some seat cushions. It was not in either of these places, and indeed, it was unreasonable to think it could be, as the number is always placed on a permanent structural part of the vessel. Kincaid repeatedly said that it was not below deck, but when told that the boarding party would have to go below to find the number, he assented. He then slid open the hatch, and said, ""Looks like we've made history.""When the hatch was opened, plastic and burlap wrapped bales were visible, filling the lower compartment to within three feet of the overhead. The smell of marijuana was present. A search was made for the main beam number, but it could not be found. A bale was opened and tested positively as marijuana. Another search eventually revealed a main beam number, which was the number of the vessel's previous U.S. registry. The number would not have been visible from on deck.",drug offences,0
"The accused in this case, Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, is the Second Vice-President of Equatorial Guinea and the son of Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the President of Equatorial Guinea. He was accused of misappropriating state funds to support his lifestyle and failing to produce a ‘convincing justification of the origin of his fortune’, giving that his annual salary was under USD 100,000. He was accused of stealing USD 115 million while he was Minister of Forestry and Agriculture and taking the proceeds from a tax that he levied on wood sales. The proceedings against the accused originated in a complaint lodged by Transparency International France with the Paris public prosecutor in 2008. This complaint led to a criminal investigation of the accused. Notably, allegations of money laundering and corruption against the accused and his family had previously been investigated by the United States Senate, and a settlement of USD 30 million had been reached with the United States Department of Justice in a related case.The investigation of the accused was completed in 2016 and the Paris prosecutor laid criminal charges against the accused for money laundering. Seizure of the accused’s property in France was also ordered, including a building at 42 Avenue Foch in Paris. Following this order, Equatorial Guinea brought a case against France in the International Court of Justice seeking a suspension of the criminal proceedings and preventing France from seizing the building on the basis of diplomatic inviolability.",money laundry,0
"In November 1988 the applicant opened a bank account with an Austrian bank, bank G. The account was registered under his name and all movements on the account were able to be followed. By 1998 the applicant’s account had a positive balance of approximately 17 million euros (EUR). In 1994 the applicant was indicted in the United States on various drug and money laundering charges relating to drug trafficking on a particularly large scale, which he was involved in from 1982 until his arrest in 1994. The applicant entered into a Plea and Cooperation Agreement with the prosecution on 17 May 1994. Under that agreement, the applicant voluntarily forfeited to the United States approximately 50 million United States dollars (USD) in assets. He was also obliged to identify all his assets. However, the applicant did not disclose his account with bank G. While in prison the applicant was induced by one of the other fellow inmates, who was cooperating with the FBI, to bribe a judge. The inmate also arranged a meeting between the applicant and W., an undercover law-enforcement officer, who presented himself as being able to assist the applicant. Subsequently, W. arranged several money transfers for the applicant from bank G. in Austria. Thereupon, on 7 May 1998, the United States Department of Justice requested the Austrian authorities under letters rogatory to freeze the applicant’s assets as a preliminary step to forfeiture under US law, subject to the operation of Austrian law. It stated that the applicant’s funds deposited with bank G. were the proceeds of money laundering and drug offences to which the applicant had pleaded guilty in 1994. It further held that these funds had also been used in additional money laundering offences for which the applicant would be indicted later. This request was based on the treaty regulating judicial assistance between Austria and the United States, namely the Treaty of Mutual Legal Assistance (“the MLAT”), which entered into force on 1 August 1998. On 23 September 1999 the District Court for the Northern District of Florida issued a Final Order of Forfeiture including the applicant’s assets at bank G. (“the first forfeiture order”). Apparently, the applicant’s appeal against this decision was to no avail. In a second set of criminal proceedings in the United States, the applicant was indicted for conspiracy to bribe a federal judge, conspiracy to tamper with a witness, conspiracy to money laundering and for money laundering. On 1 February 2000 the District Court for the Northern District of Florida acquitted the applicant of bribery, but convicted him of all other charges. The court also ordered the forfeiture of his assets (“the second forfeiture order”). On 26 August 2004 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit partly granted the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 1 February 2000 and acquitted him with respect to money laundering. His conviction for conspiracy to tamper with a witness was affirmed. The court also reversed the second forfeiture order. Based on the United States’ letters rogatory of 7 May 1998, the Vienna Regional Criminal Court (Landesgericht für Strafsachen) issued an interim measure on 23 June 1998 enjoining the applicant from disposing of all assets deposited with bank G. Additional criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of money laundering on 19 June 1998. The matter proceeded to the European court of Human Rights with outcome deemed as Inadmissible.

"On 17 November 2002 Ismayilov arrived in Moscow from Baku. He was carrying with him 21,348 US dollars (USD), representing the proceeds from the sale of his ancestral dwelling in Baku. However, he only reported USD 48 on the customs declaration, whereas Russian law required that any amount exceeding USD 10,000 be declared to the customs. A customs inspection uncovered the remaining amount in his luggage. The applicant was charged with smuggling, a criminal offence under Article 188 § 1 of the Criminal Code, and the money was appended to the criminal case as physical evidence. On 8 May 2003 the a District Court of Moscow found the applicant guilty as charged and imposed a suspended sentence of six months’ imprisonment conditional on six months’ probation. As regards the money, it held it should revert to the State.The court examined the national law on confiscation, international commitments including under the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and constitutional issues such as proportionality and the right to property under the European Convention on Human Rights.",other crimes,1
"According to the Audiencia Provincial de Málaga (Provincial Court, Málaga), there is coherent evidence that, at some unspecified time in 1993, the shareholders and directors of the company Minerva agreed to import through the port of Setúbal (Portugal) lampante (refined) olive oil from Tunisia and Turkey, which was not declared to the customs authorities. The goods were then transported in lorries from Setúbal to Málaga (Spain). The defendants (Giuseppe Francesco Gasparini, Jose L.A Gasparini, Giuseppe Costa Bozzo, Juan de Lucci Calcagno, Francesco Mario Gasparini, Jose A. Hormiga Marrero, Sindicatura Quiebra) devised a system of false invoicing to create the impression that the oil came from Switzerland.The Audiencia Provincial de Málaga further states that the Supremo Tribunal de Justiça (Supreme Court of Justice, Portugal), in a decision on an appeal against a judgment of the Tribunal de Setúbal, found that the lampante olive oil imported into Portugal originated on ten occasions in Tunisia and on one occasion in Turkey and that a lesser quantity than was actually imported was declared to the Portuguese customs authorities.The Supremo Tribunal de Justiça acquitted two of the defendants in the case before it, on the ground that their prosecution was time-barred. They are both also being prosecuted in the main proceedings.The Audiencia Provincial de Málaga explains that it has to rule on whether an offence of smuggling can be found or whether, on the contrary, no such offence can be found having regard to the binding force of the judgment of the Supremo Tribunal de Justiça or to the fact that the goods were in free circulation in the Community.It was in those circumstances that the Audiencia Provincial de Málaga decided to stay the proceedings and refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.",other crimes,0
"On 7 November 2005, the Supreme Court of Cyprus has taken a significant decision with regard to the implementation and enforcement of the Framework Decision on European Arrest Warrant. The Supreme Court of the Republic of Cyprus upheld the decision of a District Court in an appeal brought before it by the Attorney General against that decision which concluded that the arrest of a Cypriot national and his surrender to the United Kingdom’s judicial authorities on the basis of a European arrest warrant, cannot be effected, as the national law transposing the Framework Decision into the domestic legal order is unconstitutional. The Constitution of Cyprus prohibits the extradition of Cypriot nationals to any other country. The two main arguments submitted by the Attorney General in the appeal, namely that the European arrest warrant procedures are not identical and do not amount to extradition procedures and, that, in any case the principle of the supremacy of Community law over the domestic legislation of the Member States should apply mutatis mutandis with regard to the law of the European Union, were rejected by the Court with the following reasoning: a. even though the nature of the European arrest warrant was discussed, mainly through references to the decision of the Polish Supreme Court on the same matter, the Court decided that irrespective of its nature and whether that amounts to extradition or not, it could not find an appropriate legal basis in the Constitution justifying the arrest of a Cypriot national for the purpose of surrendering him/her to the competent judicial authorities of another Member State on the basis of a European arrest warrant. The reasons justifying the arrest of persons are exhaustively enumerated in the Constitution and none of them may beinterpreted as allowing the arrest and surrender of Cypriot nationals to another member state. It could not therefore interpret national law in conformity with the law of the European Union. b. Framework decisions issued on the basis of Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union, are not directly effective. The expected results which are binding on the Member States, may be achieved only through transposition “with the appropriate legitimate procedures existing in each Member State”. According to the Court, this has not been done in Cyprus, as the provisions of the relevant legislation transposing the framework decision on the European arrest warrant are in conflict with the provisions of the Constitution. With this reasoning, theCourt concludes, even though not explicitly, that framework decisions may not beconsidered superior to the Constitution. Following the decision of the Supreme Court and taking into account the consequences this entails for the fulfillment of the obligations of the Republic of Cyprus under the Treaty on European Union, the Government has decided to proceed with the submission to the House of Representatives of a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution. In the meantime and until the Constitution is amended, the Cypriot competent authorities will not be in a position to execute any European arrest warrants issued by the competent authorities of other Member states, against Cypriot nationals.",other crimes,0
"In 1974, AGOSI, a joint stock company based in Germany,  began doing business with a British citizen, X. In the course of this business, between August 1974 and May 1975, AGOSI bought from X a large quantity of pre-1947 British coinage which had a high content of silver. However, it appears that unbeknown to the company the coins had been illegally exported from the United Kingdom. On Saturday, 2 August 1975, after normal business hours, X visited AGOSI’s factory with Y, whom he introduced as a wealthy businessman. Together they asked to make an immediate purchase of 1,500 Kruegerrands, gold coins minted in South Africa, where they are also legal tender, having a value of some £120,000. The sale was agreed and the coins were loaded into a car bearing United Kingdom number plates. Payment was accepted in the form of an unguaranteed cheque drawn on an English bank. The cheque bore no sign of having been cleared for exchange control purposes. On Monday, 4 August, the cheque was handed to AGOSI’s bank for collection. However, on 11 August, the bank notified AGOSI that the cheque had been dishonoured. The contract of sale contained a provision according to which ownership of the coins remained with AGOSI until full payment for them had been received by it. Meanwhile, on 2 August, the buyers attempted to smuggle the gold coins by car into the United Kingdom. The coins were, however, discovered hidden in a spare tyre and were seized by the customs authorities in Dover. On 16 April 1975, the importation of gold coins had been prohibited by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, by an amendment to the Open General Import License of 5 July 1973. The prohibition was withdrawn on 16 June 1979. On 14 August 1975, criminal proceedings were instituted in the United Kingdom against X and Y; they were charged, inter alia, with fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on importation of gold coins, contrary to section 304 (b) of the Customs and Excise Act 1952 (""the 1952 Act"").  On 18 and again on 28 August, AGOSI requested the Customs and Excise to return the coins on the basis that the company was their rightful owner and had been the innocent victim of fraud. On 20 August, officers of the Customs and Excise visited AGOSI’s factory in Germany to inquire into the circumstances of the sale. AGOSI continued to co-operate with the Customs and Excise throughout the criminal investigation. On 1 October, AGOSI made a declaration of avoidance of the contract of sale by virtue of which the sale of the coins became void ab initio under German law. On 13 October 1975, AGOSI’s lawyers wrote to the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, who had taken over responsibility for the case, requesting that the Commissioners exercise their discretion under section 288 of the 1952 Act (see paragraph 35 below) and return the coins to the company, as they did not constitute goods liable to forfeiture under the 1952 Act interpreted in the light of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (the Treaty of Rome).",other crimes,1
"The applicants, two Vietnamese nationals minors at the relevant time, were discovered by police to be working as gardeners in cannabis factories and criminally charged with the involvement in the production of a controlled drug. At the time, several national reports had found that Vietnamese children were particularly vulnerable to being trafficked into and within the United Kingdom and being exploited in such factories. The applicants were not immediately referred to a competent authority for assessment of their potential victims of trafficking status, but both were later determined to had been trafficked. The UK Crown Prosecution office nevertheless disagreed with this assessment and prosecuted the applicants for drug-related offences. More specifically, the first applicant was discovered by police at a sophisticated cannabis factory in Cambridge during the execution of a drug warrant. During his interview, he claimed that he had been smuggled into the UK by his adoptive father, that upon arrival he had encountered two Vietnamese nationals who took him to the address in Cambridge, and that, while he realised cannabis was being grown there, he had notknown that it was illegal. He was charged with being concerned in the production of a controlled drug and pleaded guilty on his counsel’s advice. A few days after the preliminary hearing, Refugee and Migrant Justice (a legal advice and representation charity) raised concerns that the applicant may have been the victim of human trafficking. One of the two Competent Authorities for identification of victims of trafficking considered the first applicant’s case and concluded that there were reasonable grounds for believing that he had been trafficked. The case was reviewed by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), but the Chief Crown Prosecutor confirmed that the first applicant should be prosecuted in the public interest. He was subsequently sentenced to twenty months detention in a young offenders’ institution. The second applicant’s investigation started when police officers attended a residential premises in London following reports of a suspected burglary, discovered a very sophisticated cannabis factory and found the applicant close to the premises, hiding from the marauders. During the police interview, the second applicant indicated that soon after his arrival in the UK from Vietnam he met a man (“H”) who gave him accommodation, clothes and food. He was then taken to work in the cannabis factory, where he was mainly locked in and unable to go out. He did not receive any compensation for his work. He claimed that in the beginning he did not know that the plants in the factory were illegal, but when he realized it and asked to leave, he received death threats. After the interview, he was charged with being concerned in the production of a controlled drug, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to an eighteen-month detention and training order.  A solicitor then referred his case to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children National Child Trafficking Advice and Information Line (NSPCC NCTAIL), that concluded that there were reasonable grounds for considering him to be a victim of child. His case was subsequently considered by one of the two Competent Authorities that reached the same conclusion. A psychologist was also instructed and concluded that he was suffering psychological distress as a result of multiple traumatic experiences as a minor, and his symptoms met the criteria for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and a major depressive disorder. His case was thus reviewed by the CPS, which remained firmly of the view that he was not a victim of trafficking and the public interest would require a prosecution. Both the applicants later appealed unsuccessfully, with the Court of Appeals only addressing whether the decision to prosecute had been an abuse of process. They further applied to appeal to the Supreme Court but their applications were refused, thus exhausting domestic remedies",trafficking in persons,1
"In September 2012 the victim, a Croatian national, filed a criminal complaint against the defendant, T.M, who allegedly had forced the victim into prostitution over several months in mid-2011.The defendant, a former police officer, initially contacted the victim thorough Facebook, stating he would find a job for her. Instead, he arranged for her to provide sexual services either in the flat rented by him or by driving her to the clients. He had made her give him half of the money she had earned from providing sexual services and had threatened her and punished her if she did not comply with his demands.At the end of 2012, the man was indicted and the applicant was officially given the status of victim of human trafficking. After an investigation, the man was brought to trial in 2013.However, the Municipal Criminal Court acquitted the defendant on the basis that it could not conclude T.M had forced or pressured the victim into prostitution. The courts found the applicant’s testimony incoherent and unreliable. They therefore concluded that the prosecution had failed to provide sufficient evidence for a conviction, and that the applicant had given sexual services voluntarily.An appeal by the State Attorney’s Office was dismissed in January 2014, while a constitutional complaint by the applicant was declared inadmissible in June of the same year.Relying in particular on Article 4 (prohibition of slavery / prohibition of forced labour), the applicant complained of the lack of a legal framework to deal with the issues raised by her case and about the official response to her allegations.The application was lodged with the European Court of Human Rights on 27 August 2014.The victim alleged that the national authorities had failed to effectively apply the relevant criminal-law mechanisms concerning her allegations of human trafficking and exploitation of prostitution. Specifically, the shortcoming related to the investigative process, which did not follow correct lines of enquiry and several witnesses were not called to testify. This led to the impunity of the defendant, T.M.In June 2020 the Grand Chamber delivered its decision. This concluded that the national criminal investigation and the criminal proceedings against the defendant were defective to such a degree that they amounted to a violation of procedural obligations under Article 4 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  As to the factual scope of the case, the Court notes that the applicant’s complaint raises issues of alleged impunity for human trafficking, forced or alternatively non-forced prostitution relating to a deficient application of the relevant criminal-law mechanisms. It is thus essentially of a procedural nature. This finding, as already stressed above, is without prejudice to the further assessment and conclusion as to the actual applicability and scope of protection guaranteed under the Convention for the acts complained of by the applicant.",trafficking in persons,1
"The applicants, three Russian nationals, were trafficked to Greece between June and October 2003. The applicants, having obtained visas from the Consulate General of Greece in Moscow, allege that the Consulate employees had been bribed by the traffickers to issue the visas in question. In September 2003, the third applicant was arrested by the Greek police on charges of prostitution. The applicant, upon informing the Greek police that she had been forced to work as a prostitute, was recognized as a ‘victim of human trafficking’ and, in October 2003, criminal proceedings were brought against three individuals. Two of these individuals were sentenced to unsuspended terms of five years and ten month’s imprisonment and ordered to pay 30 EUR to the applicant, for the crimes of criminal conspiracy, living on the earnings of prostitution and human trafficking by the Thessaloniki Court of Appeals in June 2011. The third individual in this case was acquitted. The First and Second Applicants complained to the Ermoupoli police that they were the victims of human trafficking in December 2003, identifying three individuals as their traffickers. An investigation was thus opened, and criminal charges were brought against these three individuals. The Athenian Criminal Court sentenced two of these individuals to prison terms for forgery, use of forged documents and falsification of certificates in March 2010, acquitting two other persons for the same charges. The convicted had their sentences commuted to a 10 EUR pecuniary penalty for each day of detention. In 2013, two individuals were acquitted on charges of forming a criminal organization and human trafficking by the same court. Furthermore, in May 2005, the applicants stated to the public prosecutor responsible for cases of human trafficking that the documents used to obtain the applicant’s visas at the Consulate General of Greece in Moscow contained false information, further accusing the Consulate employees and the hospitality companies involved of facilitating the transfer of the applicants to Greece. Criminal proceedings for human trafficking were subsequently brought against three consular employees, among others. These proceedings for human trafficking against two consular employees were found to be time-barred, however, by the Indictments Division of the Criminal Court in February 2016, and the proceedings against the third consular employee was dismissed due to a lack of substantial evidence of the offence in question by the same court.The applicants complained to the European Court of Human Rights in June 2010, that the Greek authorities had failed in their obligation to criminalise and prosecute human trafficking. The applicants complained that, in so doing, the Greek State had failed its obligations under Article 4 ECHR on the prohibition of slavery and forced labour.",trafficking in persons,1
"The applicants are 42 Bangladeshi nationals who live in Greece. They did not have work permits when they were recruited between October 2012 and February 2013 to pick strawberries on a farm in Manolada. They had been promised a wage of 22 euros for seven hours’ work and three euros for each hour of overtime. They worked every day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. under the supervision of armed guards. Their employers had warned them that they would only receive their wages if they continued to work. The applicants lived in makeshift shacks without toilets or running water.In February 2013, March 2013 and April 2013 the workers went on strike demanding payment of their unpaid wages, but without success. On 17 April 2013 the employers recruited other Bangladeshi migrants. Fearing that they would not be paid, 100 to 150 workers from the 2012-2013 season started moving towards the two employers in order to demand their wages. One of the armed guards then opened fire, seriously injuring 30 workers, including 21 of the applicants. The wounded were taken to hospital and were subsequently questioned by police.The two employers, together with the guard who had opened fire and an armed overseer, were arrested and tried for attempted murder – subsequently reclassified as grievous bodily harm – and also for trafficking in human beings. By a judgment of 30 July 2014, the assize court acquitted them of the charge of trafficking in human beings. It convicted the armed guard and one of the employers of grievous bodily harm and unlawful use of firearms; their prison sentences were commuted to a financial penalty. They were also ordered to pay 1,500 euros to the 35 workers who had been recognised as victims – that is, 43 euros to each of them. The two convicted men lodged an appeal against that decision. The appeal is currently pending and has a suspensive effect.On 21 October 2014 the workers asked the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation to appeal against the assize court judgment, arguing that the charge of human trafficking had not been examined properly. That request was dismissed and the part of the assize court judgment dealing with human trafficking became “irrevocable”.",trafficking in persons,1
"The applicants, Ms J., Ms G., and Ms C., are three Filipino nationals who were born in 1984, 1982, and 1972 respectively and live in Vienna (Mrs J. and Mrs G.) and Switzerland (Mrs C.). Between 2006 and 2009 all three applicants went to work as maids or au pairs in Dubai (the United Arab Emirates) for the same family or relatives of the same family. They allege that their employers took away their passports, ill-treated and exploited them. Notably, they were forced to work extremely long hours without being paid their agreed wages, were physically and emotionally abused and threatened.In July 2010, the applicants’ employers took them on a short trip to Vienna. Like in Dubai, their passports remained with their employers and they had to work from the early hours of the morning to midnight or even later, taking care of all the employers’ children and carrying out numerous domestic duties. A few days after their arrival, two of applicants were subjected to extreme verbal abuse when one of their employers’ children went missing at the zoo. Deciding that the violence towards them was likely to escalate at any time and that they could not continue working in such conditions any longer, they escaped with the help of an employee at the hotel where they were staying who spoke Tagalog, the first applicant’s mother tongue. The applicants subsequently found support within the local Filipino community in Vienna.About nine months later, the applicants contacted LEFÖ, a local, government-financed NGO actively involved in supporting the victims of trafficking in human beings in Austria. Assisted by the NGO, in July 2011 they filed a criminal complaint against their employers. Accompanied by the NGO, they were interviewed by police officers specially trained in dealing with victims of human trafficking, and described in detail what had happened to them and how they had been treated by their employers.On the basis of the police report, the public prosecutor’s office initiated an investigation under Article 104a of the Criminal Code which related to human trafficking. However, the investigation was discontinued in November 2011 as the prosecutor’s office found that the Austrian authorities did not have jurisdiction over the alleged offences, which had been committed abroad by non-nationals.The prosecuting authorities later also specified that the applicants’ complaints about their stay in Vienna – including having to look after children, wash laundry and cook food for no more than three days – did not in themselves amount to exploitation under Article 104a of the Criminal Code.In March 2012, the decision to discontinue the investigation was confirmed by the Vienna Regional Criminal Court, which added that there was no reason to prosecute if a conviction was no more likely than an acquittal. In its view, there was also no obligation under international law to pursue an investigation concerning events allegedly committed abroad.The applicants were subsequently granted a special residence and work permit for victims of human trafficking in Austria, and a personal data disclosure ban was imposed on the Central Register so that their whereabouts would not be traceable by the general public.The applicants alleged that they had been subjected to forced labour and human trafficking, and that the Austrian authorities had failed to carry out an effective and exhaustive investigation into their allegations. They argued in particular that what had happened to them in Austria could not be viewed in isolation, but had to be seen in the context of ongoing ill-treatment; therefore, the Austrian authorities had had a duty under international law to investigate also those events, which had occurred abroad.",trafficking in persons,1
"The applicants, two sisters (C.N. and V.), are French nationals, who were born in 1978 and 1984 respectively in Burundi. They left that country following the 1993 civil war, during which their parents were killed. They arrived in France in 1994 and 1995 respectively, through the intermediary of their aunt and uncle (Mr and Mrs M.), Burundi nationals living in France. The latter had been entrusted with guardianship and custody of the applicants and their younger sisters at a family meeting in Burundi. Mr and Mrs M. lived in a detached house in Ville d’Avray with their seven children, one of whom was disabled.The applicants were accommodated in the basement of the house and alleged that they were obliged to carry out all household and domestic chores, without remuneration or any days off. C.N. claimed that she had also been required to take care of Mr and Mrs M.’s disabled son, including occasionally at night. The applicants allege that they lived in unhygienic conditions (no bathroom, makeshift toilets), were not allowed to share family meals and were subjected to daily physical and verbal harassment. On 19 December 1995 the social action department for the Hauts de Seine department submitted a report on children in danger to the Nantes public prosecutor but, following an investigation by the police child protection team, it was decided not to take any further action.V. was a pupil in the Ville d’Avray primary school from 1995, then in the general and vocational adapted learning department (Segpa) of a Versailles secondary school from 1997. In spite of difficulties in integrating and learning French, she obtained good school results. When she returned from school she did her homework, then helped her sister with the domestic chores. The applicants claimed that they were physically and verbally harassed on a daily basis by their aunt, who regularly threatened to send them back to Burundi.On 4 January 1999 the association “Enfance et Partage” drew the attention of the Nanterre public prosecutor’s office to the applicants’ situation; on the following day the applicants ran away from Mr and Mrs M.’s home and were taken into the association’s care.The diplomatic immunity enjoyed by Mr M., a former Burundi government minister and a UNESCO employee, was lifted, as was that of his wife. During the preliminary investigation V. said that she had not dared to confide in the police in 1995 for fear of reprisals. In the context of the judicial investigation that was subsequently opened, C.N. and V. confirmed that their situation had gradually deteriorated since 1995, a point when “things were not (yet) going too badly” with their aunt. A medico-psychological report on the applicants found, among other things, that the psychological impact of the acts to which they had been subjected was characterised by mental suffering and, in the case of C.N., by an experience of fear and sense of abandonment, as the threat of being sent back to Burundi was synonymous in her opinion with a threat of death and abandonment of her younger sisters.By a judgment of 17 September 2007 the Nanterre Criminal Court found Mr and Mrs M. guilty of all of the charges brought against them (for both spouses, having subjected individuals to working and living conditions that were incompatible with human dignity by taking advantage of their vulnerability or state of dependence; and for Mrs M., aggravated assault2). However, following the judgment of the Versailles Court of Appeal on 29 June 2009, only the finding that Mrs M. was guilty of aggravated intentional assault against V. was upheld. Mrs M. was ordered to pay a criminal fine of 1,500 euros (EUR) and to pay V. the sum of one euro as compensation for non-pecuniary damage, in line with her claim. The public prosecutor did not appeal on points of law against that judgment. The appeals on points of law lodged by the applicants and by Mrs M. were dismissed on 23 June 2010 by the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation.Relying on Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment), V. alleged that she had been subjected to ill-treatment. Under Article 4 (prohibition of slavery and forced labour), the applicants submitted that they had been held in servitude and required to perform forced or compulsory labour. Lastly, relying on Article 13 (right to an effective remedy), they also claimed that no effective investigation had been carried out in response to their allegations. The application was lodged with the European Court of Human Rights on 23 December 2009.",trafficking in persons,0
"The applicants, two Vietnamese nationals minors at the relevant time, were discovered by police to be working as gardeners in cannabis factories and criminally charged with the involvement in the production of a controlled drug. At the time, several national reports had found that Vietnamese children were particularly vulnerable to being trafficked into and within the United Kingdom and being exploited in such factories. The applicants were not immediately referred to a competent authority for assessment of their potential victims of trafficking status, but both were later determined to had been trafficked. The UK Crown Prosecution office nevertheless disagreed with this assessment and prosecuted the applicants for drug-related offences. More specifically, the first applicant was discovered by police at a sophisticated cannabis factory in Cambridge during the execution of a drug warrant. During his interview, he claimed that he had been smuggled into the UK by his adoptive father, that upon arrival he had encountered two Vietnamese nationals who took him to the address in Cambridge, and that, while he realised cannabis was being grown there, he had notknown that it was illegal. He was charged with being concerned in the production of a controlled drug and pleaded guilty on his counsel’s advice. A few days after the preliminary hearing, Refugee and Migrant Justice (a legal advice and representation charity) raised concerns that the applicant may have been the victim of human trafficking. One of the two Competent Authorities for identification of victims of trafficking considered the first applicant’s case and concluded that there were reasonable grounds for believing that he had been trafficked. The case was reviewed by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), but the Chief Crown Prosecutor confirmed that the first applicant should be prosecuted in the public interest. He was subsequently sentenced to twenty months detention in a young offenders’ institution. The second applicant’s investigation started when police officers attended a residential premises in London following reports of a suspected burglary, discovered a very sophisticated cannabis factory and found the applicant close to the premises, hiding from the marauders. During the police interview, the second applicant indicated that soon after his arrival in the UK from Vietnam he met a man (“H”) who gave him accommodation, clothes and food. He was then taken to work in the cannabis factory, where he was mainly locked in and unable to go out. He did not receive any compensation for his work. He claimed that in the beginning he did not know that the plants in the factory were illegal, but when he realized it and asked to leave, he received death threats. After the interview, he was charged with being concerned in the production of a controlled drug, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to an eighteen-month detention and training order.  A solicitor then referred his case to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children National Child Trafficking Advice and Information Line (NSPCC NCTAIL), that concluded that there were reasonable grounds for considering him to be a victim of child. His case was subsequently considered by one of the two Competent Authorities that reached the same conclusion. A psychologist was also instructed and concluded that he was suffering psychological distress as a result of multiple traumatic experiences as a minor, and his symptoms met the criteria for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and a major depressive disorder. His case was thus reviewed by the CPS, which remained firmly of the view that he was not a victim of trafficking and the public interest would require a prosecution. Both the applicants later appealed unsuccessfully, with the Court of Appeals only addressing whether the decision to prosecute had been an abuse of process. They further applied to appeal to the Supreme Court but their applications were refused, thus exhausting domestic remedies",drug offences,1
"On 7 November 2008, the Tribunale di Catania (Catania District Court) (Italy) issued a European arrest warrant (‘the arrest warrant’) in respect of Mr Gaetano Mantello, for his arrest and surrender to the Italian authorities in the context of criminal proceedings instituted against him. That arrest warrant is based on a national arrest warrant isssued by the same court on 5 September 2008, in respect of Mr Mantello and 76 other co-accused.The arrest warrant is based on two alleged acts of Mr Mantello.He is accused, first, of having participated, between January 2004 and November 2005, in the framework of a criminal organisation comprising at least 10 other perrsons, in cocaine trafficking, organised in Vittoria, in other Italian cities and in Germany. It is alleged that Mr ­Mantello not only played the role of courier and middleman, but was also in charge of obtaining and dealing in cocaine. Under Article­74(1) and Article­74(3) of Decree No­309/90, those acts are punishable, under Italian law, by imprisonment for a minimum term of 20 years. Second, during that period and in the same places, acting alone or in concert with others, he is alleged to have unlawfully taken possession of, retained, transported, sold or disposed of cocaine to third parties. Those acts are punishable under Italian law by imprisonment for a term of between 8 and­20 years, a sentence which is liable to be increased. In that regard, Mr­ Mantello also faces charges of aggravated criminal conduct to the extent that the cocaine was supplied by the network to a minor. According to the information contained in the national arrest warrant, from January 2004 onwards various authorities investigated the unlawful trafficking in cocaine which was rife in the Vittoria region. The investigations took the form in particular of extensive telephone tapping which made it possible to bring to light the existence of an organised network, made up of two criminal organisations, resulting in the application of Article­74 of Decree No­309/90. In addition, during the tapping of telephone calls made by Mr­Mantello during the period from 19 ­January to 13­September 2005, his participation in the aforementioned network was confirmed. He was also shadowed by investigators during some of his journeys, including those between Sicily (Italy) and Milan (Italy) on 28­July and 12­August 2005 and between Sicily, Esslingen (Germany) and Catania on 12­September 2005. During that last-mentioned journey, Mr­ Mantello purchased 150­g of cocaine in Essslingen and, on his return in the evening of 13­September 2005, he was arrested, when alighting from the train at Catania station, by the railway police, who searched him and discovered that he was carrying two packets containing 9.5­g and­145.96­g of cocaine, equivalent to between 599 and­719 individual doses. By judgment of 30­November 2005, the Tribunale di Catania sentenced Mr­ Mantello to a term of imprisonment of 3 years, 6 months and­20 days and to a fine of EUR­13 000. In its indictment the Catania Public Prosecutor accused him of having been in unlawful possession, on 13­September 2005, of 155.46­g of cocaine, intended for resale. The Tribunale di Catania found those acts to be proved. At Mr­ Mantello’s request, the court gave judgment in abridged proceedings which enabled him to obtain a reduction in his sentence. By judgment of 18­April 2006, the Corte d’appello di Catania (Court of Appeal, Catania) upheld the judgment of that court. Subsequently, the Tribunale di Catania reduced Mr­  Mantello’s sentence, meaning that he in fact served a sentence of only 10 months and­ 20 days in prison, while his fine was also reduced. Having become aware, on 3 ­December 2008, of the arrest warrant on the Schengen Information System (SIS), the Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Stuttgart (Public Prosecutor’s Office, Stuttgart) had Mr­ Mantello arrested on 29 ­December 2008 at his home and brought before the Amtsgericht (District Court) Stuttgart. At the hearing, Mr­ Mantello opposed his surrender to the issuing judicial authority and did not renounce his claim to the specialty principle. On application by the Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Stuttgart, on 22­January 2009 the Oberlandesgericht (Higher Regional Court) Stuttgart requested the Italian authorities to examine to what extent the judgment of the Tribunale di Catania of 30­ November 2005 precluded execution of the arrest warrant. Not having received any information from those authorities, the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart then decided, on 20­March 2009, to suspend execution of the arrest warrant and, in view of the complex factual and legal issues raised by the main proceedings, assigned a lawyer to act for Mr ­Mantello. Subsequently and in response to a request for information from the executing judicial authority, the investigating judge at the Tribunale di Catania finally declared, on 4­April 2009, in his capacity as issuing judicial authority for the arrest warrant, that the judgment of 30­November 2005 did not preclude the criminal proceedings referred to in the arrest warrant and therefore that the case was not subject to the ne bis in idem principle. e Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Stuttgart thereupon requested the referring court to execute the arrest warrant. The Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart nevertheless enquires whether it may oppose execution of the arrest warrant issued in respect of the offences concerning organised crime since, in its view, the Italian investigating authorities, even at the time of the investigation which led to Mr­ Mantello’s conviction for possession of cocaine intended for resale, had sufficient evidence to charge and prosecute him in respect of the offences referred to in the arrest warrant, including organised drug trafficking. However, in the interests of the investigation, in order to be able to break up that trafficking network and arrest the other persons involved, the investigators did not pass on the information and evidence in their possession to the investigating judge or at that time request the prosecution of those acts. According to the referring court, under German law as interpreted by the Bundesgerrichtshof (Federal Court of Justice), a crime relating to participation in a criminal orrganisation may in principle still be the subject of a subsequent prosecution if, first, the earlier charges and judicial investigation concerned only individual acts of a member of such an organisation and if, second, the accused did not have a legitimate expectation that the earlier proceedings encompassed all the acts committed in the framework of that organisation. However, it appears that the referring court does not fully subscribe to the Bundesgerichthof’s position. It suggests a third condition, namely that, at the time of the judicial decision on the individual act, the investigators must have been unaware of the existence of other individual offences and of an offence relating to participation in a criminal organisation, which was specifically not the case so far as the investigating authorities in Italy were concerned. In addition, the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart notes that, first, in the main proceddings, there is no cross-border element since the potential ‘idem’ is constituted by a judicial decision emanating from the issuing Member State itself and not from another Member State. Second, that court notes that the concept of ‘same acts’ has not yet been the subject of a decision by the Court of Justice in the context of the European arrest warrant. e referring court enquires whether the case-law developed in the CISA context may be applied in a situation such as that in the main proceedings. In those circumstances, the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.",drug offences,0
"It is apparent from the order for reference that on or about 27 March 1983 Mr Van Straaten was in possession of a consignment of approximately 5 kilograms of heroin in Italy, that this heroin was transported from Italy to the Netherlands and that Mr Jean Leon Van Straaten had a quantity of 1 000 grams of that consignment of heroin at his disposal during the period from 27 to 30 March 1983. Mr Van Straaten was prosecuted in the Netherlands for (i) importing a quantity of approximately 5 500 grams of heroin from Italy into the Netherlands on or about 26 March 1983, together with A. Yilmaz, (ii) having a quantity of approximately 1 000 grams of heroin at his disposal in the Netherlands during or around the period from 27 to 30 March 1983 and (iii) possessing firearms and ammunition in the Netherlands in March 1983. By judgment of 23 June 1983, the Rechtbank ’s-Hertogenbosch ('s-Hertogenbosch District Court, Netherlands) acquitted Mr Van Straaten on the charge of importing heroin, finding it not to have been legally and satisfactorily proved, and convicted him on the other two charges, sentencing him to a term of imprisonment of 20 months. In Italy, Mr Van Straaten was prosecuted along with other persons, for possessing onor about 27 March 1983, and exporting to the Netherlands on several occasions together with Mr Karakus Coskun, a significant quantity of heroin, totaling approximately 5 kilograms. By judgment delivered in absentia on 22 November 1999 by the Tribunale ordinario di Milano (District Court, Milan, Italy), Mr Van Straaten and two other persons were, upon conviction on the charges, sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years, fined ITL 50 000 000 and ordered to pay the costs. The main proceedings are between, first, Mr Van Straaten and, second, the Netherlands State and the Italian Republic. The national court refers to an alert regarding Mr Van Straaten the legality of which is at issue in those proceedings, and which the national court examines in the light of the CISA. By order made on 16 July 2004, the Italian Republic was summoned to appear in the proceedings. Before the national court, the Italian Republic rejected Mr Van Straaten's claims that, by virtue of Article 54 of the CISA, he should not have been prosecuted by or on behalf of the Italian State and that all acts connected with that prosecution were unlawful. According to the Italian Republic, no decision was given on Mr Van Straaten's guilt by the judgment of 23 June 1983, in so far as it concerns the charge of importing heroin, since he was acquitted on that charge. Mr Van Straaten's trial had not been disposed of, within the meaning of Article 54 of the CISA, as regards that charge. The Italian Republic further submitted that, as a result of the declaration as referred to in Article 55(1)(a) of the CISA which it had made, it was not bound by Article 54 of the CISA, a plea which was rejected by the national court. No further information on the nature of the proceedings is given in the order for reference. According to the Netherlands Government, the judgment of the Rechtbank ’s-Hertogenbosch of 23 June 1983 was upheld by a judgment of the Gerechtshof te ’s Hertogenbosch (Regional Court of Appeal, ’s-Hertogenbosch) of 3 January 1984, which amended the terms of the second charge against Mr Van Straaten. TheGerechtshof te ’s-Hertogenbosch described the act as ‘voluntary possession of a quantity of approximately 1 000 grams of heroin in the Netherlands during or around the period from 27 to 30 March 1983’. The appeal on a point of law brought by Mr Van Straaten against that judgment was dismissed by judgment of the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden (Supreme Court of the Netherlands) of 26 February 1985. That judgment became final. Mr Van Straaten served the sentence imposed upon him. The Netherlands Government then states that in 2002, at the request of the Italian judicial authorities, an alert was entered in the SIS for the arrest of Mr Van Straaten with a view to his extradition, on the basis of an arrest warrant of the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office of 11 September 2001. The Kingdom of the Netherlands added to that alert a flag as referred to in Article 95(3) of the CISA, so that he could not be arrested in the Netherlands. After Mr Van Straaten had, in 2003, been informed of that alert and, therefore, of his conviction in Italy, he first requested, in vain, from the Italian judicial authorities the deletion of the data in the SIS concerning him. The Korps Landelijke Politiediensten (Netherlands National Police Services; ‘the KLPD’) stated to him by letter of 16 April 2004 that, since the KLPD was not the authority that issued the alert, under Article 106 of the CISA it was not authorised to delete it from the SIS. The Netherlands Government further states that Mr Van Straaten then applied to the Rechtbank ’s-Hertogenbosch for an order requiring the minister concerned and/ or the KLPD to delete his personal data from the police register. The national court found in an order of 16 July 2004 that, by virtue of Article 106(1) of the CISA, only the Italian Republic was authorised to delete the data as requested by Mr Van Straaten. In light of that fact, the court treated the application as an application for an order requiring the Italian Republic to delete the data. The Italian Republic was consequently joined as a party to the main proceedings. According to the Netherlands Government, the national court then found that, under Article 111(1) of the CISA, Mr Van Straaten had the right to bring an action before the competent court under national law challenging the entry by the Italian Republic in the SIS of data concerning him. Pursuant to Article 111(2), the Italian Republic would be required to enforce a final decision of the Netherlands court on such an action. It was in those circumstances that the Rechtbank ’s-Hertogenbosch decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling.",drug offences,0
"Mr Leopold Henri Van Esbroeck, a Belgian national, was sentenced, by judgment of 2 October 2000 of the Court of First Instance of Bergen (Norway), to five years' imprisonment for illegally importing, on 1 June 1999, narcotic drugs (amphetamines, cannabis, MDMA and diazepam) into Norway. After having served part of his sentence, Mr Van Esbroeck was released conditionally on 8 February 2002 and escorted back to Belgium. On 27 November 2002, a prosecution was brought against Mr Van Esbroeck in Belgium, as a result of which he was sentenced, by judgment of 19 March 2003 of the Correctionele Rechtbank te Antwerpen (Antwerp Criminal Court, Belgium), to one year's imprisonment, in particular for illegally exporting the above listed products from Belgium on 31 May 1999. That judgment was upheld by judgment of 9 January 2004 of the Hof van Beroep te Antwerpen (Antwerp Court of Appeal). Both of those courts applied Article 36(2)(a) of the Single Convention, according to which each of the offences enumerated in that article, which include the import and export of narcotic drugs, are to be regarded as a distinct offence if committed in different countries. The defendant lodged an appeal on a point of law against that judgment and pleaded infringement of the ne bis in idem principle, enshrined in Article 54 of the CISA. In those circumstances, the Hof van Cassatie (Court of Cassation) decided to stay the proceedings and refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.",drug offences,0
"In connection with an investigation conducted by the Italian and Netherlands authorities in cooperation, Mr Filomeno Maria Miraglia was arrested in Italy on 1 February 2001 under an order for his pre-trial detention issued by the examining magistrate of the Tribunale di Bologna. Mr Miraglia was charged with having organised, with others, the transport to Bologna of 20.16 kg of heroin, an offence laid down by and punishable under Articles 110 of the Italian Criminal Code and 80 of Presidential Decree No 309/90. On 22 January 2002 the examining magistrate of the Tribunale di Bologna committed Mr Miraglia to be tried for that offence and decided to replace his detention in prison by house arrest. The Tribunale di Bologna later replaced house arrest by an obligation to reside in Mondragone (Italy), and then revoked all detention measures, so that at present the defendant is at liberty. Criminal proceedings in respect of the same criminal acts were instituted concurrently before the Netherlands judicial authorities, Mr Miraglia being charged with having transported about 30 kg of heroin from the Netherlands to Italy. The defendant was arrested on that charge by the Netherlands authorities on 18 December 2000 and released on 28 December 2000. On 17 January 2001 the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam (Netherlands) rejected the appeal brought by the prosecuting authorities against the order of the Rechtbank te Amsterdam (Netherlands) dismissing their application for the defendant to be kept in custody. The criminal proceedings against Mr Miraglia were closed on 13 February 2001 without any penalty or other sanction's being imposed on him. In those proceedings the Netherlands public prosecutor did not initiate a criminal prosecution of the defendant. It is apparent from the file before the Court that that decision was taken on the ground that a prosecution in respect of the same facts had been brought in Italy. By order of 9 November 2001 the Rechtbank te Amsterdam awarded the defendant compensation for the damage suffered through his having been remanded in custody and also the costs of the lawyers instructed. By letter of 7 November 2002 the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Rechtbank te Amsterdam refused the request for judicial assistance made by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Tribunale di Bologna, taking as its ground the reservation formulated by the Kingdom of the Netherlands with regard to Article 2(b) of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, given that the Rechtbank had 'closed the case without imposing any penalty'. On 10 April 2003 the Italian Public Prosecutor requested the Netherlands judicial authorities to provide information about the outcome of the criminal proceedings against Mr Miraglia and the way in which the proceedings had been settled in order to assess their significance for the purposes of Article 54 of the CISA. By note of 18 April 2003 the Netherlands Public Prosecutor informed his Italian counterpart that the criminal proceedings against Mr Miraglia had been stayed, but did not supply information considered sufficient by the Italian court conquering the order made and its content. The Netherlands Public Prosecutor stated that it was 'a final decision of a court' precluding, pursuant to Article 255 of the Netherlands Code of Criminal Procedure, any prosecution in respect of the same criminal acts and any judicial cooperation with foreign authorities, unless new evidence should be produced against Mr Miraglia. The Netherlands judicial authorities added that any request for assistance made by the Italian State would run foul of Article 54 of the CISA. According to the Italian court, the Netherlands authorities decided not to prosecute Mr Miraglia on the ground that criminal proceedings against the defendant had in the meantime been instituted in Italy for the same criminal acts. That assessment is ascribable to the 'preventive' application of the principle ne bis in idem. Now, according to the Tribunale di Bologna, that interpretation of Article 54 of the CISA is mistaken, for it removes any real opportunity for the two States concerned to take action so that the defendant's responsibility could actually be examined. Indeed, Article 54 of the CISA, thus interpreted, would at the same time prevent the Netherlands authorities from prosecuting Mr Miraglia on the ground that proceedings were pending in Italy for the same acts, and the Italian authorities from determining whether the defendant was guilty. The Italian court adds that, even if it should not find, as the Netherlands authorities have done, a situation in which the principle ne bis in idem applied and should decide to continue the proceedings, it would be forced to determine Mr Miraglia's guilt or innocence without the important benefit of the evidence gathered by the Netherlands authorities or their judicial assistance. Those were the circumstances in which the Tribunale di Bologna decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.Outcome: the Court (Fifth Chamber) ruled as follows: The principle ne bis in idem, enshrined in Article 54 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders, signed on 19 June 1990 at Schengen, does not fall to be applied to a decision of the judicial authorities of one Member State declaring a case to be closed, after the Public Prosecutor has decided not to pursue the prosecution on the sole ground that criminal proceedings have been started in another Member State against the same defendant and for the same acts, without any determination whatsoever as to the merits of the case.",drug offences,0
"Case C-187/01 Mr Gözütok is a Turkish national who has lived for several years in the Netherlands. He runs a snack bar in the Netherlands town of Heerlen called the 'Coffee- and Teahouse Schorpioen'. In the course of searches of those premises on 12 January and 11 February 1996, the Netherlands police found and seised, on the first occasion, 1 kg of hashish, 1.5 kg of marijuana and 41 hashish cigarettes and, on the second occasion, 56 g of hashish, 200 g of marijuana and 10 hashish cigarettes. It is apparent from the documents before the Court that the criminal proceedings against Mr Gözütok in the Netherlands relating to the seisures on 12 January and 11 February 1996 were discontinued after he had accepted offers made by the Public Prosecutor's Office in the context of a procedure whereby further prosecution was barred and paid the sums of NLG 3 000 and NLG 750 demanded by the Public Prosecutor's Office in that connection. In that regard, Article 74(1) of the Wetboek van Strafrecht (Netherlands CriminalCode) provides: 'Before the start of the court proceedings, the Public Prosecutor may impose one or more conditions for avoidance of a prosecution of any offences, other than those subject by statute to imprisonment of a term of more than six years, or any misdemeanours. There shall be a bar on further prosecution once those conditions have been fulfilled.' Those conditions may include payment to the State of a sum of money between NLG 5 and the maximum amount of the fine which may be imposed in respect of the offence. The German authorities' attention was drawn to Mr Gözütok by a German bank which, on 31 January 1996, alerted them to the fact that large sums of money were passing through Mr Gözütok's account. Once it had obtained information about Mr Gözütok's activities from the Netherlands authorities, the German police proceeded to arrest him in Germany on 15 March 1996 and, on 1 July 1996, the Staatsanwaltschaft Aachen (Public Prosecutor, Aachen) (Germany), charged Mr Gözütok with dealing in narcotics in the Netherlands on at least two occasions, one involving significant quantities, during the period from 12 January to 11 February 1996. On 13 January 1997, the Amtsgericht Aachen (District Court, Aachen) (Germany) convicted Mr Gözütok and sentenced him to a period of one year and five months' imprisonment, suspended on probation. Mr Gözütok and the Public Prosecutor's Office both appealed against that decision and the Landgericht Aachen (Regional Court, Aachen), by order of 27 August 1997, terminated the criminal proceedings brought against Mr Gözütok on the ground inter alia that under Article 54 of the CISA the definitive discontinuance of criminal proceedings by the Netherlands authorities bound the German prosecuting authorities. According to the Landgericht, the criminal proceedings were discontinued after the Public Prosecutor's Office offered a compromise ('transactie'), a procedure under Netherlands Law which amounts to the case being finally disposed of ('rechtskräftige Verurteilung') for the purposes of the German version of Article 54 of the CISA, although such compromises do not entail the participation of a court and do not take the form of a judicial decision. The Public Prosecutor's Office appealed against the order of the Landgericht Aachen to the Oberlandesgericht Köln [Higher Regional Court, Cologne], which, taking the view that the outcome of the proceedings turned on the interpretation of Article 54 of the CISA, decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling.",drug offences,0
"The applicant is a heavy gambler on horses and often held large sums of money in cash for this purpose. Apart from his winnings, the applicant also inherited a large sum in cash from his father in 1990 and in 1992 realized a substantial profit on the sale of a house which he bought and had refurbished. The applicant states that he has never been convicted of any drugs related offences and maintains that he was wrongly prosecuted and convicted in relation to the handling of cash stolen from a post office in 1985. He was given a five-year prison sentence and was released in 1988. In July 1994, and in order to avoid off-course betting duty, the applicant decided to open an account under a pseudonym with a specialist bookmaker who conducted business inside racetracks. The applicant on occasions attended race meetings carrying large sums of money. According to the applicant, in July 1994 he had, mainly through his winnings, over GBP 600,000 available to him for betting. The applicant also used his bookmaker’s account for placing bets over the telephone. Such bets were deemed to be off-course bets and were thus subject to tax. Having ascertained that he could avoid tax on off-course betting by gambling off-shore as a non-resident, the applicant decided to buy property in Spain and contacted a lawyer in Spain to this end. The applicant arranged a meeting with the lawyer in Spain for 23 September 1996. After the meeting the applicant intended to go to a race meeting in Paris. Having discovered that his partner’s brother, H, was intending to take a holiday in Spain, and being nervous about taking the money himself, the applicant enlisted H’s help in taking GBP 240,000 to Spain as a favor. According to the applicant, he wanted to look at properties in southern Spain in the price range GBP 40,000 to GBP 150,000 and required the rest for the race meeting in Paris. The applicant arranged to meet H in Spain. On 17 June 1996 H, who was driving a hired car, was stopped at Portsmouth by a Customs and Excise Officer. When asked how much cash he was carrying, H replied GBP 500. A subsequent search of the boot of the car revealed GBP 240,000 in a green hold-all. H stated that the sum in question belonged to a friend who was meeting him in Spain. H was subsequently questioned about the money by Customs and Excise officials. H stated that the money belonged to the applicant, that he was taking it out of the country for the applicant, that the latter wanted to use it to buy an apartment in Spain and that he was travelling to Madrid and Barcelona. The money seized was sent for forensic testing and the sum of GBP 239,010 was deposited with the Midland Bank on 20 September 1996. The applicant contacted the Customs and Excise authorities to reclaim the money and attended voluntarily for interview on 4 October 1996 together with his solicitor. On that occasion the applicant was told that he was not under arrest. He answered the questions put to him and gave permission to examine his bank accounts as well as his account with his bookmaker. An order for the detention of the applicant’s money was granted by Portsmouth Magistrates’ Court on 19 September 1996 on application of the Customs and Excise authorities pursuant to section 42(2) of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994. A further order was made on 17 October 1996. In February 1997 the Customs and Excise authorities made an application under section 43(1) of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 for the forfeiture of GBP 239,010 seized from the applicant on the grounds that its officers believed that the money was directly or indirectly the proceeds of drugs trafficking and/or was intended for use in drug trafficking.",drug offences,1
"On 27 June 1996, at Newport Crown Court, the applicant was convicted of being concerned in the importation in November 1995 of a large quantity of cannabis resin, contrary to section 170(2) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. On 12 July 1996 he was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment in respect of this offence. The applicant had previous convictions, but none in respect of a drug-related offence. An inquiry was conducted into the applicant’s means, pursuant to section 2 of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 (“the 1994 Act” – see below). On 15 May 1996 a Customs and Excise appointed drug financial investigation officer advised the applicant’s solicitors that he was carrying out an investigation into their client’s financial affairs and that he wished to interview him in order to assist the court in determining whether he had benefited from drug trafficking. The applicant declined to take part in the interview.  The investigation officer prepared a written statement pursuant to section 11 of the 1994 Act which was served on the applicant and filed with the court. In the statement the investigation officer observed that the applicant had no declared taxable source of income, although he was the registered owner of a house converted into four flats from which he had started a bed-and-breakfast business in December 1991. Examination of the applicant’s building society account showed cash and cheque deposits in the period from August 1994 to November 1995 totaling over 17,000 pounds sterling (GBP), which the investigation officer suggested might represent rental income from the four flats. The applicant was found to have become a director of a newsagents business in July 1992 of which his parents were the sole shareholders and to have bought a shop in September 1992 for GBP 28,493.25, of which GBP 12,200 was paid in cash. He was the registered owner of five cars, of an estimated total value of approximately GBP 15,000, and was found to have spent GBP 2,000 on a BMW 520i in October 1995, and approximately GBP 88,400 on expenses related to the November 1995 importation of cannabis (in respect of which he had been convicted). The investigation officer concluded that the applicant had benefited from drug trafficking and that the total benefit was GBP 117,838.27.",drug offences,1
"Between 1983 and 1987 a number of incidents gave rise to concern over the adequacy of the applicant company's security procedures at Heathrow Airport, London:Between November 1983 and September 1984 a series of consignments, believed by Customs and Excise to have contained drugs, disappeared from the Air Canada transit shed. In March 1986 809 kilograms of cannabis resin were discovered in a consignment from India (New Delhi). In May 1986 a consignment from Thailand which had been taken out of the controlled area, was intercepted and found to contain 300 kilograms of cannabis resin. Two Air Canada staff were subsequently convicted of offences connected to the importation of cannabis resin. On 11 June 1986 Customs and Excise wrote to the applicant company's Cargo Terminal Manager expressing concern about the large quantities of drugs being smuggled into the country with the assistance of Air Canada staff. In its reply Air Canada promised to improve its security. On 15 December 1986 Customs and Excise wrote to all airline operators at Heathrow and Gatwick warning them about the possible penalties if illegal imports were discovered aboard their aircraft. The letter stated, inter alia, that where an aircraft was used for the carriage of anything liable to forfeiture the Commissioners ""will consider exercising their powers under the law, including the seizure and forfeiture of aircraft or the imposition of monetary penalties in lieu of such forfeiture"". On 31 December 1986 Customs and Excise wrote again to the applicant company informing it that £2,000 would be deducted from Air Canada's bond pursuant to section 152 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (""the 1979 Act"") for earlier breaches of security. Between November 1986 and January 1987 another consignment was removed from the Air Canada transit shed without proper authority and the applicant company failed to inform Customs and Excise for a considerable time. It was decided to deduct £5,000 from Air Canada's bond. On 26 April 1987 a Tristar aircraft owned and operated by the applicant company and worth over £60 million, landed at Heathrow Airport, London, where it discharged cargo including a container which, when opened, was found to contain 331 kilograms of cannabis resin valued at about £800,000. The airway bill number of the container was false, the applicant company's cargo computer did not hold any details of the consignment and no airway bill had been drawn up and despatched for it.The aircraft was on a regular scheduled flight starting in Singapore and travelling to Toronto landing en route at Bombay and Heathrow. It was carrying both fare-paying passengers and cargo. On the morning of 1 May 1987 officers of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise (""the Commissioners"") acting under powers conferred by section 139 (1) of the 1979 Act seized the aircraft as liable to forfeiture under section 141 (1) of the same Act. Passengers were waiting to board the aircraft. On the same day the Commissioners, acting under powers contained in section 139 (5) and paragraph 16 of Schedule 3 to the 1979 Act, delivered the aircraft back to the applicant company on payment of a penalty, namely a bankers' draft for £50,000. No reasons were given to the applicant company at the time for the decision either to seize the aircraft or to levy the penalty. It was only during the course of proceedings before the European Commission of Human Rights that the Government offered the earlier security problems (see paragraph 6 above) as an explanation for the actions of the Commissioners.On 20 May 1987 the applicant company gave notice of a claim disputing that the aircraft was liable to forfeiture. The Commissioners therefore brought condemnation proceedings before the court to confirm, inter alia, that the aircraft was liable to forfeiture at the time of seizure.The case was finally brought to the european Court of Human Righs (all proceedings are explained in detail under relevant sections).",drug offences,0
"On 3 November 1986 Mr Welch was arrested for suspected drug offences. On 4 November he was charged in respect of offences concerning the importation of large quantities of cannabis. Initially Mr Welch was not charged with possession of cocaine with intent to supply. However, following further investigations and  forensic examinations, on 24 February 1987 the applicant was charged with the offence of possession with intent to supply cocaine alleged to have been committed on 3 November 1986. Later, on 5 May 1987, he was additionally charged with conspiracy to obtain cocaine within intent to supply in respect of activities which occurred between 1 January 1986 and 3 November.On 24 August 1988, Mr Welch was found guilty on five counts and was given an overall sentence of twenty-two years’ imprisonment. In addition, the trial judge imposed a confiscation order pursuant to the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (""the 1986 Act"") in the amount of £66,914. In default of the payment of this sum he would be liable to serve a consecutive two years’ prison sentence. The operative provisions of the 1986 Act had come into force on 12 January 1987. The Act applies only to offences proceedings for which were instituted after this date. On 11 June 1990 the Court of Appeal reduced Mr Welch’s overall sentence by two years. In addition it reduced the confiscation order by £7,000 to £59,914.",drug offences,1
"On 28 July 1979, Mr Amosi Salabiaku, a Zairese national residing in Paris, went to Roissy Airport to collect a parcel which he had been informed by telex message was to arrive on board an Air Zaïre flight. According to the applicant, he expected the parcel to contain samples of African food sent to him through the intermediary of one of his relatives who was an Air Zaïre employee. As he was unable to find it, he approached an airline official who directed him to a padlocked trunk which had remained uncollected and bore an Air Zaïre luggage ticket but no name. The official, acting on the advice of police officers watching the trunk, suggested that he left it where it was, intimating to him that it might contain prohibited goods. The applicant took possession of it nevertheless, and passed through customs without difficulty. He had chosen to go through the “green channel” for passengers having nothing to declare. He was accompanied by three other Zaïrese nationals whom he had met there for the first time. Immediately afterwards he telephoned to his brother Lupia to come and meet him at a terminal near their home in order to help him since the package had proved heavier than expected. Customs officials then detained Mr Amosi Salabiaku and his three companions as they were about to board the Air France terminal coach. Mr Salabiaku identified himself as the person for whom the trunk had been intended and denied that it was anything to do with his three compatriots who were immediately released. Customs officials forced the lock of the trunk and found, lying underneath victuals, a welded false bottom which concealed 10 kg of herbal and seed cannabis. The applicant asserted that he was unaware of the presence of the cannabis and that he had mistaken the trunk for the parcel of whose arrival he had been advised. His brother was also arrested at the Porte Maillot (Paris). On 30 July 1979, Air Zaïre telephoned to Mr Amosi and Mr Lupia Salabiaku’s landlord, informing him that a parcel bearing the applicant’s name and his address in Paris had arrived by mistake in Brussels. It was opened by an investigating judge but was found to contain only manioc flour, palm oil, pimento and peanut butter. Mr Amosi and Mr Lupia Salabiaku were released on 2 August 1979 and, together with a certain K., also a Zaïrese national, were charged with both the criminal offence of illegally importing narcotics and the customs offence of smuggling prohibited goods. Consequently, the court imposed on Mr Amosi Salabiaku a sentence of two years’ imprisonment and a definitive prohibition on residing in French territory. Furthermore, in respect of the customs offence, it imposed on him a fine of 100,000 French francs (FF), under Article 414 of the Customs Code, to be paid to the customs authorities",drug offences,1

"The case involves members of an underground community of internet users that produced and distributed illicit pirated copies of recently released movies in violation of property rights. The defendants were identified by the Federation Against Copyright Theft (“FACT”), an association of studios, etc, during an investigation that included web monitoring in 2012. Each of the defendants, including Sahil Rafiq and Reece Daniel Baker, played a different role in the conspiracy, but each accepted that their illicit activities resulted in a loss of at least GBP 1 million to property right holders.Rafiq was involved from July 2010 until February 2013. After having previously run the release group “DTRG,” he started running another one under the name “26K” by 2012. After being identified by FACT, he accepted that he was responsible for all of the activities of the group since he was its leader. While the exact number of pirated motion pictures is not known, the review of just four torrent sites revealed that 26K had released 885 films, of which over half were copied from DVDs and Blu-rays. Evidence suggests that Rafiq had been editing copies himself in order to prepare them for release and that he had been working together with his co-defendants, especially with Baker who had, inter alia, provided him with audio.Baker also started as member of the DTRG release group in October 2011. He left the group to form his own under the name “Goon,” which he operated until he subsequently took control of another group “Hope” or later named “Resistance.” His groups specialised in releasing copies that had previously been recorded in the cinema by so-called “cammers.” His group paid cammers to obtain the first copies of various films, including “Skyfall” and “Argo” which had been recorded abroad and for which the group paid USD 100. The review of four torrent sites suggests that he had been involved in the release of 310 movies, over half of which were recorded in the cinema. He sometimes worked together with three of his co-defendants.The defendants Rafiq and Baker were both arrested and searched by law enforcement authorities on 1 February 2013. After being interviewed, Baker was released on bail. He then bought new equipment under his girlfriend’s name, as his had been seized by the authorities, and re-offended. In July 2013, FACT identified his recent activities, and the police searched his home again and re-arrested the defendant.Rafiq and Baker, together with three co-defendants who had lesser roles, were tried for conspiracy to defraud. The were all sentenced in the Crown Court at Wolverhampton on 17 December 2015. Rafiq and Baker were sentenced to four years and six months' and four years and two months' imprisonment respectively. Graeme Reid and Ben Cooper were each sentenced to three years and six months’, and Scott Hemming to two years’ imprisonment.

"This case involves offences related to the setting up and operation of websites which facilitated the viewing of mostly recently released filmed in breach of copyright and the advertising revenue acquired from this illicit activity. From April 2008 to April 2013, the defendant, Paul Mahoney, created and operated a series of websites which enabled internet users to view films and TV series. The users just had to log onto the sites, which allowed them to stream the particular motion picture or TV episode free of charge recently after or before they had been released.The defendant created websites known as Bedroommedia, and later Fastpasstv, on which links to 12,139 films were available at one time. The links were acquired in one of three ways:1. Users had developed and submitted the links, which were later approved by the defendant or his staff. 2. The defendant developed a Scrapper software that searched other sites for films and TV shows and automatically recorded the links to them. 3. The defendant developed a software to search other sites, in particular Usenet, a site where promotional copies of movies were made available, for unreleased films. The films were subsequently downloaded to the website “Wootly,” a free video hosting service. The defendant was then able to add links to Wootly to his own website.The majority of the material was, therefore, not hosted on his own sites but rather by third party sites that were often placed abroad in order to avoid legal action against them. The defendant did not act alone but employed staff and paid them for their services. The staff help him maintain, develop, and improve the websites. He also had other employees acting as moderators or administrators, assisting him with running the websites.According to chat messages between the defendant and his employees, the websites were making more than GBP 1,000 per day from advertising. Likewise, from mid-2010 until February 2011, the defendant’s site had been viewed on over one million occasions.In 2007, the Federation Against Copyright Theft (“FACT”), the trade association of the film industry, took note of the defendant’s website and serve a Cease-and-Desist notice on 10 August 2008. The notice was ignored, and the defendant redirected the users to a new website. On 25 March 2011, law enforcement searched his residence, seized several items and arrested the defendant. After being released on bail, the defendant re-offended and was re-arrested on 19 December 2011. The website was shutdown on 2 April 2013, which is when the defendant stopped receiving advertising revenue from the site.Mahoney was ultimately sentenced to a four year Determinate Custodial Sentence, comprising two years custody and two years on licence, for conspiracy to defraud as well as acquiring and concealing criminal property on 8 September 2015.

"The four appellants (Bradley David Rogers, Colin Martin Samuels, Geraldine French, and Mark Julian Bell) were charged and convicted for their roles in two advance fee frauds. Both frauds were operated by Muldoon (not included in the appeal), who pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to defraud and was sentenced to 7 years and 5 months’ imprisonment. Muldoon employed UK nationals at call centers in Spain or Turkey in either an advance fee fraud scheme that involved debt elimination or an advance fee fraud scheme that involved escort services. These debt elimination and escort services were promoted and advertised online on websites and offline in the national press. UK consumers responded to these advertisements and paid an advanced fee to receive the advertised services. For the escort services fraud, the consumers were asked to pay for a registration fee in order to secure a date and obtain escort services. Once the so-called registration fee was paid, the date with the escort was cancelled and no other dates were made available. The debt elimination fraud involved employees from the call centers cold-calling UK consumers from a list the centers purchased from data providers.

The second appellant, the wife of the first appellant, was only under investigation for money laundering offences.The investigation had begun in 2008 after a whistle blower had made allegations against the first appellant and others. Following the investigations, Kuwait sought a restraining order in Switzerland, which was granted, and USD 100 million were restrained in Swiss bank accounts belonging to the first appellant and his family.Information recovered as a result of proceedings in Switzerland, appeared to show that the first appellant and his family had transferred some of the money derived from illegal commission payments to other countries, including the United Kingdom.

"Between December 2006 and May 2007, large quantities of falsified prescription-only medicines entered the United Kingdom wholesale pharmaceutical market. The medicines were purportedly French medicines that had previously been for sale in France. In reality, the medicines were manufactured in China and imported to the United Kingdom via Hong Kong SAR, Singapore and Belgium.The falsified medicines in this case were Casodex (bicalutamide), a treatment for advanced prostate cancer; Plavix (clopidogrel), a treatment for ischemic heart disease, used to prevent heart attacks; and Zyprexa (olanzapine), a treatment for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other severe mental conditions.The defendant, Peter Gillespie, ran a UK-based company by the name of Consolidated Medical Supplies (CMS). He did so in breach of an order disqualifying him from acting as a company director. He acquired medicines from a company he owned and operated in Luxembourg by the name of Kirchberg Handels GmBH. This company did not hold a European Economic Area (EEA) wholesale dealer’s licence. This company also purported to obtain goods from certain companies in Mauritius which did not hold wholesale dealers’ licences. The falsified medical products in this case had been purchased by Kirchberg Handels GmBH for GBP 1.4 million and were to be sold as legitimate medical products with a retail value of GBP 4.7 million.The offending in this case took place over the course of nine importations. The imported medicines were delivered to warehouses of CMS disguised as parallel-traded medicines. The defendant then altered the presentation of the medicines. At CMS premises in Basingstoke, UK, he caused vignettes (that is, stickers) for each medicine to be printed by a specialist printer. Such vignettes were required for eligibility for a reimbursement scheme in France. Additionally, the medicines were packed in cardboard packing boxes that had been procured to match as closely as possible the brown packing boxes used by the genuine manufacturer. Finally, white stickers with French text were applied on the outside of the cardboard packing boxes. Each of these steps was taken by the defendant to give the impression to purchasers that the medicines had been procured in France and were genuine French medicines. The medicines were then sold to unaware licensed wholesalers who supplied the medicines in good faith to hospitals, clinics and care homes. In total, 72,000 packs containing 2.1 million doses of falsified medicines entered the UK supply chain.On 8 April 2011, Mr Gillespie was convicted and sentenced in the Crown Court at Croydon of one count of conspiracy to defraud, three counts of supplying a medicinal product without marketing authorisation, three counts of selling counterfeit goods, and one count of acting as a company director when disqualified.

"Each of the four defendants is alleged to have steered a rigid hulled inflatable boat (RHIB) filled with a number of migrants from France to the UK. Each boat in the four cases aimed to enter the UK without the correct documentation. Each appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to section 25 of the Immigration Act 1971 for “Assisting unlawful immigration”. Three of the cases involve convictions by a jury, and in the fourth, the applicant pleaded guilty.Defendant Bani- On 1st June 2019, Mr. Bani was one of six individuals – five adults and one child – on board a RHIB which was crossing the English Channel. The UK Border Force Coastal Patrol Vessel intercepted the boat and observed that the defendant was piloting the boat for approximately two minutes. UK border force examined Mr. Bani’s phone when he was arrested and found that the handset user had been involved in the purchase of a RHIB in April and another in May and had researched weather conditions in the Channel during the 48 hours or so prior to the relevant crossing on 1st June 2019.Defendant Mohamoud Al Anzi- On 10th June 2020, Mr. Al Anzi was onboard a RHIB, along with twelve others, which was intercepted crossing the English Channel by a UK Border Force Coastal Patrol Vessel. He was found to be one of at least two people who steered the boat. He claimed the reason he wanted to migrate was because he was a Kuwaiti national who had fled the country in order to avoid the authorities due to him taking part in anti-government protests. His journey involved travelling from Germany to France and it was here that he was found unable to pay for passage to the UK. To continue his journey, Mr Anzi agreed to steer the boat in exchange for continuing his journey without any extra cost. Due to the assigned driver making an error, the boat began to spin dangerously. The defendant went to steer the boat and stop it from spinning. He then steered the boat towards the UK for around 20 minutes. The assigned driver then took over and drove the rest of the way.Defendant Fariborz Taher Rakei-On 7th September 2020, Mr. Rakei, along with thirteen others, were attempting to cross the English Channel by boat when they were stopped by the UK Border Force. On 16th September 2020, he was arrested for assisting unlawful immigration. When interviewed, he admitted that he had piloted the RHIB during the crossing, but he only did so under duress because he was threatened by the smugglers whom he paid to make the journey to the UK. He stated that he had paid EUR1500 to the smugglers to travel to the UK.  He had not wanted to make the crossing by boat, but the smugglers told him that this was the only option available to him. According to his testimony, several smugglers were armed. He faced violence at the hands of the smugglers such as being hit in the face with the handle of an axe then dragged into the water, put onto the boat and told to steer it. He said that he was genuinely scared for his safety but felt that he had no choice but to steer the boat. Despite having previous military training and experience as a lifeguard, he denied that he had told the smugglers about this and that he had been given a cheaper passage if he offered to steer the boat. However, having such experience did mean he felt responsible for keeping the others safe.Defendant Ghodratallah Zadeh- On 13th July 2020, Mr. Zadeh was intercepted by a UK Border Force whilst onboard an RHIB in the English Channel. There were thirteen people on board (twelve adults and one child). The defendant was identified as the driver. UK Border Force found aerial footage which confirmed that Mr. Zadeh was the driver. He also had no identification documentation. The defendant’s fingerprints were matched to an asylum claim in Switzerland. It was found that the defendant had previously driven the boat three or four times. However, he alleges that he didn't know how to pilot the boat, and the organizers of the journey told the migrants to just head for Dover. He said that he paid the organizers EUR 500 and that he would pay a further £500 through his family. His attempt to travel to the United Kingdom was a result of his application for asylum in Switzerland being refused.",smuggling of migrants,0

The substantial income brought by this activity to the network is estimated to be several dozens of millions Euro. An organisation of logistics particularly elaborated has been brought into light during the surveillances, using several vehicles, to numerous smugglers using discrete ways of communication and to illegal money laundering financial schemes. Hashem Saleh BAZLAH appears to have a central role as well on the national territory as in other European countries. The offenses continued from August 1, 2018 to January 21, 2020 in Le Mans, in Chatellerault, on the French national territory as well as within the European Union.

"On 22 October 2019, 39 migrants died while being smuggled across The Channel inside an airtight trailer, from which they had no means of escape as it could only be opened from the outside. Each victim paid between £10,000-£13,000 for their place in the container. The victims were of Vietnamese nationality, aged between 15 and 44, 8 of them were females and the remaining 31 were males. The cause of death was confirmed to be a combination of hypoxia and hyperthermia, as they had been sealed inside the trailer between 38C and 40C heat for 12 hours. Some of the victims reassured their families that they had paid extra for a so-called VIP journey to the UK – which meant the lorry driver was helping them to cross the border, and there was no need for them to break into vehicles and stow themselves away. However, the involvement of the lorry drivers offered them no protection when too many people were packed into one container.The early morning of that same 22 October 2019, the victims, who had respectively been at safe houses in Paris, Brussels and Dunkirk, made their way by taxi to a rural location close to an industrial estate in Bierne, in Northern France. From there, later that morning, they were picked up by one of the conspirers using the airtight refrigerated container of the trailer. The refrigerator was, and remained, switched off the entire time of the journey. After a short stop at Lissewege in Belgium, the conspirer that was driving the lorry, delivered it to Zeebrugge (Belgium) at around 2pm. By 3pm it had been loaded on to a freighter which sailed at around 4pm. From the pick up the temperature inside the trailer began to rise and continued to rise, whilst at the same time the amount of oxygen in the air began to decrease and the carbon dioxide in it began to increase. The temperature eventually rose to around 40 degrees whilst they were at sea – forcing the removal by the victims of their outer clothing in an attempt to cope with the situation. Those inside the container began to overheat and struggled to breathe. There were desperate attempts to contact the outside world by phone (reflected in the recordings that were played in court) and to break through the roof of the container to get fresh air. All were to no avail and before the ship reached Purfleet they had all died what must have been an excruciating slow death. After a second conspirer had collected the container in the early hours of 23 October, he received a message on Snapchat from the key-organizer telling him to stop and give the migrants some air as soon as he left the port in Essex. When the lorry driver opened the container doors it was too late: they were all dead. He waited 30 minutes before calling the police after he saw the dead bodies.In just the fortnight between the 10th and 23rd October 2019 there were four episodes of transportation involving, in total, over 80 migrants – 30 of whom arrived in the United Kingdom, around 20 of whom were stopped at Coquelles, and 39 of whom were unlawfully killed whilst in transit. Had they all arrived safely their value to the overall conspiracy would have been in the order of £800,000.This same smuggling network appears to have operated internationally. Typically, their modus operandi was the following one: first, the Vietnamese migrants would get in touch, via word of mouth, with a Vietnamese man called “Fong” who was based in London.  Arrangements would then be made to assemble the migrants at a safe house or houses on the continent. They would then be taken by taxis to one of a number of remote locations inland from the channel, in this case the Vietnamese migrants were taken in Belgium. There they would board a trailer hauled by a lorry, and would be given instructions as to what to do to minimise the risk of detection. The lorry would then either haul the container to the UK via the Eurotunnel terminal at Coquelles, or haul the trailer to the port of Zeebrugge in Belgium where it would be left and thereafter loaded onto a freighter and transported across to the port at Purfleet in Essex, where it would be collected by another lorry.  Upon arrival in this country, the migrants would be transferred from the trailer to smaller vehicles and driven to a safe house or houses in London, where they would be detained until a fee of around £10-13,000 was paid (often by relatives in Vietnam).",smuggling of migrants,1
"The decision regards the appeal against the decision of a District Judge made at Westminster Magistrates' Court, ordering the appellant’s extradition to France. The appellant was the subject of a conviction European Arrest Warrant (EAW), issued by the Regional Court of Lille (France) for (i) participation in a criminal organisation, and (ii) facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence. He was alleged to have been the principal of an organised network of smuggling of migrants to Great Britain, which he directed by telephone from the United Kingdom.On 5 and 6 December 2011, he was convicted in his absence by the Criminal Court of Lille and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, all of which remain to be served. He is entitled to a re-trial on his return to France.The EAW was issued on 20 March 2013 and certified by the National Crime Agency on 28 October 2013. He was arrested on 8 July 2014. The appellant was born in Kurdistan. He escaped persecution in Iraq by being smuggled into the United Kingdom, where he arrived in 1999. He allegedly suffered considerable mis-treatment including physical and sexual abuse while staying in State institutions. At a certain stage, he escape and ended up in France where he engaged in activities aimed at facilitating the illegal entry of migrants in the country. He was convicted twice in France for migrant smuggling and served custodial sentences. He later returned to the United Kingdom. He is currently married, with children, and works in a car wash. He was paid very little but his income made a significant difference to the family’s budget. The appellant has learning difficulties and a story of depression and health issues. He had already tried to commit suicide. In ascertaining the facts, the Court relied on the testimony of the appellant and his wife as well as expert evidence (regarding the appellant’s mental health). The representative of France was also heard and provided evidence, notably in regard of France’s capacity to set up preventive measures to protect the appellant from suicide Legal findings: The District Judge Westminster Magistrates' Court determined the execution of the EAW and the surrender of the appellant to France.

"In November 2015 in Saudi Arabia, the victim was employed by Mr Basfar, a member of the diplomatic staff of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In August 2016 she was brought to the United Kingdom to continue working for him there. To obtain a visa to enter the country, the victim was provided with an employment contract stating that she was employed by Mr Basfar to work a maximum of eight hours a day, with one day off each week and one month off each year; she was to be provided with sleeping accommodation and paid the national minimum wage.After arriving in the UK, the victim alleged that she was confined at all times to Mr Basfar’s house except to take out the rubbish. She was held virtually incommunicado, being allowed to speak to her family only twice a year using Mr Basfar’s mobile telephone. She was made to work from 7am to around 11.30pm each day, with no days off or rest breaks, and was required to wear a door-bell at all times so that she was at the family’s beck and call 24 hours a day. She was shouted at incessantly and regularly called offensive names. When the family was at home, the victim was only allowed to eat their left-over food; if they were out, she could cook something for herself.After arriving in the UK, the victim was paid nothing for seven months until Mr Basfar and his wife took her with them to Jeddah on their holiday in July 2017: during this trip she was paid 9,000 Saudi Riyals (approximately £1,800) for six months in one lump sum. After that, she was not paid again.In May 2018, the victim managed to escape.",trafficking in persons,0
"This case relates to three cases listed together. All appellants claimed to be victims of trafficking (VOT) and thus argued that they should not be punished for the alleged crimes in accordance with section 45 of the national Modern Slavery Act 2015. AAI, originally from Sierra Leone, is a victim of the Sierra Leonean civil war. He and his parents were abducted by the Revolutionary United Front (“RUF”). He stated that he was raped and seriously assaulted by various men. His parents were murdered. He had been trafficked as a child soldier. After he eventually escaped, he met T in Freetown where he worked for him. He washed his feet and worked for him at the beach. In return, T promised to help him with accommodation and education. This was, however, never fulfilled. AAI claimed that T, who he feared, organised his journey to the UK via Gambia in a lorry, in return AAI would have had to send him money from Europe. AAI claimed to be under T’s psychological control. AAI arrived in the United Kingdom (UK) on 20 May 2003. His asylum claim was refused on 17 July 2003 and his asylum appeal dismissed on 17 December 2003. Since for his removal from the UK a valid Emergency Travel Document (ETD) was necessary, he had to attend an interview at the Sierra Leonean High Commission. There, he did not answer questions by stammering and shaking, and he indicated that he was not a Sierra Leonean national. Moreover, he stated that he feared for his safety in Sierra Leone. Following this, the Secretary of State for the Home Department issued a notice under section 35 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004 requiring him to attend the interview and fully cooperate. He did not comply with the notice. AAI was thus convicted of failing to take actions as required by the Secretary of State, and he was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment. On 18 April 2013, he made an additional claim for asylum and an application to revoke the deportation order which was rejected; he thus appealed. Eventually, in December 2016, he was referred to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) and on 22 February 2017, the Single Competent Authority (SCA) made a positive reasonable grounds decision that the appellant is a VOT, followed by a positive conclusive grounds decision on 11 January 2019. AAH, a Nigerian national from the Yoruba tribe, escaped from a proposed marriage arranged by her father. She left Nigeria in August 2007 with the help of an agent and made the arrangement that she would reimburse him for the ticket by working. However, she escaped the house to where she had been taken. In 2009, the man contacted her and threatened her by indicating that he wanted his money returned. Following this, AAH was introduced to another man who groomed her for the purpose of sexual exploitation. After finding her a job in a care home, he took her wages. On 28 May 2015 she attended an interview for a job as a care worker with Care Management Group Ltd. She presented a French ID card and passport which were not her own, and she was subsequently offered the job. Following an enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service by the company after seven months, it became apparent that the documents were false. She thus was arrested at her workplace on 15 February 2016. On arrest, she provided the police with her address, where her genuine Nigerian passport confirming her true identity was found. On 15 March 2016, she pleaded guilty to a single count of possession of an identity document with improper intention, to make a gain for herself or another and was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment. Dated 20 July 2017, the SCA took a positive conclusive grounds determination as to AAH being a VOT. AAD, originally from Vietnam, suffered from ill-treatment and abuse during his childhood and employment. After he had left Vietnam in 2002 due to persecution by authorities, he lived in Laos until 2016. Since he was offered the opportunity to leave Laos with the prospect of a better life and employment, he paid $16,000 for being relocated to Germany. With the help of his family who obtained the remaining money from a “loan shark”. He flew from Laos to Hong Kong, and then to Russia. He had to pay an additional $9000 for his transportation to the United Kingdom, where he arrived in November 2016. On arrival, he was beaten up and told he owed an additional $700 which his family were required to raise. He was taken to London, given a mobile telephone and consequently abandoned by his traffickers. Through one of his acquaintances, he found work at several restaurants for approximately 7 months. After his work ended, a man called A Tu found him work at a construction site in Liverpool where he only stayed for a short period of time. He was then placed to an address in Stoke on Trent, where AAD believed he was offered cleaning work. However, he was instructed to tend and cultivate cannabis plants. On 4 October 2017, the appellant was arrested after he was seen approaching and entering the property where 353 cannabis plants were cultivated. On 15 February 2018, the appellant pleaded guilty to producing a controlled drug of class B contrary to section 4(2)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment. AAD claimed asylum on 8 March 2018 and requested a reference to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) as a victim of trafficking on 4 June 2018 which ultimately resulted in a conclusive grounds decision on 1 February 2019.",trafficking in persons,0
"This case concerns two Albanian women, M.D. and E.H., who are both victims of trafficking in persons for sexual exploitation. They are both single mothers who were trafficked from Albania to the UK and were sexually exploited. At the time of the proceedings, they were receiving support in the UK under the support regime for victims of trafficking. They have also sought for asylum and been recognised as refugees. Their dependent children were forced to listen to their abuses during Home Office interviews, because childcare was not available. During the appointments the women had to give specific details with regards to the sexual violence and abuse they were subjected to, in the presence of their children.",trafficking in persons,0
"In March 2012, Victim 1, a national of the Philippines, obtained employment through an agency for Mr. & Mrs. Aljaberi in Abu Dhabi. Victim 1 performed domestic and childcare work from 7 am to 10 pm every day. Though the terms of her employment guaranteed US$400/month, Victim 1 was paid around US$200/month. Mr. Aljaberi obtained a diplomatic position at the United Arab Emirates Embassy in London in 2013. As he wanted Victim 1 to accompany the family to London, he promised her that she would work a 40-hour week and earn £1,000/month, which she agreed to.The Aljaberi family obtained a Tier 5 visa as an overseas domestic worker for Victim 1 on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship from the Embassy which stipulated a salary of £1,000/month. As such, the visa was tied to her employment with Mr. & Mrs. Aljaberi, and if she left this employment, she would have no right to stay in the UK. Victim 1 testified that without this promise about her hours and pay she would not have come to the UK.Mr. Aljaberi moved to London and later, on February 1, 2013, Mrs. Aljaberi, the children and Victim 1 followed. Despite the promise from Mr. & Mrs. Aljaberi and the stipulations of her Certificate of Sponsorship from the Embassy, Victim 1 was required to work 14-15 hours every day and was remunerated only £100 to £200/month.Victim 1 alleges that, in London, she was mistreated for a variety of reasons. She was required to work many more hours and earned a much smaller salary than she had been promised. Victim 1 was not allowed to keep her own passport, and did not have access to medical care when she was sick (even though Mr. Aljaberi had told her that she was covered by medical insurance). Her movement was restricted and she was sometimes locked in the house, and was not allowed to leave the home without permission and (except in limited circumstances) unless accompanied.Victim 1 left the Aljaberi family on May 1, 2013. The police initially refused to investigate the Victim’s claims, arguing that the Aljaberis had diplomatic immunity; the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) refused to prosecute because they did not believe Victim 1 had been exploited. Victim 1 appealed and applied for judicial review.",trafficking in persons,1
"On 22 July 2011, Appellant, aged sixteen, entered the United Kingdom legally on a visit visa. He remained in the UK after the expiration of this visa.Appellant claimed that his step-grandmother brought him to the UK under the pretense of furthering his education, but instead exploited him for the purpose of cheap labour in a series of Asian food shops.Appellant feared that he would be harmed by his family if he were returned to Pakistan.In September 2012 the police became aware of Appellant and referred him to social services. On 25 September 2012 he claimed asylum. He participated in a child screening interview on 9 October 2012, and a child asylum interview on 13 November 2012. He produced a witness statement on 12 November 2012.On 29 November 2012, social services made a formal referral of Appellant to the Competent Authority (“CA”) under the National Referral Mechanism (“NRM”).The NRM operates through the Home Office under the authority of the Secretary of State (“Home Secretary”).On 1 February 2013, CA found no reasonable grounds to consider Appellant a victim of trafficking. This CA based its decision on the belief that Appellant was not brought to the UK for the purpose of exploitation.On 15 February 2013, Appellant requested a review of the negative reasonable grounds decision. On 22 February 2013, CA upheld its decision.On 26 April 2013, Appellant filed for judicial review.On 1 August 2013, the Home Secretary refused to grant Appellant asylum, and, the following day, issued a decision to remove Appellant from the UK. Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (FTT). FTT dismissed the appeal on 3 December 2013 based on its conclusion that Appellant’s case did not amount to forced labour, but, rather, an unfortunate choice based on economic necessity. On 13 January 2014, FTT denied a request for appeal to the Upper Tribunal (UT), and on 18 February 2014, UT denied a request to appeal.On 1 April 2014, CA issued a negative reasonable grounds reconsideration decision, again stating that Appellant was not brought to the UK for the purpose of exploitation in forced service or labour.On 23 April 2014, the High Court granted Appellant’s request for judicial review regarding the negative reasonable ground decision.

"​In early 2014, while the Claimant was working at a shop in Tirana, Albania, she was approached by a man (“Mr. X”) with whom she engaged in an initially consensual sexual relationship.  The Claimant was married to another man at the time of the affair with Mr. X, and in June 2014, after observing the Claimant and Mr. X together in a car, her husband, along with the rest of her family, threatened to kill the Claimant and disowned her. The Claimant remained under the protection of Mr. X in a hotel and at a house. Mr. X offered the Claimant a “new life” and began to manipulate her into trusting him so that he could sexually exploit her. From June to December 2014, Mr. X forced the Claimant to have unprotected sex with four to five men each day. She was regularly beaten and raped by Mr. X and others. She eventually became pregnant. She had no family, no ability to communicate with the outside world, and no access to medical care.  In December 2014, Mr. X allowed the Claimant to flee because the police were coming. The Claimant did not seek police assistance for fear that she would be returned to Mr. X or imprisoned. Instead, she travelled to a friend’s house, where she called her father, who again threatened her life. On 7 January 2015, the Claimant’s friend and friend’s husband helped the Claimant escape from Tirana in a lorry. On 16 January 2015, after arriving in the U.K., the Claimant sought assistance from the Bristol Red Cross. On 6 February 2015, the Claimant was referred to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) by the Bristol City Council as a possible victim of human trafficking. “Reasonable grounds” were found in favour of a finding that the Claimant was, indeed, a victim of human trafficking. On 10 January 2017, the Home Secretary informed the Claimant that the Home Department had received records showing that the Claimant had travelled with her passport from Albania to Italy on 3 April 2014. The Claimant denied that she had travelled to Italy and asserted that Mr. X had seen her passport prior to the alleged trip, and that she had not possessed her passport since leaving Albania.  On 25 April 2017, the Home Secretary issued a negative “conclusive grounds” decision regarding the claimant’s victimhood status. This decision was challenged by judicial review, but then settled between the parties. The Home Secretary agreed to withdraw and reconsider the decision. On 10 August 2018, the Home Secretary issued another negative conclusive grounds decision due to the passport entry into Italy. The Claimant’s counsel then retained an expert independent law enforcement consultant, Mr. Steve Harvey, who issued a report on 12 October 2018 stating that it wouldn’t be difficult for somebody to leave Albania using somebody else’s passport. He also confirmed that Mr. X used the prevalent “lover boy” mechanism of recruitment in forcing the Claimant into prostitution. On 17 October 2018, the Claimant demanded that the Home Secretary withdraw the second negative decision, and reconsider the decision given the new evidence in Harvey’s report. On 31 October 2018, the Home Secretary responded, declining to reconsider the matter. The Home Secretary referred to the NRM policy document: Victims of modern slavery – Competent Authority guidance (the “CA guidance”), stating that the Claimant could request reconsideration via a first responder or support provider, but could not directly request reconsideration by the Single Competent Authority (SCA), i.e. the Home Department. If the first responder or support provider then decided to refer the request to the home department, then the new evidence could be considered. The Home Secretary went on to say that unless the Claimant followed these procedural steps, her case would not be reconsidered, regardless of the availability of new evidence.",trafficking in persons,1

"In this Appeals case in front of the Royal Court of Justice, D seeks leave to appeal against her sentence and conviction, and Maione seeks to appeal against her conviction. Both Applicants claimed to have been victims of human trafficking and sought to rely on the statutory defence afforded to victims of human trafficking under the Modern Slavery Act (2015) Section 45. The Appeals Court, in this case, deals with the common issue raised by the two unrelated appeals as to whether the legal or persuasive burden of proof to establish every element to the defence rests on the defendant or whether it is the prosecution’s responsibility to disprove one or more elements of the defence to the criminal standard. The UK Government, as the Appellant, submits that the defendant is best placed to identify his/her situation and provide evidence for fulfilling the elements of the defence than the prosecution. The Respondent, the Government of the United Kingdom “Regina”, submits that the prosecution is in a far better position to establish the facts than the defendant.The Court’s reasoning especially considers the situation of a child victim, concluding that the practical difficulties involved in proving elements such as age would impede the  protective aims of the Act. Additionally, the Court considers that frequently victims use the defence of duress and the defence provided under Section 45 of the Modern Slavery Act in parallel. The Court notes that the Section 45 defence bears a close resemblance to that of the duress defence. The Court establishes that it would be impractical for the jury to assess both defences based on the same facts while applying different tests. In defence of duress, the burden of proof rests on the prosecution. Conclusively, the Court establishes that in line with Article 4 ECHR and the Directive 2011/36 EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and its victims, which underpin the Modern Slavery Act, the burden on proof falls on the prosecution. Based on this reasoning, the Appeals Court concludes that a reverse burden of proof would undermine the protection that Section 45 is designed to afford to vulnerable victims of human trafficking.",trafficking in persons,1

"This case concerns a Nigerian National who appealed against a decision of the United Kingdom Border Agency, whereby the UKBA determined that, on the balance of probabilities, the applicant had not been the victim of human trafficking.The applicant claimed that she had been trafficked from Nigeria to Portugal by a family friend known as “P.”, under the false pretence of legitimate work in Portugal. The applicant left Nigeria around December 2003, and she claimed that upon arrival in Portugal she had been taken to a brothel and told that she would have to work as a prostitute.The applicant stated that she had escaped her captors in Portugal and fled to Spain in 2006, where she claimed asylum. However, the Spanish authorities had not dealt with her claim immediately and she was left without accommodation for several days. The applicant then phoned another lady she had lived and worked with, who told her that their captors had hired an assassin to harm the claimant’s family in Nigeria. This news frightened the claimant, and thus she returned to her captors in Portugal.In 2009, the applicant arrived in Dublin with a false passport and attempted to use it to fly to Canada. She was detected and detained for carrying false documents. She tried to claim asylum in Ireland, but she was returned to Spain in February 2010. The claimant maintained that upon arrival in Spain she fell back into the hands of her captors and was again forced to work as a prostitute in Madrid.Soon thereafter the applicant was assisted to fly to Ireland again by another individual named “K.” She was again detected by immigration and immediately returned to Spain. The applicant claims that she reported her situation to the Spanish authorities on her return to Spain, but they did not take her claims seriously.K. helped the applicant to get to Ireland again around summer 2010. She arrived at Shannon airport, where the Immigration Officers told her that they would try to investigate her case. The applicant claims that she fled to Belfast in October 2010, because she met an associate of P., her trafficker, who threatened her, at a store in Dublin. In March 2011, through the help of the Belfast City Mission, the applicant instructed a solicitor. The Belfast City Mission also took the applicant to the police to report human trafficking.On the 19th of August 2011 the United Kingdom Border Agency issued a conclusive grounds decision wherein it decided that on the balance of probabilities the applicant had not been the victim of trafficking in human beings.

The interviews revealed that he may have been brought into England in a freezer container in 2010 (although he had previously been removed from the UK in 2009 after making two attempts to enter illegally). T.H.N. alleged that he was the trafficking victim, however, UKBA gave a negative decision at the reasonable grounds stage (see the commentary section for more details). T.H.N. pleaded guilty to producing a controlled drug in the Bristol Crown Court in 2012. He was sentenced to a detention and training order for 12 months. While in custody, the appellant met the Children's Commissioner. A further referral was made to the competent authority which this time made a positive reasonable grounds decision. T.H.N. was released from the sentence and put into the care of the local authority. However, a few days later T.H.N. went missing and it was believed that he had been re-trafficked. By then, T.H.N. had waived privilege and instructions had been taken from him, and the appeal to the Court of Appeal was pursued in his absence on the basis of those instructions.The prosecution first challenged T.H.N.'s appeal application by noting that a number of features of the case pointed away from the conclusion that he had been the trafficking victim. However, having considered a new report on errors made by the competent authority, the prosecution reconsidered its position and stated that had the evidence which was now available been available at the time of the original judgment, there would have been no prosecution.  The Court of Appeal agreed that there was powerful evidence that T.H.N. was a trafficked child and that his criminal activities were integral to the circumstances in which he was a victim. The Court quashed the conviction, stating that if the appellant had been prosecuted, an abuse of process argument would have been likely to succeed.R v. T.In 2009, T. was arrested in a house where a sophisticated cannabis growing operation was discovered. T. denied that he was tending the plants, and asserted that he was just looking after the house while the owner went to a party. The Crown Court considered T.'s age and concluded that he was an adult aged between 18 and 21 years. The later found birth certificate indicated that T. may have been less than 18. However, later at a retrial at the Crown Court, it was concluded that T. was at least 18 years old. T. was convicted and sentenced to two years detention in a Young Offenders' Institution for the offence of cultivating cannabis.The Court of Appeal noted that until after conviction of T., no proper consideration was given to the question whether T. had been the trafficking victim. In 2012, the competent authority concluded that T. had been a child victim of trafficking. It was said that T.'s presence as a gardener in the cannabis factory formed part of the process in which he was victimised. Further, the Court stated that a series of inconsistencies in the explanations provided by T. at different stages could not be determinative of T.'s age, nor indeed whether he was the trafficking victim.On the basis of the evidence, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal.R v. H.V.N.In May 2012, police officers attended a house in Mansfield after having been alerted by local residents who had seen H.V.N. being removed from the house with his hands bound by a group of men. The police found H.V.N. nearby, barefoot and frightened. Inside the house a large quantity of cannabis was being grown as a professional operation. H.V.N. was arrested and admitted that he had been in the premises and was looking after the crop. He knew it was cannabis but initially did not know it was illegal.An age assessment concluded that H.V.N. was just under 17 years old. At first, it was not considered whether H.V.N. may have been the trafficking victim. The competent authority later decided that H.V.N. may have been the trafficking victim, however, this positive reasonable grounds decision was for some reason not presented at the Court. H.V.N. pleaded guilty to producing cannabis and was sentenced to eight months of defention. The Court of Appeal noted that the guilty plea was tendered in ignorance of the important fact that the positive reasonable ground decision was made before H.V.N. pleaded guilty. The Court also noted that if the Crown Court had been fully informed on the facts now available, the case would have been stopped as an abuse of process. The appeal against conviction was allowed.R v. L.This case concerned a Ugandan woman around 30 years old. In early 2011, the authorities concluded that L.'s Portuguese passport was forged and L. was arrested while applying for a national insurance number.In an interview, L. said that she had been in the UK for seven years and came from Uganda. She was born in Portugal and had travelled to the UK on the promise of finding work as a child minder, using a false passport from Uganda. She said that she had been held captive in England and forced into prostitution for several years. When she had been released by her trafficker, she had been given a Portuguese passport which she believed was genuine.L. was advised by her solicitor to plead guilty to the charge she faced to avoid more serious sentence if the police concluded that her account was false. Following her guilty plead, L. was sentenced to six months imprisonment for possession of a false identity. While in custody, the Poppy Project began a detailed investigation of the case. It argued that there was powerful evidence that L. was the trafficking victim. This opinion was also supported by the competent UKBA authority.The Court of Appeal decided that given L.'s prolonged exposure to involuntary prostitution and forced control, the offence she had actually committed has arisen as a result of her being the trafficking victim. The Court also concluded that it appeared that L. truly believed that a forged passport was genuine, and the use of it represented a step in a process by which she would escape her situation.The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal.",trafficking in persons,0
"E.K. appealed to an Immigration Judge against the Secretary of State’s decision to remove her from the United Kingdom, claiming that she was a victim of human trafficking and would be at risk on return to Tanzania.The appellant (E.K.) had worked as a cleaner for Mrs Z.A. and her husband in Tanzania for two years. Mrs Z.A. tricked the appellant into accompanying into the UK, under the false pretence of a supposed surgery she was going undergo in the UK, and after which she would need the appellant’s assistance during her convalescence. However, shortly after her arrival, E.K.was left in the United Kingdom with Mrs Z.A.´s parents, Mr and Mrs Dhanji. The appellant was then told that she would be working for Mr and Mrs D. from then on. The appellant worked from 7 o’clock in the morning until 10.30 in the evening and was expected to clean the house thoroughly every day, massage Mrs D. twice a day, deal with the laundry, cook, garden and prepare Mr and Mrs D. for bed. She only had three breaks for food in the day when she ate leftovers and stale bread, and she was required to sleep on a thin mattress on the kitchen floor, although there was an unused spare bedroom in the house. Her living conditions were extremely poor and she did not receive any wages nor was she given any time off.  She was also required to work on demand at the homes of the D.´s relatives. Initially she was not allowed to attend church but was later permitted to do so. The appellant’s passport was kept by the D. family. Although she asked to be allowed to return to Tanzania on a number of occasions she was told that she could not do so until at least July 2007. She was not allowed contact with her family by telephone as they said it was too expensive. The appellant worked for Mr and Mrs D. between July 2006 and May 2007. One day she was approached at church by a member of the congregation who took her to see Mrs M.K., who  informed the Tanzanian Embassy about the appellant’s situation. The Tanzanian Embassy contacted Mr and Mrs D. to tell them that the appellant would not be returning to their employment, and the appellant stayed with Mrs M.K. at her home. However, conditions at M.K.’s household were little better than before. The appellant was manipulated by M.K. and required to work as a domestic worker for her. Again she was often required to sleep on a mattress on the floor. The appellant stayed with Mrs M.K. for three years between May 2007 and May 2010, until she was referred to the Poppy Project by Kalayaan, a charity which gives advice and support to migrants who enter the United Kingdom on a domestic worker visa. She was given accommodation by the Poppy Project, but by this time her health was very poor due to the abuses and the poor conditions she had endured while working for the D. family, and subsequently at Mrs M.K.´s household.",trafficking in persons,0
"All of the family members were found guilty of conspiracy to require victims to perform forced or compulsory labour.The family owned a caravan park and forced the victims to work for little compensation and subjected them to degrading treatment. The victims were vulnerable and often homeless, and were made to work for the family business as labourers. What each of the victims had in common was that, when they first met the Connors, they had been unemployed and addicted to alcohol. Most had been homeless, relying on hostels or night shelters at best for their accommodation. Some had suffered from mental health difficulties. All had been vulnerable in some way.The difference between the lifestyles of the defendants and the workers was marked; the work done reaped rich rewards for the Connors family, who lived luxuriously in caravans or houses. On the other hand, the workers, whose labour helped generate these rewards and who had originally been promised regular income, were underpaid or did not receive their salaries at all.Workers spoke of violence being meted out by certain bosses on different occasions. In particular, punches and slaps had been the weapons used by the defendant James John Connors to stop insubordination and emphasize hierarchy and control.The evidence did not suggest that violence had regularly been used against workers and rarely during the indictment period.The vast majority of the workers, however desperate they were for a roof over their head, realized that the conditions were very bad, they were at risk of violence and the promised pay was not going to materialize. They escaped by running away during the night or by disappearing when they were not being observed.",trafficking in persons,0
"In 2002, the applicant C.N. travelled to the UK from Uganda to escape the sexual and physical violence. Her relative S., who lived in London, helped her obtain a false passport and a visa to enter the UK, but on C.N.’s arrival he took these documents away and did not return them to her. In early 2003, a certain M. arranged for C.N. a job as a live-in carer for an elderly Iraqi couple (Mr. and Mrs. K). The job was emotionally and physically demanding, with C.N. being on-call twenty four hours a day and having only one afternoon per month off. C.N.’s wages were sent to M., who would then pass on a percentage to S. C.N. would only occasionally receive a small amount of money from S. C.N. was constantly warned by S. and his partner H. not to speak with anyone and threatened by denunciation to the authorities.In August 2006, C.N. decided to go to a local bank to alert the police to her situation. Before the police arrived, she collapsed in public, and was later diagnosed with HIV and psychosis. Following her discharge from hospital, C.N. was housed by the local authority and made an application for asylum, which was later rejected on the grounds that the applicant could access protection in Uganda to prevent further sexually motivated attacks and that the applicant could have tried to escape from S. earlier. Her appeal was dismissed, with the Judge expressing serious concerns about C.N.’s credibility and finding much of her account to be implausible.In April 2006, C.N.’s solicitor wrote to the police, asking them to investigate her case. The investigation into the applicant’s complaints was commenced by the Metropolitan Police Human Trafficking Team. In September 2007, they informed the applicant’s solicitor that there “was no evidence of trafficking for domestic servitude”. Likewise, in September 2008, they noted that “there was no evidence to substantiate the applicant’s allegation that she had been trafficked into the UK. She had been well looked after by the K family, although there had been a dispute over money and it may have been that her cousin kept more than he should have done.” Again, in late September 2008, the police stated that “it was decided that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegation of trafficking and thus further investigation was not warranted.”In December 2008, C.N. was assessed by the Poppy Project, a Government funded project providing housing and support for victims of trafficking, who concluded that she had been subjected to five of the six indicators of forced labour, as identified by the ILO. In particular, her movement had been restricted to the workplace, her wages were withheld to pay a debt she did not know about, her salary was withheld for four years, her passport was retained, and she was subjected to threats of denunciation to the authorities.In February 2009, the Police noted that there “was no evidence that would support exploitation of any kind”, as defined in Section 4 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004 on trafficking. Later, in March 2009, the police recorded that “there was no evidence to show that this female was a victim of slavery or forced labour.” Finally, in August 2009 the police wrote to the applicant’s solicitor, indicating that her case did not appear to constitute an offence of trafficking for the purpose of exploitation, and that they were not aware of any specific offence of forced labour or servitude in English criminal law which would apply to the facts of the case.Section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, which received Royal Assent in November 2009, made slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour criminal offences punishable by a fine and/up to fourteen years imprisonment, however, it came into force in April 2010 and did not have retrospective effect.",trafficking in persons,0
"Rong Chen was a manager of at least five brothels in Northern Ireland, three in Belfast, one in Londonderry and one in Newry. In each of the brothels, she provided brothel housekeepers who would receive instructions from her as to the appointments and receive payments from clients. Rong Chen visited the premises, collected money, maintained the properties and provided food for the women working in each brothel. The money generated over the period January 2008 to May 2009 reached about ₤280,000.The customers were sought through newspaper advertisements and the prostitutes rotated between the various premises. It has not been possible to identify any of the prostitutes who worked in these brothels except for two Chinese nationals, D. and M.The Court noted that Rong Chen had coerced four Chinese women who worked in these brothels – two as prostitutes (D. and M.) and two as brothel housekeepers (H. and T.). All of them had come to the United Kingdom either on visas which had expired or were illegal immigrants on arrival. Coercion was to be seen in the context that there was no evidence that any of them had been involved in prostitution prior to coming to Northern Ireland. The victims’ testimonies showed that the victims were isolated, frightened, exploited and threatened by various statements from Rong Chen (e.g. that her boyfriend was a member of a Triad gang, that her sister’s brother was a high ranking police officer or that they would be detained because of their illegal status). Further, the conditions inside the brothels were squalid.Simon Dempsey was accused of assisting Rong Chen in renting properties for the purpose of prostitution, driving Rong Chen around Northern Ireland in connection with her activities of controlling prostitution, identifying rival brothels, driving prostitutes between brothels, collecting money from the brothels and dealing with criminal property by banking some of the proceeds.Jason Owen Hinton was accused of assisting Rong Chen in arranging a large number of flights to Northern   Ireland, in the knowledge that she was making those journeys for the purpose of controlling prostitution and taking part in a campaign of the attempted disruption of rival premises.",trafficking in persons,1
"On three occasions, the defendant arranged for A. to enter the Republic of Ireland through Dublin Airport, for her to work as a prostitute in Belfast. These were in December 2010, January 2011 and March 2011. On the third occasion, the defendant also made arrangements for B., who knew A., to come to Belfast through Dublin Airport to work as a prostitute. A. and B. said that they had asked the defendant to book their air tickets, and that the defendant had provided them with an apartment in Belfast. The victims paid him rent for the apartment in Belfast, and paid back their travelling expenses. On the third occasion, the defendant drove A. and B. to Belfast in his car and they gave him money for petrol. The agreed facts do not indicate whether he received any further financial recompense for his involvement.",trafficking in persons,1
"R v. N.N. had left Vietnam and travelled via the Czech Republic to the United Kingdom. He said that he had been recruited by a Vietnamese man Ha soon after his arrival in the United   Kingdom. Ha offered N. a job and transported him to the factory.N. said that he had become frightened when he found out that he had been dealing with illegal plants and wished to leave. He ate, slept and worked in the factory, and he was unpaid. He therefore called Ha that he did not wish to work in the factory anymore. He was threatened that if he or any of the other factory workers stopped working they might be killed. As he took the threat seriously, N. returned to the factory and continued to work as a gardener. The appellant and his co-accused were all arrested and sentenced to a detention and training order for 18 months. During a hearing in 2009, N. said that his date of birth was April 1992. This meant that he was a child at the time of arrest. It also appeared that N. had been smuggled into the United Kingdom on the basis that his parents had funded his journey to what was hoped would be a life with better prospects. On 21 April 2009 police officers attended factory premises in London following reports of a suspected burglary. They discovered a cannabis factory, together with all the necessary paraphernalia for the successful and profitable cultivation of cannabis. The police were informed that a large body of men had been seen in the gardens to the rear of residential premises, forcing their way into the cannabis factory premises, presumably to take over the factory, or to discourage those within the factory from continuing the cultivation of cannabis.R v Vinh Cong LeIn January 2010, following his guilty plea to one count of producing cannabis, the appellant was sentenced to 20 months detention.The appellant was one of a substantial group of defendants charged with offences arising from the production of cannabis in Milton Road, Cambridge. The address in Milton Road was a 4 bed roomed house which had been converted into a cannabis factory. By contrast with the accommodation in N., the house had not been converted or secured in any way that would have prevented the appellant from leaving it. When interviewed, the appellant said he was 15 years old. He gave a prepared statement to the effect that he had been smuggled into the United Kingdom by his adoptive father. He wandered the streets before encountering two Vietnamese nationals who said they would help him find his adoptive father. They took him to their address. He realized that cannabis plants were being grown, but did not realize that the growing of cannabis was illegal.The appeals arose not from the crime of trafficking in human beings, but rather the conviction and sentencing of two defendants who themselves may have been (and it was contended, were) the victims of trafficking and consequent exploitation, who pleaded guilty to offences involving the production of cannabis. The appellants were sentenced on separate occasions in September 2009 and January 2010.",trafficking in persons,1
"Since 2018, the investigation led by the UK border police identified a network of alien immigration which was led by Iraqis who were transporting immigrants to various regions of France and then transporting them to Great Britain. These migrants were often hidden in trucks. This network appeals to numerous smugglers who take in charge of the migrants, against remuneration, their transportion and their dissimulation in these vehicles mainly on highway rest areas. The substantial income brought by this activity to the network is estimated to be several dozens of millions Euro. An organisation of logistics particularly elaborated has been brought into light during the surveillances, using several vehicles, to numerous smugglers using discrete ways of communication and to illegal money laundering financial schemes. Hashem Saleh BAZLAH appears to have a central role as well on the national territory as in other European countries. The offenses continued from August 1, 2018 to January 21, 2020 in Le Mans, in Chatellerault, on the French national territory as well as within the European Union.

"The defendants used the dark website AlphaBay to sell Carfentanyl and Fentanyl to customers from around the world. They exported or supplied a total of 2853 packages to 443 customers, who were mainly located in the UK, the US, Europe and Canada, for the equivalent of GBP 163,474 in crypto currencies.Carfentanyl and Fentanyl are synthetic opioids. Carfentanyl is 5,000 times stronger than heroin. Fentanyl is 30 to 50 times stronger than heroin. The drugs can be absorbed through the skin, so contact with a small amount can already be fatal. Before consumption, they have to be diluted heavily with mixing agents such as paracetamol, caffeine and sugars such as mannitol. Once diluted, they are consumed like heroin (by smoking or injection) and will have similar effects.The defendants purchased equipment (including 100% Isopropyl Alcohol, a vacuum sealer, etc.) and rented premises where they mixed and packaged the drugs before posting the drugs to customers.On the 20th of February 2016, Mandy Lowther was taken to a hospital in Leeds with hypoxic brain injury and aspiration pneumonia, symptoms which are consistent with exposure to Carfentanyl or Fentanyl.Law enforcement gathered numerous pieces of evidence during the period from 1 December 2016 to 30 April 2017 tying the defendants to the drug production and the premises, including inter alia electricity bills, equipment purchases, and video footage from post offices.On 24 April 2017, the defendants were seen entering the premises and were arrested. The defendants were in possession of 2.6kg of Carfentanyl, 0.226kg of Fentanyl and 46kg of mixing agents. Messages found on Jake Levene and Mandy Lowther’s mobile phones proved it was their enterprise and that Lee Childs worked for them.When searching the premises, law enforcement further found fingerprints of the defendants on various items and their DNA profiles matched a number of equipment used to dilute the substances. Furthermore, Jake Levene’s laptop was found logged onto the AlphaBay Market on the TOR Browser as UKBargins.AlphaBay was a website on the dark web used as marketplace for controlled substances. The users could register without having to specify personal details. The seller advertised the drugs for sale and the buyer provided an address for shipment. Both parties created digital currency wallets on the website to hold and transfer cryptocurrencies. Once the shipment arrived, the buyer indicated it on the website and AlphaBay released the payment to the seller minus a commission. The data was encrypted in order to protect the users’ identities. Sellers’ reputations were established by feedback and reviews.According to the website, UKBarings had bought six items for a total of GBP 5,154.64 and sold 2853 items for a total of GBP 163,474. Open windows further showed sales of the substances being processed on the website with postage by UK Royal Mail and waiting orders. Documents with names and addresses of customers as well as a spreadsheet of prices was, likewise, found. Additionally, four digital currency wallets were found on the laptop, containing different cryptocurrencies equivalent to a total of GBP 4,819. Regarding one of the wallets, the transaction history showed that there had been regular transactions between 26 December 2016 and 10 April 2017 and that the equivalent of GBP 49,600 was withdrawn from the account on 26 April 2017.All three defendants were charged with two counts of conspiracy to evade prohibition on exportation of controlled drug of class A and two counts of conspiracy to supply Class A drug.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"In this Appeals case in front of the Royal Court of Justice, D seeks leave to appeal against her sentence and conviction, and Maione seeks to appeal against her conviction. Both Applicants claimed to have been victims of human trafficking and sought to rely on the statutory defence afforded to victims of human trafficking under the Modern Slavery Act (2015) Section 45. The Appeals Court, in this case, deals with the common issue raised by the two unrelated appeals as to whether the legal or persuasive burden of proof to establish every element to the defence rests on the defendant or whether it is the prosecution’s responsibility to disprove one or more elements of the defence to the criminal standard. The UK Government, as the Appellant, submits that the defendant is best placed to identify his/her situation and provide evidence for fulfilling the elements of the defence than the prosecution. The Respondent, the Government of the United Kingdom “Regina”, submits that the prosecution is in a far better position to establish the facts than the defendant.The Court’s reasoning especially considers the situation of a child victim, concluding that the practical difficulties involved in proving elements such as age would impede the  protective aims of the Act. Additionally, the Court considers that frequently victims use the defence of duress and the defence provided under Section 45 of the Modern Slavery Act in parallel. The Court notes that the Section 45 defence bears a close resemblance to that of the duress defence. The Court establishes that it would be impractical for the jury to assess both defences based on the same facts while applying different tests. In defence of duress, the burden of proof rests on the prosecution. Conclusively, the Court establishes that in line with Article 4 ECHR and the Directive 2011/36 EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and its victims, which underpin the Modern Slavery Act, the burden on proof falls on the prosecution. Based on this reasoning, the Appeals Court concludes that a reverse burden of proof would undermine the protection that Section 45 is designed to afford to vulnerable victims of human trafficking.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"From 1987 to 2001, Messrs Arnold Maurice Bengis, Jeffrey Noll, and David Bengis, through their company, Hout Bay Fishing Industries Ltd., harvested large quantities of rock lobsters from South African waters, in amounts that exceeded authorized quotas, for export to the United States. They underreported the fish harvested to South African authorities and bribed South African fisheries inspectors to help them carry out and conceal their illegal overharvesting scheme. As part of the operation, the individuals arranged for disadvantaged South African citizens, who did not have valid U.S. working permits, to work for low wages at their fish processing facility in Portland, Maine, where the employees were required to process, among other things, illegally harvested South African rock lobster. In May 2001, South Africa authorities seized a container of unlawfully harvested lobsters. As part of the criminal prosecution in South Africa, Hout Bay were made to pay South Africa USD 7 million for its illegal conduct.In 2003, the Defendants were charged in the United States with importing, among other things, illegally-harvested South African South Coast and West Coast rock lobster into the U.S. In July 2004, Arnold Maurice Bengis was sentenced to 46 months imprisonment, Jeffrey Noll was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment and David Bengis was sentenced to 1 year imprisonment. As part of their sentences, Arnold Bengis and Mr Noll forfeited USD 5.9 million to the United States Government. After applications by the South African Government and numerous proceedings, the District Court for the Southern District of New York, on 14 June 2013, ordered that the Defendants pay a combined total restitution in the amount USD 22 million to South Africa. Mr David Bengis, however, did not pay in accordance with the restitution order. As a result, the District Court, on 6 March, 2017, held that Mr David Bengis was in default in paying the restitution order and ordered that he be resentenced. The Court increased the sentence of imprisonment on Mr Bengis to one of 57 months and made an additional forfeiture order of USD 37 million.A letter of request from the US authorities dated 21 July, 2017, was sent to the Attorney General of Jersey seeking a saisie judiciaire, in respect of the realisable property of Mr Bengis, to assist in enforcing this Forfeiture Order. It was pursuant to that letter of request that the Attorney General applied for and was granted the saisie on 28 July 2017.The latest proceeding in Jersey, on 23 March 2018, was an application to lift the saisie judiciaire issued in respect of the realisable property of Mr Bengis.

"The case involves members of an underground community of internet users that produced and distributed illicit pirated copies of recently released movies in violation of property rights. The defendants were identified by the Federation Against Copyright Theft (“FACT”), an association of studios, etc, during an investigation that included web monitoring in 2012. Each of the defendants, including Sahil Rafiq and Reece Daniel Baker, played a different role in the conspiracy, but each accepted that their illicit activities resulted in a loss of at least GBP 1 million to property right holders.Rafiq was involved from July 2010 until February 2013. After having previously run the release group “DTRG,” he started running another one under the name “26K” by 2012. After being identified by FACT, he accepted that he was responsible for all of the activities of the group since he was its leader. While the exact number of pirated motion pictures is not known, the review of just four torrent sites revealed that 26K had released 885 films, of which over half were copied from DVDs and Blu-rays. Evidence suggests that Rafiq had been editing copies himself in order to prepare them for release and that he had been working together with his co-defendants, especially with Baker who had, inter alia, provided him with audio.Baker also started as member of the DTRG release group in October 2011. He left the group to form his own under the name “Goon,” which he operated until he subsequently took control of another group “Hope” or later named “Resistance.” His groups specialised in releasing copies that had previously been recorded in the cinema by so-called “cammers.” His group paid cammers to obtain the first copies of various films, including “Skyfall” and “Argo” which had been recorded abroad and for which the group paid USD 100. The review of four torrent sites suggests that he had been involved in the release of 310 movies, over half of which were recorded in the cinema. He sometimes worked together with three of his co-defendants.The defendants Rafiq and Baker were both arrested and searched by law enforcement authorities on 1 February 2013. After being interviewed, Baker was released on bail. He then bought new equipment under his girlfriend’s name, as his had been seized by the authorities, and re-offended. In July 2013, FACT identified his recent activities, and the police searched his home again and re-arrested the defendant.Rafiq and Baker, together with three co-defendants who had lesser roles, were tried for conspiracy to defraud. The were all sentenced in the Crown Court at Wolverhampton on 17 December 2015. Rafiq and Baker were sentenced to four years and six months' and four years and two months' imprisonment respectively. Graeme Reid and Ben Cooper were each sentenced to three years and six months’, and Scott Hemming to two years’ imprisonment.

"This case involves offences related to the setting up and operation of websites which facilitated the viewing of mostly recently released filmed in breach of copyright and the advertising revenue acquired from this illicit activity. From April 2008 to April 2013, the defendant, Paul Mahoney, created and operated a series of websites which enabled internet users to view films and TV series. The users just had to log onto the sites, which allowed them to stream the particular motion picture or TV episode free of charge recently after or before they had been released.The defendant created websites known as Bedroommedia, and later Fastpasstv, on which links to 12,139 films were available at one time. The links were acquired in one of three ways:1. Users had developed and submitted the links, which were later approved by the defendant or his staff. 2. The defendant developed a Scrapper software that searched other sites for films and TV shows and automatically recorded the links to them. 3. The defendant developed a software to search other sites, in particular Usenet, a site where promotional copies of movies were made available, for unreleased films. The films were subsequently downloaded to the website “Wootly,” a free video hosting service. The defendant was then able to add links to Wootly to his own website.The majority of the material was, therefore, not hosted on his own sites but rather by third party sites that were often placed abroad in order to avoid legal action against them. The defendant did not act alone but employed staff and paid them for their services. The staff help him maintain, develop, and improve the websites. He also had other employees acting as moderators or administrators, assisting him with running the websites.According to chat messages between the defendant and his employees, the websites were making more than GBP 1,000 per day from advertising. Likewise, from mid-2010 until February 2011, the defendant’s site had been viewed on over one million occasions.In 2007, the Federation Against Copyright Theft (“FACT”), the trade association of the film industry, took note of the defendant’s website and serve a Cease-and-Desist notice on 10 August 2008. The notice was ignored, and the defendant redirected the users to a new website. On 25 March 2011, law enforcement searched his residence, seized several items and arrested the defendant. After being released on bail, the defendant re-offended and was re-arrested on 19 December 2011. The website was shutdown on 2 April 2013, which is when the defendant stopped receiving advertising revenue from the site.Mahoney was ultimately sentenced to a four year Determinate Custodial Sentence, comprising two years custody and two years on licence, for conspiracy to defraud as well as acquiring and concealing criminal property on 8 September 2015. He later unsuccessfully appealed against his sentence.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The decision regards the appeal against the decision of a District Judge made at Westminster Magistrates' Court, ordering the appellant’s extradition to France. The appellant was the subject of a conviction European Arrest Warrant (EAW), issued by the Regional Court of Lille (France) for (i) participation in a criminal organisation, and (ii) facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence. He was alleged to have been the principal of an organised network of smuggling of migrants to Great Britain, which he directed by telephone from the United Kingdom.On 5 and 6 December 2011, he was convicted in his absence by the Criminal Court of Lille and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, all of which remain to be served. He is entitled to a re-trial on his return to France.The EAW was issued on 20 March 2013 and certified by the National Crime Agency on 28 October 2013. He was arrested on 8 July 2014. The appellant was born in Kurdistan. He escaped persecution in Iraq by being smuggled into the United Kingdom, where he arrived in 1999. He allegedly suffered considerable mis-treatment including physical and sexual abuse while staying in State institutions. At a certain stage, he escape and ended up in France where he engaged in activities aimed at facilitating the illegal entry of migrants in the country. He was convicted twice in France for migrant smuggling and served custodial sentences. He later returned to the United Kingdom. He is currently married, with children, and works in a car wash. He was paid very little but his income made a significant difference to the family’s budget. The appellant has learning difficulties and a story of depression and health issues. He had already tried to commit suicide. In ascertaining the facts, the Court relied on the testimony of the appellant and his wife as well as expert evidence (regarding the appellant’s mental health). The representative of France was also heard and provided evidence, notably in regard of France’s capacity to set up preventive measures to protect the appellant from suicide Legal findings: The District Judge Westminster Magistrates' Court determined the execution of the EAW and the surrender of the appellant to France. The High Court of Justice dismissed the appeal. For further details see “Other background” under “Persons Accused” and “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"This case relates to three cases listed together. All appellants claimed to be victims of trafficking (VOT) and thus argued that they should not be punished for the alleged crimes in accordance with section 45 of the national Modern Slavery Act 2015. AAI, originally from Sierra Leone, is a victim of the Sierra Leonean civil war. He and his parents were abducted by the Revolutionary United Front (“RUF”). He stated that he was raped and seriously assaulted by various men. His parents were murdered. He had been trafficked as a child soldier. After he eventually escaped, he met T in Freetown where he worked for him. He washed his feet and worked for him at the beach. In return, T promised to help him with accommodation and education. This was, however, never fulfilled. AAI claimed that T, who he feared, organised his journey to the UK via Gambia in a lorry, in return AAI would have had to send him money from Europe. AAI claimed to be under T’s psychological control. AAI arrived in the United Kingdom (UK) on 20 May 2003. His asylum claim was refused on 17 July 2003 and his asylum appeal dismissed on 17 December 2003. Since for his removal from the UK a valid Emergency Travel Document (ETD) was necessary, he had to attend an interview at the Sierra Leonean High Commission. There, he did not answer questions by stammering and shaking, and he indicated that he was not a Sierra Leonean national. Moreover, he stated that he feared for his safety in Sierra Leone. Following this, the Secretary of State for the Home Department issued a notice under section 35 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 2004 requiring him to attend the interview and fully cooperate. He did not comply with the notice. AAI was thus convicted of failing to take actions as required by the Secretary of State, and he was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment. On 18 April 2013, he made an additional claim for asylum and an application to revoke the deportation order which was rejected; he thus appealed. Eventually, in December 2016, he was referred to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) and on 22 February 2017, the Single Competent Authority (SCA) made a positive reasonable grounds decision that the appellant is a VOT, followed by a positive conclusive grounds decision on 11 January 2019. AAH, a Nigerian national from the Yoruba tribe, escaped from a proposed marriage arranged by her father. She left Nigeria in August 2007 with the help of an agent and made the arrangement that she would reimburse him for the ticket by working. However, she escaped the house to where she had been taken. In 2009, the man contacted her and threatened her by indicating that he wanted his money returned. Following this, AAH was introduced to another man who groomed her for the purpose of sexual exploitation. After finding her a job in a care home, he took her wages. On 28 May 2015 she attended an interview for a job as a care worker with Care Management Group Ltd. She presented a French ID card and passport which were not her own, and she was subsequently offered the job. Following an enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service by the company after seven months, it became apparent that the documents were false. She thus was arrested at her workplace on 15 February 2016. On arrest, she provided the police with her address, where her genuine Nigerian passport confirming her true identity was found. On 15 March 2016, she pleaded guilty to a single count of possession of an identity document with improper intention, to make a gain for herself or another and was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment. Dated 20 July 2017, the SCA took a positive conclusive grounds determination as to AAH being a VOT. AAD, originally from Vietnam, suffered from ill-treatment and abuse during his childhood and employment. After he had left Vietnam in 2002 due to persecution by authorities, he lived in Laos until 2016. Since he was offered the opportunity to leave Laos with the prospect of a better life and employment, he paid $16,000 for being relocated to Germany. With the help of his family who obtained the remaining money from a “loan shark”. He flew from Laos to Hong Kong, and then to Russia. He had to pay an additional $9000 for his transportation to the United Kingdom, where he arrived in November 2016. On arrival, he was beaten up and told he owed an additional $700 which his family were required to raise. He was taken to London, given a mobile telephone and consequently abandoned by his traffickers. Through one of his acquaintances, he found work at several restaurants for approximately 7 months. After his work ended, a man called A Tu found him work at a construction site in Liverpool where he only stayed for a short period of time. He was then placed to an address in Stoke on Trent, where AAD believed he was offered cleaning work. However, he was instructed to tend and cultivate cannabis plants. On 4 October 2017, the appellant was arrested after he was seen approaching and entering the property where 353 cannabis plants were cultivated. On 15 February 2018, the appellant pleaded guilty to producing a controlled drug of class B contrary to section 4(2)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment. AAD claimed asylum on 8 March 2018 and requested a reference to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) as a victim of trafficking on 4 June 2018 which ultimately resulted in a conclusive grounds decision on 1 February 2019.",drug offences,0
"The defendants used the dark website AlphaBay to sell Carfentanyl and Fentanyl to customers from around the world. They exported or supplied a total of 2853 packages to 443 customers, who were mainly located in the UK, the US, Europe and Canada, for the equivalent of GBP 163,474 in crypto currencies.Carfentanyl and Fentanyl are synthetic opioids. Carfentanyl is 5,000 times stronger than heroin. Fentanyl is 30 to 50 times stronger than heroin. The drugs can be absorbed through the skin, so contact with a small amount can already be fatal. Before consumption, they have to be diluted heavily with mixing agents such as paracetamol, caffeine and sugars such as mannitol. Once diluted, they are consumed like heroin (by smoking or injection) and will have similar effects.The defendants purchased equipment (including 100% Isopropyl Alcohol, a vacuum sealer, etc.) and rented premises where they mixed and packaged the drugs before posting the drugs to customers.On the 20th of February 2016, Mandy Lowther was taken to a hospital in Leeds with hypoxic brain injury and aspiration pneumonia, symptoms which are consistent with exposure to Carfentanyl or Fentanyl.Law enforcement gathered numerous pieces of evidence during the period from 1 December 2016 to 30 April 2017 tying the defendants to the drug production and the premises, including inter alia electricity bills, equipment purchases, and video footage from post offices.On 24 April 2017, the defendants were seen entering the premises and were arrested. The defendants were in possession of 2.6kg of Carfentanyl, 0.226kg of Fentanyl and 46kg of mixing agents. Messages found on Jake Levene and Mandy Lowther’s mobile phones proved it was their enterprise and that Lee Childs worked for them.When searching the premises, law enforcement further found fingerprints of the defendants on various items and their DNA profiles matched a number of equipment used to dilute the substances. Furthermore, Jake Levene’s laptop was found logged onto the AlphaBay Market on the TOR Browser as UKBargins.AlphaBay was a website on the dark web used as marketplace for controlled substances. The users could register without having to specify personal details. The seller advertised the drugs for sale and the buyer provided an address for shipment. Both parties created digital currency wallets on the website to hold and transfer cryptocurrencies. Once the shipment arrived, the buyer indicated it on the website and AlphaBay released the payment to the seller minus a commission. The data was encrypted in order to protect the users’ identities. Sellers’ reputations were established by feedback and reviews.According to the website, UKBarings had bought six items for a total of GBP 5,154.64 and sold 2853 items for a total of GBP 163,474. Open windows further showed sales of the substances being processed on the website with postage by UK Royal Mail and waiting orders. Documents with names and addresses of customers as well as a spreadsheet of prices was, likewise, found. Additionally, four digital currency wallets were found on the laptop, containing different cryptocurrencies equivalent to a total of GBP 4,819. Regarding one of the wallets, the transaction history showed that there had been regular transactions between 26 December 2016 and 10 April 2017 and that the equivalent of GBP 49,600 was withdrawn from the account on 26 April 2017.All three defendants were charged with two counts of conspiracy to evade prohibition on exportation of controlled drug of class A and two counts of conspiracy to supply Class A drug.",drug offences,1
"In this Appeals case in front of the Royal Court of Justice, D seeks leave to appeal against her sentence and conviction, and Maione seeks to appeal against her conviction. Both Applicants claimed to have been victims of human trafficking and sought to rely on the statutory defence afforded to victims of human trafficking under the Modern Slavery Act (2015) Section 45. The Appeals Court, in this case, deals with the common issue raised by the two unrelated appeals as to whether the legal or persuasive burden of proof to establish every element to the defence rests on the defendant or whether it is the prosecution’s responsibility to disprove one or more elements of the defence to the criminal standard. The UK Government, as the Appellant, submits that the defendant is best placed to identify his/her situation and provide evidence for fulfilling the elements of the defence than the prosecution. The Respondent, the Government of the United Kingdom “Regina”, submits that the prosecution is in a far better position to establish the facts than the defendant.The Court’s reasoning especially considers the situation of a child victim, concluding that the practical difficulties involved in proving elements such as age would impede the  protective aims of the Act. Additionally, the Court considers that frequently victims use the defence of duress and the defence provided under Section 45 of the Modern Slavery Act in parallel. The Court notes that the Section 45 defence bears a close resemblance to that of the duress defence. The Court establishes that it would be impractical for the jury to assess both defences based on the same facts while applying different tests. In defence of duress, the burden of proof rests on the prosecution. Conclusively, the Court establishes that in line with Article 4 ECHR and the Directive 2011/36 EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and its victims, which underpin the Modern Slavery Act, the burden on proof falls on the prosecution. Based on this reasoning, the Appeals Court concludes that a reverse burden of proof would undermine the protection that Section 45 is designed to afford to vulnerable victims of human trafficking.",drug offences,1
"This case concerns criminal appeals against four separate criminal convictions of four people, who were forced into criminality as a result of being trafficked.R v. T.H.N.In September 2011, T.H.N. was found in a house in Bristol in which a very large quantity of cannabis was being cultivated. The interviews revealed that he may have been brought into England in a freezer container in 2010 (although he had previously been removed from the UK in 2009 after making two attempts to enter illegally). T.H.N. alleged that he was the trafficking victim, however, UKBA gave a negative decision at the reasonable grounds stage (see the commentary section for more details). T.H.N. pleaded guilty to producing a controlled drug in the Bristol Crown Court in 2012. He was sentenced to a detention and training order for 12 months. While in custody, the appellant met the Children's Commissioner. A further referral was made to the competent authority which this time made a positive reasonable grounds decision. T.H.N. was released from the sentence and put into the care of the local authority. However, a few days later T.H.N. went missing and it was believed that he had been re-trafficked. By then, T.H.N. had waived privilege and instructions had been taken from him, and the appeal to the Court of Appeal was pursued in his absence on the basis of those instructions.The prosecution first challenged T.H.N.'s appeal application by noting that a number of features of the case pointed away from the conclusion that he had been the trafficking victim. However, having considered a new report on errors made by the competent authority, the prosecution reconsidered its position and stated that had the evidence which was now available been available at the time of the original judgment, there would have been no prosecution.  The Court of Appeal agreed that there was powerful evidence that T.H.N. was a trafficked child and that his criminal activities were integral to the circumstances in which he was a victim. The Court quashed the conviction, stating that if the appellant had been prosecuted, an abuse of process argument would have been likely to succeed.R v. T.In 2009, T. was arrested in a house where a sophisticated cannabis growing operation was discovered. T. denied that he was tending the plants, and asserted that he was just looking after the house while the owner went to a party. The Crown Court considered T.'s age and concluded that he was an adult aged between 18 and 21 years. The later found birth certificate indicated that T. may have been less than 18. However, later at a retrial at the Crown Court, it was concluded that T. was at least 18 years old. T. was convicted and sentenced to two years detention in a Young Offenders' Institution for the offence of cultivating cannabis.The Court of Appeal noted that until after conviction of T., no proper consideration was given to the question whether T. had been the trafficking victim. In 2012, the competent authority concluded that T. had been a child victim of trafficking. It was said that T.'s presence as a gardener in the cannabis factory formed part of the process in which he was victimised. Further, the Court stated that a series of inconsistencies in the explanations provided by T. at different stages could not be determinative of T.'s age, nor indeed whether he was the trafficking victim.On the basis of the evidence, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal.R v. H.V.N.In May 2012, police officers attended a house in Mansfield after having been alerted by local residents who had seen H.V.N. being removed from the house with his hands bound by a group of men. The police found H.V.N. nearby, barefoot and frightened. Inside the house a large quantity of cannabis was being grown as a professional operation. H.V.N. was arrested and admitted that he had been in the premises and was looking after the crop. He knew it was cannabis but initially did not know it was illegal.An age assessment concluded that H.V.N. was just under 17 years old. At first, it was not considered whether H.V.N. may have been the trafficking victim. The competent authority later decided that H.V.N. may have been the trafficking victim, however, this positive reasonable grounds decision was for some reason not presented at the Court. H.V.N. pleaded guilty to producing cannabis and was sentenced to eight months of defention. The Court of Appeal noted that the guilty plea was tendered in ignorance of the important fact that the positive reasonable ground decision was made before H.V.N. pleaded guilty. The Court also noted that if the Crown Court had been fully informed on the facts now available, the case would have been stopped as an abuse of process. The appeal against conviction was allowed.R v. L.This case concerned a Ugandan woman around 30 years old. In early 2011, the authorities concluded that L.'s Portuguese passport was forged and L. was arrested while applying for a national insurance number.In an interview, L. said that she had been in the UK for seven years and came from Uganda. She was born in Portugal and had travelled to the UK on the promise of finding work as a child minder, using a false passport from Uganda. She said that she had been held captive in England and forced into prostitution for several years. When she had been released by her trafficker, she had been given a Portuguese passport which she believed was genuine.L. was advised by her solicitor to plead guilty to the charge she faced to avoid more serious sentence if the police concluded that her account was false. Following her guilty plead, L. was sentenced to six months imprisonment for possession of a false identity. While in custody, the Poppy Project began a detailed investigation of the case. It argued that there was powerful evidence that L. was the trafficking victim. This opinion was also supported by the competent UKBA authority.The Court of Appeal decided that given L.'s prolonged exposure to involuntary prostitution and forced control, the offence she had actually committed has arisen as a result of her being the trafficking victim. The Court also concluded that it appeared that L. truly believed that a forged passport was genuine, and the use of it represented a step in a process by which she would escape her situation.The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal.",drug offences,0
"R v. N.N. had left Vietnam and travelled via the Czech Republic to the United Kingdom. He said that he had been recruited by a Vietnamese man Ha soon after his arrival in the United   Kingdom. Ha offered N. a job and transported him to the factory.N. said that he had become frightened when he found out that he had been dealing with illegal plants and wished to leave. He ate, slept and worked in the factory, and he was unpaid. He therefore called Ha that he did not wish to work in the factory anymore. He was threatened that if he or any of the other factory workers stopped working they might be killed. As he took the threat seriously, N. returned to the factory and continued to work as a gardener. The appellant and his co-accused were all arrested and sentenced to a detention and training order for 18 months. During a hearing in 2009, N. said that his date of birth was April 1992. This meant that he was a child at the time of arrest. It also appeared that N. had been smuggled into the United Kingdom on the basis that his parents had funded his journey to what was hoped would be a life with better prospects. On 21 April 2009 police officers attended factory premises in London following reports of a suspected burglary. They discovered a cannabis factory, together with all the necessary paraphernalia for the successful and profitable cultivation of cannabis. The police were informed that a large body of men had been seen in the gardens to the rear of residential premises, forcing their way into the cannabis factory premises, presumably to take over the factory, or to discourage those within the factory from continuing the cultivation of cannabis.R v Vinh Cong LeIn January 2010, following his guilty plea to one count of producing cannabis, the appellant was sentenced to 20 months detention.The appellant was one of a substantial group of defendants charged with offences arising from the production of cannabis in Milton Road, Cambridge. The address in Milton Road was a 4 bed roomed house which had been converted into a cannabis factory. By contrast with the accommodation in N., the house had not been converted or secured in any way that would have prevented the appellant from leaving it. When interviewed, the appellant said he was 15 years old. He gave a prepared statement to the effect that he had been smuggled into the United Kingdom by his adoptive father. He wandered the streets before encountering two Vietnamese nationals who said they would help him find his adoptive father. They took him to their address. He realized that cannabis plants were being grown, but did not realize that the growing of cannabis was illegal.The appeals arose not from the crime of trafficking in human beings, but rather the conviction and sentencing of two defendants who themselves may have been (and it was contended, were) the victims of trafficking and consequent exploitation, who pleaded guilty to offences involving the production of cannabis. The appellants were sentenced on separate occasions in September 2009 and January 2010.",drug offences,1
"On 29th July 2009, Light aircraft G-CCLV arrived at Mona Airfield Anglesey from Le Touquet, Northern France. On board were 3 men. David Lloyd was the pilot and Paul Roche and Matthew Lockwood were passengers. North Wales Police were waiting for the aircraft as they had become suspicious following an earlier problem with flight plans. When the aircraft had landed the Police officers approached it. Matthew Lockwood ran off but was caught shortly after.The Police then searched the plane.They found 14kg of cocaine in a pilot’s bag and loose in the back of the plane.The Police then asked UKBA for assistance and the Manchester C & F I Team attended and took control of the investigation All 3 men were charged with the importation of Cocaine with a street value of £3.5 million.Lockwood had a mobile phone on his person. Text messages from this phone showed that Lockwood had been directed by someone in the UK to collect the drugs from a 3rd party in France at the Bristol Hotel in Le Touquet, France. An additional four mobile phones were uplifted form the search of Lockwood’s house in Prestwich, Manchester.Billing from Lockwood’s phone was obtained which revealed the extent of the conspiracy. From cell siting of suspects phones it was clear that an Organised Crime Group from Manchester was behind the importation.In September 2009, the owner of the plane, David Watson, attended Manchester Airport voluntarily and was interviewed under caution by Officers of UKBA. Watson owns a public house in the Prestwich, Greater Manchester. Watson admitted that he was in the USA at the time of the importation and denied any knowledge or involvement in the events of the 29th July 2009.Analysis of David Watson’s phone billing showed that he was in contact with a telephone number that was also recovered from a phone uplifted from the house search of Lockwood. It was clear that both Lockwood and David Watson were very close to this person. Expert analysis by a cell site expert showed that this person was the same person that had been directing Lockwood in France.On the 3rd December 2009 David Watson was arrested at The Plough Public house in Prestwich Greater Manchester. He was again interviewed under caution by Officers of UKBA and later charged on the 17th December 2009.In the Spring of 2010, UKBA investigators identified the person that Lockwood and David Watson had in common as being Andrew Watson, David’s son.Intelligence suggested that Andrew Watson had fled the UK. UKBA C&FI applied for and obtained a European Arrest Warrant which was issued by Liverpool Magistrates court in May 2010.On the 31st May 2010, Richard McArthur was arrested by UKBA at Coquelles in Mercedes CX02 GVR. Within a concealment in the fuel tank was 15kg of cannabis. UKBA C&FI Dover adopted this investigation. McArthur asked that his girlfriend, who he lived with in Belfast, be notified of his arrest.A search of McArthur’s home address revealed paperwork in the name of Michael Cahillane. Cahillane had been released from prison on 1st December 2008 for smuggling over 60kg of cannabis into Northern Ireland. Cahillane lived in Stockport, Greater Manchester.Manchester CFI Officers began investigating Cahillane and McArthur and it became clear that they were the transport who had arranged for the cocaine to be delivered to Lockwood at the Bristol Hotel in Le-Touquet.McArthur stayed at a Key Camp site St. Valerie whilst he waited for the light aircraft to arrive.On the 5th August 2010, Cahillane and McArthur were arrested, interviewed and charged. Items uplifted from a search of their premises suggested their involvement in the conspiracy. A mobile phone uplifted from Cahillane’s home address revealed the extent of the conspiracy.Cahillane had acted as a broker between the Watson’s and an unknown “Mr Big” in Spain.Cahillane sourced the cocaine from this person and agreed to transport it to Le Touquet, where it would be met by members of the Watson’s OCG and flown back to the UK in David Watson’s plane.Cahillane arranged for the money from the Watson OCG, that was to be used to pay for the Cocaine, to be stored at an associates address.On the 14th March 2011, Andrew Watson was arrested in Malaga, Spain with a notorious Manchester criminal, Stephen Devalda. Devalda was wanted for an armed robbery in Lancashire in 2005. With assistance from our partners at SOCA Watson was extradited to the UK.",drug offences,0
"During 2004/2005 the United Kingdom experienced a massive increase in the availability of Class A Drugs (primarily cocaine) at street level. This increase however, was proportionally inverse to the purity of the drugs and forensic examination identified that the drugs had been cut with pharmaceutical chemicals primarily but not exclusively Benzocaine and Lidocaine.Benzocaine and Lidocaine have a number of legitimate uses in the human and animal medicine field and some minor applications in the manufacturing of plastics.The use of the two substances was viewed as a new trend and the benefits of there use was explained by a number of experts. The chemicals in question are both mild anaesthetics and when mixed with the controlled drugs gave a similar numbing effect. In addition, the substances were both members of the “caine” chemical family and would mimic each other when subjected to the process of preparing crack cocaine from cocaine. This process requires the drug to be heated, burning off the impurities and making the substance more potent. If a drug dealer were to buy a kilo of cocaine cut for example with fifty percent glucose then the heating process would burn away the glucose leaving the dealer with only half a kilo of crack. The same kilo cut with Bezocaine or Lidocaine would not reduce in volume and subsequently the profits available by cutting the cocaine with the chemicals mentioned would greatly increase.The United Kingdom threat assessment for cocaine importation is set at forty tonnes per year at eighty percent ( 80%) purity at the point of importation. Street seizures during the period of the investigation revealed purity to be as low as ten percent (10%). It is believed that the chemicals imported by the OCG had potentially doubled the amount of cocaine available to the end user.In response to the threat various UK law enforcement agencies seized chemicals and made a number of arrests of persons involved in the importation/distribution of the chemicals. The possession and onward supply of these cutting agents is not in itself a criminal offence and it was quickly established that bringing charges and a successful prosecution against those involved would be extremely difficult.Advice from the Crown Prosecution Service was that any realistic chance of prosecution would have to establish that those involved had the requisite knowledge and intent from the outset to supply the chemicals to drug dealers.The OCG comprised of the three main individuals, however, over 30 individuals were arrested in connection with this enquiry, all involved to a lesser degree with transport and money laundering. There were twenty-two separate UK linked seizures of drugs, cash and firearms the majority of which lead to prosecutions made by SOCA and its law enforcement partners. The three named individuals were jointly engaged in the importation of chemicals being used to adulterate and bulk significant quantities of controlled drugs. It has been established that between 2005 and 2008 these three men imported approximately forty tonnes of chemical cutting agents. The Home Office Forensic Science Service estimated a realisation value to the United Kingdom illicit drugs trade of between 3.5 and 14 billion pounds.Greaves was instrumental in arranging money transfers in excess of £100,000 from his vehicle sales company to legitimate importers of chemicals. He then falsified his accounts to hide these transactions.Commencement of the InvestigationIn November 2006 Dorset Police searched a premise in the Bournemouth area and recovered significant quantities of cocaine with a street value of 1.5 million pounds and cash totalling 1.7 million pounds. The drugs were found to be at various stages of adulteration. Also recovered were a number of barrels of the chemical Lidocaine and it was established that the premises were being used on an industrial scale to cut/mix cocaine.From markings on the barrels a legitimate supplier was identified in the Brighton area who when visited stated he had supplied the chemicals to an Andrew BLOMLEY who he believed had a chain of chemist shops in the North West of the UK. It was apparent that he had supplied these and other barrels of chemicals to BLOMLEY and was currently in the process of delivering a further shipment of sixty drums each weighing ( 25 kgs ) twenty five kilos (total 1.5 tonnes ) It was quickly established that BLOMLEY was a false identity giving sufficient grounds to instigate further enquiries.Due to geographical nature of the enquiry primacy of the investigation went to the Serious Organised Crime Agency and was given the name Operation JUNKO. This Operation was also, to link with Project Kitley within SOCA. The initial objectives being1. Identify the OCG’s importing or using such chemicals, the structure and logistics of their criminal business and also the full nature and scale of the criminality.2. Ensure the effective co-ordination of collaborative working arrangements and engagement of relevant partners in the UK and abroad based on shared knowledge, common interest and mutual support.3. Build knowledge of the finances of these OCG’s, including the identification of assets, accounts and use of criminal profits as well as money laundering methods and use of specialists and thereby:-a. Inform Project Kitley with a clear picture of the scale of cutting agents use in the illegal supply of class A drugs in the UK, including an understanding of the finances involved.b. Identify a number of OCG’s and disrupt or dismantle them by operational activity.c. Reduce the amount of such chemicals available for sale to individuals in the UKd. Conduct an intelligence assessment examining the acquisition, importation and use of cutting agents.e. Conduct a systematic forensic analysis of seized class A samples to identify cutting agents.f. Seek opportunities for operational deployment by SOCA or partner agencies with a view to disrupting or dismantling OCG’s engaged in this trade.g. Seize class A drugs and consignments of cutting agentsh. Seize criminal assets.Some of these objectives were subsequently altered or prioritised differently due to ethical and legal implications the main ones being:-The decision to allow cutting agents to run on potentially into the hands of drug dealer and down the supply chain to the public.The importation of such chemicals was not in itself illegal.Advice was immediately sought from the Crown Prosecution Service and a Senior Advocate was allocated to the investigation. From the outset there was close liaison between the case team and CPS,Initially a controlled delivery was made to the OCG in the North of the UK and the composition of this organisation slowly established utilising conventional surveillance, telecommunications analysis and financial analysis. A forensic and technical strategy was also developed whereby any consignment which was identified as destined for this OCG would be uniquely marked and on occasions technical equipment deployed.The forensic marker would allow all individual barrels found later at the site of drugs seizures to be identified as those supplied by the OCG and thus establishing the breadth and scale of the operation.The deployment of technical equipment would assist in finding such sites and establishing that these random barrels were only ever destined for illicit purposes and thus there was never any intention to supply these chemicals to licit users. These sites or cutting houses were often found during the course of normal law enforcement activity and linked back to the SOCA enquiry after intelligence dissemination and educational inputs to such organisations.This strategy subsequently identified 22 such seizures throughout England and Scotland often accompanied with cash and firearms.It was hoped that this evidence could then be turned against the OCG to secure a conviction.Surveillance surrounding the delivery of the barrels identified BLOMLEY as Jamie Stephen DALE who operated a business making diesel from waste oil products, none of the chemicals subject to the enquiry are used in this process.It also identified two further males having access to the barrels of chemicals.John CAWLEY was seen on a number of occasions moving and delivering barrels. It was also later proven that he was involved in depositing cash payments and obtaining storage space using false details.Barry HARTLEY, who has previous drugs convictions, was seen in possession of the barrels and in meetings with other known drug dealers.Account monitoring orders were placed on these individuals and their businesses. On occasions cash deposited by them was seized and forensically examined. This determined that the large quantities of cash were originating with sources involved in the drugs trade due to the significantly high traces of controlled drugs found on the notes. This type of monitoring also assisted in establishing the impending dates of chemical importations together with their value, method of payment and source.To support the investigation a number of expert witnesses were identified who provided the knowledge surrounding the illegitimate and the legitimate uses of the chemicals, among those used were experts in forensic toxicology, medicine, dental anaesthetics, veterinary health, fish farming, plastics manufacturing and bio diesel production. In addition to these an expert in chemical engineering was tasked with providing a report on the overall manufacture and consumption of the said chemicals.The findings of this report indicated that the amount of chemicals imported by this OCG represented twenty percent of the global production over the period of the conspiracy. Furthermore, the Forensic Science Service used the data they held on the national trends of drug seizures to estimate that the realisation value of the chemicals imported by DALE would generate a profit at street level between 3.5 and 14 billion pounds.Analysis of telecommunications data, although time consuming, proved essential in provenancing the fact that DALE was using false identities and established numerous opportunities to gather supporting evidence of his connections and influence.DALE, the head of the OCG, had no previous convictions and so a bad character officer was appointed to establish evidence of misconduct of the OCG and those individuals they were observed to meet with. This built up a formidable picture of a cutting agent OCG holding regular meetings with known and convicted drug suppliers.In excess of three thousand witness statements were obtained to both support evidence of the importation and distribution of the chemicals and negate any potential defences of legitimacy that might be proffered by the OCG.Based upon all the evidence including the seizures, expert witnesses, financial irregularities, falseidentities and the bad character of individuals linked to the investigation a comprehensive advice filewas submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service.The reviewing lawyer from Crown Prosecution Service supported the findings of the advice file and agreed that the investigation had sufficient grounds to arrest and interview those involved.In July 2008 SOCA officers assisted by over two hundred police officers from across the region arrested DALE, HARTLEY, CAWLEY together with more than a dozen others and search warrants were executed at multiple premises.During the searches large quantities of cash were recovered along with mobile telephones, computers, electronic storage devices and documentation.DALE disputed his involvement with drug dealers and stated he was a legitimate business man, he denied using or being connected to any of the false identities.John CAWLEY made no reply throughout his interviews.Barry HARTLEY also disputed his involvement in criminality stating he used the chemicals to medicate his show jumping horses (this being rebutted by the equestrian veterinary expert) Examination of the seized cash identified it to be heavily contaminated with controlled drugs and evidence gleaned from mobile phones and computers further pointed to DALE being BLOMLEY.The Crown Prosecution gave a positive decision to charge the three based upon the following.The sheer amount of chemicals being imported by the OCG. (20% of the global production.)The lack of any business records or legitimate customers for the chemicals in question.The twenty two linked seizures of drugs, cash and firearms and a number of ancillary prosecutions by SOCA and our law enforcement partners.Telephone evidence connecting one or all three of the suspects with the above drug dealers.The expert evidence of the legitimate and illegitimate uses of the chemicalsThe cash rich lifestyle enjoyed by the three including expensive jewellery, properties, holidays and vehicles.Money recovered from the suspects being heavily contaminated with controlled drugs.The previous bad character of HARTLEY and the third party bad character of the people who he met.Evidence of surveillance officers who overheard snippets of conversation relating to drugs.The staggering realisation value of several billion pounds set by the FSS.Much of the above evidence was circumstantial when looked at in isolation however, when considered collectively it clearly demonstrated the guilty knowledge and intent required to support a successful prosecution.Based on the types of drugs recovered at the different seizures all three were charged with conspiracy to supply class A and class B drugs under section ( 4 ) of The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and section 1( 1) of the Criminal Law Act 1977.The final prosecution file was paginated at over ten thousand pages and in excess of thirty thousand items of unused material had to be considered and categorised.",drug offences,0
"In 2005 the Metropolitan Police Service, (MPS) began an investigation into the activities of a number of career criminals who were engaged in the importation and distribution of Cocaine. The general profile of the Senior members indicated many had previous convictions for armed robbery, but had now diversified into the lucrative Cocaine market. Many had strong geographical links to a specific part of South East London.Common links were identified between Spain, Holland and the UK, where members of these OCN’s had strong criminal associations. These were principally with other London based criminals, but also with locally based, and international Cocaine Importers.As a result of a number of Operations good intelligence sharing protocols were established with Dutch and Spanish law enforcement. In September 2007 Police officers from the Dutch National Crime Squad, (DNCS) were investigating the activities of two male UK nationals resident in Holland whom they suspected were involved in the unlawful supply of cocaine, heroin and amphetamines. Telephone conversations made by these subjects to further their criminal enterprises were recorded by the DNCS.MPS officers identified one of the males as Richard WRIGHT (aka George WRIGHT), a South London career criminal, with previous convictions for drugs, firearms and robbery. WRIGHT was also wanted by officers from UK Customs for his involvement in the importation of 29kgs into the UK in 2004. The second male remained unidentified and was an older male who also used the name of ‘George’.On the 18th September 2007 the DNCS investigation culminated in the when intelligence received by the DNCS led to the arrest of several other males connected to Wright and ‘George’ and the seizure of 37 kilos of high grade cocaine destined for the UK. (Street value £3.7 million).Within days of their arrest the older male ‘George’ was identified as Alan Leo BYRNE. He was wanted by UK Police having escaped from custody in 1995 and assisted in his escape by a group of armed men. At the time of his escape BYRNE was serving a term of life imprisonment for armed robbery and murder, having shot dead a custodian during the course of a robbery.During their investigation the DNCS established that a man known only as ‘Jeff’ was in constant phone contact with WRIGHT and the recorded content of their conversations was purely criminal. Consignments of amphetamines (believed to be 200kgs), bolstered by the addition of cocaine and heroin, were discussed and arranged on a regular basis by the two men. ‘Jeff’ organised the movement of monies by couriers from the UK to the Netherlands as payment for these drugs. ‘Jeff’ also indicated the involvement of others in these in these enterprises in particular his son ‘Joe’.In October 2007 ‘Jeff’ was identified by MPS officers as being Jeffrey CHAPPELL. Covert surveillance identified other associates, one of whom, SAMUEL, was arrested in possession of 41Kg of Cocaine in November 2007.Further covert surveillance continued, and it was identified CHAPPELL used several public phone boxes. Covert cameras were placed on these to obtain evidence to identify the caller, and corroborate calls made from that call box, to Holland which were monitored and contained evidence of drug trafficking.The CHAPPELL’s were subsequently arrested and released on police bail pending further enquiries. These included liaison with the DNCS, and the release of the intercept material, lawfully obtained in Holland. As a result of this material, supported by other circumstantial material they were subsequently charged with conspiracy to supply cocaine.",drug offences,0
"A criminal group, including the defendant Juan Ignacio Spila, committed fraud by masquerading as a Banco Galicia employee. The group sent an Instagram message to the victim informing her that if she wanted receive advice from the financial institution, she should provide her cell phone and her area code.

"The case involved Internet gambling. A criminal group operated RAPOKER, which offered online games of chance and betting services without proper authorization. The criminal group had a pyramid structure. The members divided roles and responsibilities between them, and roles were based on the power of decision-making, the percentage of commission that they would charge, and the number of people they oversaw. The heads of the group, Raúl Daniel Marchisio and Iván Maciel Cicala, managed RAPOKER’s operations and ATM networks. Leonardo Maximiliano Perelli, another member of the group, was accountable to Raúl Daniel Marchisio and Iván Maciel Cicala. He created the “profeleopoker” ATM network, served as an organizer of Internet gambling services, and oversaw advertising through social networks and closing monthly-end balances, among other responsibilities. Paul Daniel Swistoniuk served as an operator in the group and an intermediary between “tellers” and “cashiers” in the group, informing them, for example, how to load credit and chips on panels when cashiers requested them and where to send money transfers when payments were made.

"This case involved a criminal group that committed ATM jackpotting, a cybercrime that exploits both physical and software ATM vulnerabilities to make the ATMs dispense cash. The group targeted ATMs in remote physical locations without security guards. Their method of operation was to travel to banks to obtain physical access to the ATMs by forcing the front door of the ATM with a screwdriver, accessing the interior of the central processing unit (CPU), disconnecting the USB cable that connects the ATM CPU to its peripherals, including the bill dispenser, and replacing it with their own cable and connecting it to a laptop. They used specialized software to alter the functioning of the ATM and to dispense cash.   The group included five named individuals, the two defendants (Lisett Dayana Francis Jameson and Saddam José Caruso Sotillo) and three associates, Julio César Caruso Sotillo, Ruditt José Martínez Pinango, and Luis Abrahán Dos Santos Cantillo. Other unnamed individuals were also involved in the cybercrime. The group divided its roles among members. Some members were involved in the physical access to the ATM and the collection of the money while others engaged in surveillance or other essential tasks to the completion of the cybercrime. They obtained ARS 871,900 from the Bank of the Province of Cordoba ATMs they targeted.  The defendants were charged and convicted for criminal association and co-author and participant in fraud by computer manipulation. For her crimes and cybercrimes, Lisett Dayana Francis Jameson received three years and three months’ imprisonment for her crimes. Saddam José Caruso Sotillo received four years and three months’ for the crimes in relation to the present case. The court unified this sanction with another sentence and ordered a single sentence of six year’s imprisonment.

"The current case initiated as two separate, independent investigations before the local and federal law enforcement forces of the city of Neuquén. When the connection between both inquiries was detected, they were merged into one single case. As a result of the aforementioned investigations, the Court was able to establish the existence of an organization dedicated to the recruitment of Dominican women through deception, and their transportation to Mar del Plata, Argentina, with the purpose of subjecting them to sexual exploitation.The Dominican citizen D.D.M., was recruited and transported by R.A.A.C. The victim and R.A.A.C. left Santo Domingo on the 1st of February of 2010, and travelled to Lima, Peru by airplane. They later crossed the border crossing of Villazón-La Quiaca by foot, and arrived in Mar del Plata, Argentina, on February 5. Taking advantage of D.D.M.’s vulnerability, and with the false promise of a job at a shampoo factory or at a restaurant, which would help D.D.M. overcome her difficult economic situation, R.A.A.C. recruited the victim and transported her to the venue known as “D” in Mar del Plata.However, once she discovered the deception and the true activity she would be subjected to, D.D.M. suffered a nervous breakdown. Due to her emotional breakdown, on the following day C.C.C. asked R.A.A.C. to take D.D.M. away from their establishment. Finding herself in that situation, in an unfamiliar  city and without the necessary money to go back to her country, the victim was forced to go with R.A.A.C. to two similar night venues, where she was subjected to sexual exploitation. Finally, D.D.M. was able to escape this exploitative situation thanks to the assistance provided by residents of Neuquén, which allowed her to denounce the situation before the Fedetal Prosecutor.Similarly, the Court considered that it had been fully proven by the many testimonies received during the course of the trial, as well as by the body of evidence incorporated, that D.M.J.T. and J.C.Z. had been recruited and transported from the Dominican Republic to Mar del Plata. The victims were lured with a sham job offer and deceived through the abuse of their position of vulnerability. The victims were harboured in the dwelling located in Sal Salvador Street in Mar del plata. The defendants used coercive mechanisms, including penalties or fines, as well as the fabrication of financial debts, with the purpose of submitting them to sexual exploitation. This situation continued at least from the 28-06-2008, until the  19-04-2010, when the federal local law enforcement forces carried out a raid on the premises. On that occasion, law enforcement were able to verify the presence of several citizens from Dominican Republic – M.M.S., Y.A.A., S.U.R., and J.I.E.U. inside the establishment. These women were living in appalling sanitation and overcrowding conditions, and were also being subjected to exploitation.The investigation regarding these acts initiated as a response to the complaint filed by D.M.J.T. before the Human Trafficking Delegation of the Federal Police on the 11th of March of 2010, after managing to escape with the help of a third person, and running  away to the city of Buenos Aires.The victim reported that she had been recruited in the Dominican Republic together with nine other women, by a man named “T.”, who offered her the possibility of travelling to Spain, with the promise of obtaining a visa for her. The victim gave this man the deed to her house in the Dominican Republic, as a collateral to guarantee the payment for the travel arrangements. However, once the victim arrived at the airport of Santo Domingo to travel to Spain, this man told them that they would have to pass through Argentina first, as the visas were more easily obtained in Argentina. Once in Argentina, the victims were received and transported by a man called “J.”, and stayed at his personal domicile for ten days. She was then transported to a nightclub called “D.”. Once at “D.”, J. brought a few suitcases filled with underwear and lingerie, and told the women that there had been complications with the processing of the visas, and that they would have to work at the bar and prostitute theselves. He threatened the victims and told them that if they didn’t comply, they would lose their houses in the Dominican Republic.From that moment onwards, the victims were entrapped in the nightlub, and they were not allowed to leave the premises under any circumstances. The victims were forced to engage in prostitution and to live in the same rooms in which they provided sexual services. In her testimony, D.M.J.T. mentioned a man called “F.”, who was J.’s son, and was the person in charge of the club. “F.” was responsible of charging customers for the sexual services performed and for the drinks consumed. He also fined the women and imposed penalties if a client complained for any reason, and charged the victims 400 pesos to pay off the police, and 300 pesos to pay for food and other expenses. The victim never received any money, because according to J., she had to repay the debt generated by her travel arrangements, to pay for the costs of her stay at the nightclub, and for the promised trip to Spain. After being in this situation for three months, the victim was able to escape with the help of a customer.As to J.C.Z., she was recruited by her aunt, O.V.M. and her husband, J.S in June of 2008, with the promise of a job at O.V.M.’s beauty salon. However, upon arrival to Argentina, she found out the real nature of the activity she would be subjected to. J.C.Z. recounted the psychological abuse she suffered, as well as the coactive environment in which they lived, subject to constant violent threats, and even death threats. She also explained that the defendants simulated a supportive and prosperous environment, and forced the victims to record videos sending regards to their families, and to have their pictures taken at O.V.M.’s beauty salon, to convince their families that they were happy and working at that place.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The two accused, DSC and MRM, went to the address of the victim, C, in San Antonio de Antigal in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, where they were in communication with C and her family.

The two accused and the victim boarded a taxi to Tarija, near the border with Argentina, and on arrival boarded a different taxi to be transported to the border. At that border, a raft was waiting to transport them and others to Argentina. Once in Argentina, both accused met a group waiting to transfer them to the Argentine city of San Pedro de Jujuy. They boarded another taxi and arrived at a house in San Pedro. It should be noted that this house was later raided by police, but nothing relevant to the case was found. At that house, the accused DSC retained C’s identity card and asked C to memorise the details of an identification document belonging to the Argentinian citizen Ms Lorena Caliva, so that C could use the identification to transfer to Mendoza under a false identity. On 9 November 2014 the two accused and the victim caught a bus toward Mendoza.

"The case is related to the crime of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation that occurred in a brothel called “The Sheik” in Ushuaia, committed by a man and two women. Seven women, captured and transported by one of the defendants, were exploited at the brothel from November 2011 to October 2012. They also lived in the property of one of the defendants (Pedro Montoya), who was responsible for the exploitation. The system they used was one of “copas” and “pases”, were women approached men firstly (copas) before providing sexual services (pases).  Furthermore, the Municipality frequently held visits to check compliance with Municipal Order Number 4162, requiring sanitary notebooks for women exercising prostitution. This Order was repealed in August 2012.                           There was an abuse of the situation of vulnerability, as all of the victims were women with low incomes, low levels of education, and who came from poor families who they had to support financially. Furthermore, it was proven that women received only a percentage of the money, and that they lived in the premises in precarious conditions. They were also required to request permission in order to leave, and faced constant debt.In November 2011, the Argentinean Human Trafficking Prosecutor Office (PROTEX) received a testimony in the framework of another case (Case 873/2011), motivating this office to file a complaint in 12 April 2012, initiating the present case.On 25 November 2014, Victim 1 initiated a civil action against two of the defendants and the Municipality of Ushuaia, claiming compensation for the damages suffered as a consequence of the sexual exploitation.",trafficking in persons,1
"Ms Vargas would have recruited the minor, of 12 years old, promising to bring her to Argentina to study. After transferring her illegally, without documentation, passing her off as her daughter, the victim was receipt by the defendant for a labour exploitation making her perform servitude tasks at home, treating her bad, and not paying her what has been agreed.The Case was initiated on 30th May 2011 following a presentation made to the Police Station by the minor, who went to there after the niece of a neighbour reported to the police the sayings of the minor regarding alleged beatings and abuses, of which she was victim.The minor lived in Bolivia with her mother and seven siblings; her mother gave her the permission to go to Argentina with her aunt Cinthia (defendant) and her husband (defendant).

"The current case initiated as two separate, independent investigations before the local and federal law enforcement forces of the city of Neuquén. When the connection between both inquiries was detected, they were merged into one single case. As a result of the aforementioned investigations, the Court was able to establish the existence of an organization dedicated to the recruitment of Dominican women through deception, and their transportation to Mar del Plata, Argentina, with the purpose of subjecting them to sexual exploitation.The Dominican citizen D.D.M., was recruited and transported by R.A.A.C. The victim and R.A.A.C. left Santo Domingo on the 1st of February of 2010, and travelled to Lima, Peru by airplane. They later crossed the border crossing of Villazón-La Quiaca by foot, and arrived in Mar del Plata, Argentina, on February 5. Taking advantage of D.D.M.’s vulnerability, and with the false promise of a job at a shampoo factory or at a restaurant, which would help D.D.M. overcome her difficult economic situation, R.A.A.C. recruited the victim and transported her to the venue known as “D” in Mar del Plata.However, once she discovered the deception and the true activity she would be subjected to, D.D.M. suffered a nervous breakdown. Due to her emotional breakdown, on the following day C.C.C. asked R.A.A.C. to take D.D.M. away from their establishment. Finding herself in that situation, in an unfamiliar  city and without the necessary money to go back to her country, the victim was forced to go with R.A.A.C. to two similar night venues, where she was subjected to sexual exploitation. Finally, D.D.M. was able to escape this exploitative situation thanks to the assistance provided by residents of Neuquén, which allowed her to denounce the situation before the Fedetal Prosecutor.Similarly, the Court considered that it had been fully proven by the many testimonies received during the course of the trial, as well as by the body of evidence incorporated, that D.M.J.T. and J.C.Z. had been recruited and transported from the Dominican Republic to Mar del Plata. The victims were lured with a sham job offer and deceived through the abuse of their position of vulnerability. The victims were harboured in the dwelling located in Sal Salvador Street in Mar del plata. The defendants used coercive mechanisms, including penalties or fines, as well as the fabrication of financial debts, with the purpose of submitting them to sexual exploitation. This situation continued at least from the 28-06-2008, until the  19-04-2010, when the federal local law enforcement forces carried out a raid on the premises. On that occasion, law enforcement were able to verify the presence of several citizens from Dominican Republic – M.M.S., Y.A.A., S.U.R., and J.I.E.U. inside the establishment. These women were living in appalling sanitation and overcrowding conditions, and were also being subjected to exploitation.The investigation regarding these acts initiated as a response to the complaint filed by D.M.J.T. before the Human Trafficking Delegation of the Federal Police on the 11th of March of 2010, after managing to escape with the help of a third person, and running  away to the city of Buenos Aires.The victim reported that she had been recruited in the Dominican Republic together with nine other women, by a man named “T.”, who offered her the possibility of travelling to Spain, with the promise of obtaining a visa for her. The victim gave this man the deed to her house in the Dominican Republic, as a collateral to guarantee the payment for the travel arrangements. However, once the victim arrived at the airport of Santo Domingo to travel to Spain, this man told them that they would have to pass through Argentina first, as the visas were more easily obtained in Argentina. Once in Argentina, the victims were received and transported by a man called “J.”, and stayed at his personal domicile for ten days. She was then transported to a nightclub called “D.”. Once at “D.”, J. brought a few suitcases filled with underwear and lingerie, and told the women that there had been complications with the processing of the visas, and that they would have to work at the bar and prostitute theselves. He threatened the victims and told them that if they didn’t comply, they would lose their houses in the Dominican Republic.From that moment onwards, the victims were entrapped in the nightlub, and they were not allowed to leave the premises under any circumstances. The victims were forced to engage in prostitution and to live in the same rooms in which they provided sexual services. In her testimony, D.M.J.T. mentioned a man called “F.”, who was J.’s son, and was the person in charge of the club. “F.” was responsible of charging customers for the sexual services performed and for the drinks consumed. He also fined the women and imposed penalties if a client complained for any reason, and charged the victims 400 pesos to pay off the police, and 300 pesos to pay for food and other expenses. The victim never received any money, because according to J., she had to repay the debt generated by her travel arrangements, to pay for the costs of her stay at the nightclub, and for the promised trip to Spain. After being in this situation for three months, the victim was able to escape with the help of a customer.As to J.C.Z., she was recruited by her aunt, O.V.M. and her husband, J.S in June of 2008, with the promise of a job at O.V.M.’s beauty salon. However, upon arrival to Argentina, she found out the real nature of the activity she would be subjected to. J.C.Z. recounted the psychological abuse she suffered, as well as the coactive environment in which they lived, subject to constant violent threats, and even death threats. She also explained that the defendants simulated a supportive and prosperous environment, and forced the victims to record videos sending regards to their families, and to have their pictures taken at O.V.M.’s beauty salon, to convince their families that they were happy and working at that place.",trafficking in persons,1
"The two accused, DSC and MRM, went to the address of the victim, C, in San Antonio de Antigal in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, where they were in communication with C and her family. They proposed to transport her to Argentina. The accused alleged that her parents consented to that arrangement. The two accused and the victim boarded a taxi to Tarija, near the border with Argentina, and on arrival boarded a different taxi to be transported to the border. At that border, a raft was waiting to transport them and others to Argentina. Once in Argentina, both accused met a group waiting to transfer them to the Argentine city of San Pedro de Jujuy. They boarded another taxi and arrived at a house in San Pedro. It should be noted that this house was later raided by police, but nothing relevant to the case was found. At that house, the accused DSC retained C’s identity card and asked C to memorise the details of an identification document belonging to the Argentinian citizen Ms Lorena Caliva, so that C could use the identification to transfer to Mendoza under a false identity. On 9 November 2014 the two accused and the victim caught a bus toward Mendoza. DSC covered C’s face with a blanket during the entirety of the trip. On 12 November 2014 the National Gendarmerie was carrying out migratory customs control in the La Merced area. It was confirmed that C did not correspond with the identity documents that she held. The accused claimed that they transported C so that she could work harvesting garlic in Mendoza.",trafficking in persons,1
"A criminal organization of 13 defendants recruited and transported at least 32 victims from Bolivia to Argentina, in order to exploit them at various weaving workshops. The recruitment was done in person, as well as through advertisements in the T.V. and the radio. As for the transportation, some of the victims travelled to Argentina with the defendants, in their private vehicles; other victims received a paid ticket from the defendants, which was later deduced from their wages. The victims were harboured at the workshops and in private properties nearby, from where the defendants transported them to the place of work in vans. Most of the victims came to Argentina with their families.The defendants deceived the victims and abused their position of vulnerability (the victims were migrants, in situation of poverty, and lacked employment opportunities in their country of origin). In addition, they threatened some of them, and retained their documents to ensure they would work for them for at least one year.The victims were told they will receive all of their monthly wages together, at the end of the year. However, the majority of the victims did not receive any money. Furthermore, they did not have any contract and they worked from Monday to Saturday, from 7 am. to 10 pm. approximately. The victim’s freedom of movement was limited, since there was only one key to enter and to leave the place.  Deductions were made to their salaries for their living expenses (food and shelter) and whenever they could not show up in the workshop.Women performed services such as cooking, cleaning or babysitting.The Tribunal acquitted S.C.C. by application of the non-punishment clause enshrined in Article 5 of the Law 26.364.",trafficking in persons,1
"Cardaci and Mossolini (who is a police officer) were charged of harbouring 4 Paraguayan women in Arana (in La Plata) to exploit them sexually, promoting and facilitating the prostitution, with the alleged collaboration of Melo as a secondary participant.The place where the prostitution was taking place was a “restaurant” which only functioned behind closed doors with bars in between, without any sign identifying it. To have an access it was necessary to ring a bell and wait to be served.According to what has been reported by victims, the main accused was holding fifty per cent of what they earned. The “working hours” started at 6 pm (Except on Saturdays and Sundays that it started at 3 pm) until 3 or 4 am. And they worked from Tuesday till Sunday. They didn’t work on Monday, and they had them controlled when they were going out. The victims were receiving a weekly salary, and had to pay for their food.One of the victims stated that though they were not obliged to have sex with whom they choose not to, it could lead to negative consequences. Also they shouted at them if they were slow in serving the customers.They could go out with a friend or client on their day off, but they had to leave a “deposit” of five hundred pesos.The police officer went to the place where prostitution was practiced, and got free meals.The statements of Cardaci himself showed that he knew well about the personal circumstances of the victims, and that he was aware of their precarious economic situation. He said that he had travelled repeatedly to Paraguay to take the girls, he knew where they lived, and maintained a direct relationship with their families.The complaint that initiated the case took place in the UFASE on the 25th of October 2012, who made a preliminary report, and ordered intelligence investigations, which corroborated the complaint.One of the victims testified by videoconference and for the three other victims, their statements were incorporated in the investigations in the presence of the technical assistant of Cardaci.Mossolini’s collaboration was essential, because it ensured that women “work” freely and be harboured and housed, since he would warn them in case of a raid.In addition, the police station was one block away from the brothel, and everyone knew each other (Arana). So if the girls had wanted to escape, they would have found them, and returned them to the brothel.Regarding Melo, who was acquitted, the Prosecutor considered him as an employee of the place, who took salary from Cardaci.The report of the Office of Rescue (Oficina de Rescate) stated that the victims were in a vulnerable situation and that they were abused.",trafficking in persons,1
"The case is related to the sexual exploitation committed by 5 persons in a brothel called “Afrodita”, against two adult victims from Paraguay, between September and November 2008.

"On dates that cannot be accurately determined, but prior to the 21/01/2009, Alicia Concepción Vargas Leulan, in collusion with Oscar Eduardo Desabato, recruited M.V.N. and C.R.C. (both Paraguayan nationals) through deception, and taking advantage of their position of vulnerability.Vargas Leulan transported and transferred the two young girls from Paraguay to the town of Cruz Alta, accompanying the victims over the border crossing between Paraguay and Argentina (on the 21/01/2009). And then by bus (she paid for the bus tickets with the money that Desabato had sent her for this purpose) from Posadas to Rosario, and then they boarded another bus to Cruz Alta. Once in this town, the girls were taken to a bar known as “El Quincho” by taxi. On their arrival, they girls were told about the work they would have to perform, doing “drinks” – getting customers to invite them to drinks- and “passes” – offering sexual services in exchange for a previously stipulated sum of money. Furthermore, the defendant Oscar Eduardo Desabato told the victims that they would be discounted $700 pesos from the money they generated to pay for the bus tickets that he had purchased for them through Vargas Leulan; another sum of approximately $500 pesos for what Vargas Leulan charged him for their recruitment; as well as the cost of food, medical tests, etc. He also proceeded to retain the identity documents of the girls.The victims had to perform countless “passes” with the customers of that establishment, and although they wanted to leave, Desabato told them that they could not leave until they paid back the amount he had paid for them and the other costs that they had generated. He threatened them, saying that if they left, they would not get any of the money they had already generated. For this reason, one of the girls resorted to a friend of hers, and asked him to send a total of $210 pesos in order to be able to go back home, since the money that she had generated, after  subtracting the aforementioned “costs” was not enough to pay for her  bus tickets home.This situation went on until the 27/01/2009, when, pursuant to a complain made by the father of one of the victims, the Argentine Federal Police  searched the establishment “El Quincho” and proceeded to identify and assist the victims.",trafficking in persons,1
"On the 13th April 2011, the 1st Police Precinct of Chajarí received an anonymous call informing about the situation of two women who were were being forced to stay in a room at the Caribe II Hotel under threat, and who had been given narcotic drugs.Pursuant to this information, the police arrived at the scene and found two females –one of them was a minor- who told them that they had been taken to the hotel by a man known as “Tito” -defendant Cardozo- and that they were afraid because he had threatened them and said that they had to work for him “selling their bodies”. They also stated that they had been given drugs and alcohol by “Tito”.As this was happening, the younger of the two girls started receiving calls and text messages from “Tito” on her mobile phone, who said that he was going to pick them up at the hotel. When he arrived at the scene, he was intercepted by the police and identified as Sergio Raúl Cardozo.At the police station, the victims expanded on their testimonies and recounted how they had arrived at Chajarí on the 12th of April, and how they had been received at the bus station by Cardozo. The girls had travelled to Chajarí because one of them (the minor) knew Cardozo -with whom she had a relationship- and he had offered her a job. They stated that he had taken them to an apartment, where he locked them and left them to stay the night. Later on, Antonio Gabriel Nonino arrived at the dwelling, and told them that they could not leave the apartment until Cardozo was back.On the 13th of April, the defendants –Cardozo and Nonino- had taken the victims to a bar, where they were offered cocaine by “Tito”, which they all consumed. It was then that Cardozo told them that he wanted them to work for him engaging in prostitution, and that he would give them a percentage of the money they made. He then told them they could not stay at the apartment and took them to the Caribe II hotel, where they consumed marihuana, alcohol and cocaine, which was once again supplied by Cardozo.

Novello and López López located and transported the minors from the republic of Paraguay (where López López is from originally) and provided them with the use of rooms at the brothel, in order to engage in this activity. As a result, the minors provided sexual services in exchange for price or money to undetermined clients or “johns” at the premises. The girls received a part of the money earned with each sexual service provided or with every “pass” –presumably half of its value- while Novello, who also set the prices at the brothel, took the other half.",trafficking in persons,0
"The present case and the corresponding investigation led by the Argentine National Gendarmerie was prompted by an anonymous call made to the Office for the Rescue and Support of Persons Affected by the Offence of Human Trafficking. This call informed about the situation of several minors who, according to the complainant, were being sexually exploited for prostitution in different whiskey bars/cabarets located in the town of Ituzaingó. Following this information, search warrants were requested and obtained for several locations, among which was the whiskey bar known as “Señor Mongo” or “El Misionero”.Thus, this case arises from the search conducted on 19 February 2010 in the aforementioned dwelling. During the course of this procedure, three female minors were found inside a locked room at the premises. One of the girls expressed at that time that she had been living and working as a prostitute at that place for a week. The minors were identified as witness “A.”, 14 years old, witness “B.”, 14 years old, and witness “E.”, who claimed to be 14 but was later found to be 12 years old at the time. These last two girls (“B.” and “E.”) were sisters and of Paraguayan nationality.The minors were sexually exploited by the owner of the “bar” - Mondo - and his mistress - Isabel Borges de Lima -, who also forced them to drink alcohol and use drugs.Several condoms and used packets of intimate gel were found on the floor in the same room that the minors were found in. Two adult females were found in another room, working as prostitutes. Similarly, one other adult female was identified at the premises, as well as five men.As a result of the search, Juan Carlos Mondo was arrested, the three minors were removed from the premises (the witnesses “A.”, “B.” and “E.”), and relevant items were seized such as three personal SIM cards and a mobile phone belonging to Juan Carlos Mondo.",trafficking in persons,1
"This case was opened in the wake of a preliminary investigation carried out by UFASE (The Unit for the Prosecution of and Assistance in Extortive Kidnappings and Human Trafficking of the City of Buenos Aires), following a complaint made by one of the victims in 2008. The victim (M.S.B.C.) reported having been harboured at a house located next to a nightclub called “J.C.”, where she was -along with other women- subjected to sexual exploitation. She also mentioned a hotel called “California” but was unable to recall its geographic location. The victim identified a woman, known to them as “La Tía” (“The Aunt”), as the manager of the club; and a man who went by the nickname “Puchi”, and his wife called Vanesa as the owners.Having received this information, the Prosecutor requested a formal investigation, which was carried out by the Airport Security Police. This enquiry corroborated several facts reported by M.S.B.C.: the existence of the “California II” hotel, as well as the existence of a club called “J.C.”, both located in the city of Tandil; the presence of multiple women of Paraguayan nationality who were being prostituted in the premises; the presence of the suspects described by the victim, who were identified as “La Tía”, “Vanesa” and “Puchi”.The Federal Police confirmed that the brothel was being promoted through advertisements placed in a local newspaper, which suggested that the criminal activity was still taking place at the premises.  Consequently, the judge issued search warrants for the club “JC” and for the adjoining dwelling in order to put an end to the denounced activity and to seize the elements that could be relevant to this case. The judge also ordered the arrest of the manager or of those responsible for the club and the adjoining residence, with the intervention of the Office for the Rescue and Support of People Harmed by Human Trafficking.During the search of the club “J.C.”, the Federal Police identified the manager –and here defendant- E.C.A., and reported the presence of 14 Paraguayan women who were being prostituted. Similarly, the officers searched the adjoining house, where they seized relevant elements and where they were able to corroborate the shameful hygiene conditions and the overcrowding that the women who were being exploited had to endure.The report compiled by the psychologists working at the Office for the Rescue and Support of People Affected by Human Trafficking described the state of vulnerability of the victims: they where women living in poverty in their country of origin (Paraguay), and most of them had young children in their care. This vulnerability was used by the traffickers in order to abuse and sexually exploit these women.",trafficking in persons,1
"In October 2009, one minor -C.E.J- and at least five adult women were harboured at the premises managed by the defendants. The aforementioned minor and adult women worked at the premises doing “drinks” and “passes” with clients (that is, offering sexual services). The earnings were split evenly between the workers and the defendants.The defendants were fully aware of the position of vulnerability of the victims and controlled them in order to exploit them.During the search of the premises carried out on 28 of October 2009, several items were seized: notes related to the activity, personal items, a vaginal exudate that belonged to A.C.V.G, and other elements. Similarly, another domicile connected to this activity was also searched. In this dwelling, law enforcement personnel found a suitcase with the personal belongings of one of the victims, a bus ticket in her name, a record of the loss of her I.D. card, photographs of her family, condoms, information about women who offered sexual services and flyers advertising the bar.",trafficking in persons,1
"This case was initiated following an anonymous call to the Local Office of the Argentinean Federal Police. This call reported that minors were being prostituted and drugs were being sold at a bar in the city of Paraná.As a result of this call, the Federal Police launched an investigation in order to corroborate the information received. On a first stage of the investigation, the police enquiry established the existence and location of the bar, and the presence of young women at the premises. Some of these young women were presumably minors, and in fact a 15 and a 16 year old were once seen leaving the bar. On the second stage, the police found that drugs were being consumed, and that a woman (adult) was offering sexual services within the premises. In addition to this, five or six young women, presumably minors, were seen peeking in from the back of the bar. Finally, several neighbors stated that the bartender was selling drugs and that there were rooms in the back of the bar, which were used by the women to engage in prostitution.Following these findings, a search of the bar was executed by the Argentinean Federal Police with the assistance of the Office for the Rescue and Support of Persons Affected by the Crime of Human Trafficking. Once inside the premises, the presence of nine women (adults and minors) and of four men was confirmed. The police proceeded to identify the women, among whom two were minors: G.A.N. and D.B.P.V. According to the testimonies of the relatives of the victims, the trafficker took advantage of the position of vulnerability of the victims, who were addicted to drugs, in order to exploit them sexually.",trafficking in persons,1
"The defendant, C. A. G., was accused of recruiting Y.Y.O. in February 2009, by taking advantage of his allegedly romantic relationship with her. C.A.G. convinced Y.Y.O., partly through deception, to travel to the city of Neuquén. According to his promises, she would work as a prostitute for fifteen days, in order to improve their financial situation, and that of the young children of Y.Y.O.Under these conditions, C.A.G. transported Y.Y.O. from Río Cuarto to Neuquén, where he harboured her in three different places: first at a hotel, where they stayed for around two months, and then in two different apartments, which C.A.G. rented under his own name.After the initial fifteen days, Y.Y.O. expressed her intention/interest to return to Río Cuarto, but C.A.G. opposed to it. From that moment onwards, C.A.G. started to act violently against Y.Y.O. Moreover, he hindered her freedom of movement, and began to lock her up in the places where they lived, and only allowing her to go out to engage in prostitution on the streets.Y.Y.O. allegedly worked as a prostitute during the night hours, first from 8.00 p.m. until 5.00 a.m., and afterwards, with the arrival of lower temperatures, from 9.00 p.m. to 3.00 a.m. She was constantly watched by C.A.G., who also approached the corner where O. was stationed waiting for customers, and took the money she received for this activity.This situation continued, until O. decided to escape from the apartment during one of G.’s outings, on the 2nd of October 2009. The landlady –who lived at another apartment in the same building - helped her escape, and she received protection from the Argentine Federal Police.",trafficking in persons,1
"The case involves 7 victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation in the brothel ‘Oasis’, owed by Pedro Alberto Ledesma. The exploitation occurred in the bedrooms inside the brothel, as well as in nearby hotels. The system of exploitation consisted of “copas” and “pases”, recorded in notebooks, were women approached men firstly (copas) before providing sexual services (pases).  50% of the money earned by the women was retained by Ledesma. Moreover, officials from the Municipality visited often the brothel, in order to control the sanitary booklets of the women exploited.All victims were in an economic and social situation of vulnerability, supporting financially their families, being single mothers, with migrant status and not possessing formal education.One of the defendants, M.C., was partner of the other defendant, Pedro Alberto Ledesma.

"Before 18 November 2012, J.C.C. allegedly recruited I.J by means of deception for the purpose of labour exploitation. The defendant took advantage of the victim's vulnerable situation and forced her to work at his sewing workshop located in his domicile in Esteban Echeverría, a province of Buenos Aires.Prosecutor Dr. C.D.D. estimated that the conduct of J.C.C violated article 145 bis of the Penal Code and requested a sentence of three years imprisonment and payment of court costs.",trafficking in persons,0
"On 3 April 2009, the Victims of Trafficking Rescue and Support Office  (Oficina de Rescate y Acompañamiento a personas damnificadas por el delito de Trata) made a formal accusation with the police after receiving an email from the Coordinator of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Program in the Dominican Republic, in which she informed that C. R. and D. M. of R. (both Dominican citizens) were victims of trafficking. These women traveled to Argentina believing that they would work in a beauty salon but were forced into prostitution.On 16 April 2009, the police conducted a search of the property. E. M. S. J. –female, Dominican, 39- claimed she was the one in charge of the place, hence she was arrested. However, in September provincial police found that the place continued to be active and advertised in the classifieds of the local newspaper La Capital. Another raid on 6 February 2010 resulted in E.M.S.J. being arrested again. In the property the police found two rooms with external locks on the doors and rescued a total of 11 victims with the initials J.A.P.M., C.R.S., D.M. of R., Y.A.S.M.

She charged the victims 50% of the money made from the prostitution, and fined them when they did not comply with the work-schedule set by her, which consisted of long shifts, few rest periods. In addition she imposed debts for accommodation, food, condoms, cleaning, advertising, lingerie.There were conditioning circumstances related to their freedom: lack of money, insecurity, ignorance of the place.

"The case is a result of a surveillance conducted in 2009 by the Chief of Security Police Department on the activities of a Bar called K.M.It was found that the bar operated as a brothel, open to the public daily from 11 p.m. Inside there was a bar with a wide variety of alcohol, there were tables, a jukebox, and several scantily clad women.The women, who were given drinks by men, offered sexual services in exchange for money.One of the officers managed to talk with one if the girls who stated that all the girls had to remain locked up in the premises, none had permission to go outside, they were threatened by the owners and they did not pay them the money from their work.The establishment was run by defendant M.I.C.After the investigation phase, on 4 December 2009 the Judge ordered a police raid at the premises of the “Bar” and remained proved that the establishment did not operate a commercial activity according to its rating.According to the victims testimonies, they were each contacted by one of the defendants to work at the brothel with the promise of being a waitress and earning a lot of money.The girls were in a vulnerable situation considering that one of them was illegal in the country and they could never save money to leave the country since they were paid very little for their work.",trafficking in persons,0
"This case was initiated pursuant to the preventive actions carried out by the Security Police of the Department of Pergamino. Through an undercover operation, the police were able to establish the existence of the establishment known as  “Kity Mollo”, “el Mollo”, “Mollo” or “el Mollo de Kity”, and the fact that prostitution was being practiced in its premises. The law enforcement forced continued with the investigation, and on the 4th of December 2009, the Deputy Lieutenant  A.J.G. entered the suspected premises covertly, along with  officers H.M. and I.M. On this opportunity, they determined the presence of seven women at the premises, and they were able to engage in conversation with the girls. One of the girls (J.E.R.) told them that she had been living in that place for three or four months, that she was not allowed to go out, that she was threatened and that they didn’t pay her share of the “passes” –sexual services provided- and that another girl was also in her situation.Pursuant to this information, a search of the premises was ordered. At the time of the search, eleven (11) men and five (5) women were found at the establishment. The women were wearing erotic lingerie and were identified as: J.E.F. (Dominican, 31 years old ), M.M.D. (Argentine), F.F.M. (Dominican), S.C.R.D. and J.E.R.    During her testimony before the National Gendarmerie personnel, J.E.R. recounted how she had met a girl named Cintia, who had offered her a job as a waitress or “doing drinks” in the region of Buenos Aires, who gave her a telephone number and told her to speak to a person called Mariana. J.E.R. narrated how she arrived in Buenos Aires on the 21st November 2009, and how Cintia was waiting for her at the bus station to take her to the bar. She also described how four girls lived at the premises, and said that there were also three Dominican women who worked, but didn’t live there. She states that the person in charge of the brothel was an older woman named Kity, who was Mariana’s mother, and who owned the establishment. She expressed that in the beginning, she was told to work “doing drinks”, which meant that every time a client invited her to a drink, she would earn a 50% of its cost. However, after a few weeks she was forced to do “pases” – this is, to provide sexual services- and she was told she would also earn a 50% of the price paid by the client. She said that Mariana locked her up all day, and that whenever the owners weren’t at the premises and couldn’t watch her, another man did. She said that she was never paid, that she ate once a day, also worked cleaning the premises, and that if she ever needed anything she had to ask Mariana for it, who discounted the cost of the item from the money she made. Regarding the fees, she said that they charged between eighty and one hundred pesos for one “pass” of half an hour, that the prices were higher if the women were to leave the premises with the customers, and that the price of the “drink” was between thirty and fifty pesos. She also referred to a system of fines –of fifty pesos- imposed by Mariana, for whenever a girl exited the premises, left the room dirty after a “pass” or talked on her phone while at the brothel. S.C.R.D, stated that she had arrived at the brothel on the 3rd of Debember 2009, to work in “passes” and “drinks”. She said that she had been there before, when she was 17 years old (April 2006). On that occasion, a man had offered her to come to Buenos Aires to work at a bar, he had asked her to bring a friend and had promised her she would make a lot of money. This man sent here to Foz de Iguazú, where a woman who knew them by name approached her, bought them tickets with destination “Retiro” and asked them to say they were going to visit a relative in the event of being asked at the border. Once they arrived in Retiro, someone told this woman that they couldn’t “get the girl” because she was a minor, and that for this reason they took her to Miss “Kity”, who said that she didn’t mind her being a minor because she needed girls. When she arrived at Pergamino, Miss “Kity” and her son in law were waiting for her at the bus station, and Mariana gave “a lot of money” to the woman who had brought them there. After this, she told them: “you girls better get working because you were very expensive”. She said that a man called Eduardo told them about the conditions of the job (they would earn the 50% of the “passes” and “drinks”) and what they had to do. However, they never paid him, for the first three months, she was not allowed to call Paraguay, and her documentation was withheld by the defendants. She finally managed to escape through a window. She stated that she ate once a day, and that the food was discounted –as was everything else she might have needed- from what she earned working there. She recounted how she once told Mariana that she wanted to go home to Paraguay, and that Mariana told her that she could not leave until she paid off her debt. She also explained that she went back to “Kity’s” because her partner (with whom she has a son) was out of work, and that he never got to discuss the conditions of her employment at that establishment because the raid was carried out just one day after she arrived.",trafficking in persons,1
"During the month of October 2008, the defendants were caught by the police while they were transferring a minor from the city of Formosa to the city of Cordoba, who they convinced to work as waitress in a brothel. According to the victim, they had offered her 1,500 Argentinean pesos (equivalent to 315 USD) and a false identity document.It was found during the investigation phase that the defendants recruited several other minors to work at the brothel. The procedure used by the defendants was to go through the neighborhoods of city of Formosa recruiting girls to work at the establishment.The victims, previously recruited, used to arrive at the place of work already in debt with them; they were obliged to pay back their travel costs and personal expenses.",trafficking in persons,0
"SO saw an ad in the newspaper offering employment in a supermarket and hotel in Rafaela, Argentina. SO called the number in the ad and spoke with a man named “M” who said he was Bolivian. They arranged an interview  and M asked for twenty Bolivian pesos in order to mail the SO’s resume to Rafaela, Argentina. M then wrote SO a receipt and gave him a copy of the contract. Later they agreed to meet in front of the Argentinean embassy in Bolivia. There were about 20 other people and M. gave them a contract of employment under the name CSA Corporation. The contract specified it was represented legally by the engineer MT. Subsequently, SO was unable to contact M so he called the phone number on the contract and spoke with a person who identified himself as MT who represented himself as responsible for the corporation. SO explained the situation and T told him that in Rafaela there was plenty of work and that it would be necessary for SO to travel there immediately. SO left Bolivia and arrived in Rafaela, Argentina two days later and walked towards the corporation. When he showed Ms. A. (an employee of the corporation) the contract, Ms. A. told him the contract was false and that they had nothing to do with that signature. SO called MT who then told him to walk to Avenue P.

SO then went back to the Corporation and Ms. A called the police and told them what happened. The police told SO to go back and spend the night at Avenue P. Cerdan and try to obtain more information regarding whether there were other people working for this man and in what conditions they were working. SO spent the night with three other persons who were sleeping on a foam mattress on the floor, who had also arrived from Bolivia a few days prior. They told him that they were only given bread and tea to eat, that they didn’t have any money, that they had not been told how much money they would be paid, and that they knew there were other Bolivian citizens working in the same conditions in Rafaela. The police raided the home in Avenue P.

"This case originated on the 19th of May of 2009, after the Argentinean Federal Police received an anonymous call made by a female caller, who informed about a cabaret near the town of Riestra, where Paraguayan and Dominican minors were working against their will.The Office of the Prosecution assigned the investigation to the Human Trafficking Division of the Argentinean Federal Police. This investigation included activities such as enquiries on the ownership of several vehicles, local licenses, undercover operations at the suspected premises, wire tapping, collection of the testimonies of the victims, etc.As a result the police was able to establish the existence of a group of people, who they identified as O. H. Di S., R. R. C., J. O. C., M. S. De V., J. C., S. C. G., a male known as “A.” and others, who, according to the investigators, acted in an organized manner, to recruit, transport, and transfer adult women from outside the country, to harbour them in Argentina and to sexually exploit them.The investigators concluded that the crime of human trafficking was being committed in three different locations: 1) at the cabaret “Tu X.”, operated by R. R. C., O. J. C., M.  S. De V. and O. H. Di S.; 2) at the cabaret “El X.”, located in the town of Salto, and managed by S. C. G. and A. P., currently a fugitive -the profits of which would also be perceived by the aforementioned De V., the C. brothers, Di S. and a person named Z. A. G.-; and 3) at the cabaret “Mi X.”, located in the town of Pehuajo, managed by the C. brothers and by De V., and in which O. H. Di S. also took part.The activity consisted in recruiting women, most of them in a position of vulnerability and of Paraguayan nationality, in order to take them to Argentina. The alleged traffickers would deceive the victims with false promises of employment, working as waitresses in bars. Once taken into the cabarets, they would be forced to do what is known as “drinks” and “passes”, which means drinking with customers and providing sexual services working as prostitutes. The earnings that the women generated with this work would be shared between the workers, who would receive a 50%, and the owners of these brothels, who would take the remaining 50%. The women were harboured at the brothels, where they had to stay at all times: they could only leave to send money to their families abroad. All the expenses the women generated, including the cost of the travel to Argentina, were discounted from the money they earned with the aforementioned “drinks” and “passes”. A system of fines and penalties was also in place, for those who did not want to perform such services or in case the women had any arguments.At the time of the search, at least 6 women of Paraguayan nationality required the assistance of the Office for the Rescue and Assistance of Persons Affected by Human Trafficking.According to the investigation, the defendants fulfilled different roles in the organization: at the establishment located in 25 de Mayo, R. was in charge of maintenance, F. would charge at the entrance and also sold drinks at the bar, while N.E.G. was the exclusive driver and the person responsible for transporting the women to the city centre, where they would send money to their countries of origin; R. was a receptionist with a certain level in the hierarchy of the business; J.C. provided the women with clothing and shoes, the price of which was directly discounted from their earnings; F. P. G. performed hair dressing duties and purchased personal items for the victims. At the “cabaret” in Pehuajo, R. and C. A. G. worked as barmen and were also in charge of collecting the money; F. L. D. G. (a.k.a. “M.”) worked as a barman and carried out maintenance tasks.",trafficking in persons,1

"After receiving a formal complaint about a case of sexual exploitation, the police in the city of Punta Alta conducted a raid at the bar Afrodita (Aphrodite) located in this city. In the place were two women from Paraguay who claimed to be victims of sexual exploitation. The prosecutor argued that the defendants recruited the victims by means of deception and transported them in September and November 2008 from the Republic of Paraguay to the city of Punta Alta in Argentina, and here were harboured to work as prostitutes in the locale mentioned above.The prosecutor stated that with the evidence offered and produced at the hearing of debate it has been established that all the defendants had set up a organization to sexually exploit the foreign women, who were eventually rescued, and that each of them took part, in one way or another, of the different steps required for this type of crime either recruiting, transporting, harbouring or receipting them, with the sole purpose of sexually exploiting them, taking advantage of the women’s vulnerable position. According to the prosecution, the defendants facilitated the victims a place to live, deceiving them about the real job they had to do, intimidating them, and ultimately affecting their dignity, sexuality and freedom of movement.The defendants denied the charges and in their defense claimed that the profits of the bar did not come from the prostitution of the women, but that the actual presence of women at the bar increased the clientele, and the women offered drinks to customers. Besides that, they claimed that any sexual relationship between the women and customers was their business and had to be conducted outside the bar. Also the defendants added that other Paraguayan and Brazilian women that worked at the bar were usually brought there by a friend who already worked or had worked at Afrodita.Some of the women who worked there said they were free, worked there by choice and never suffered any kind of abuse, while some others said they had no knowledge of any act of violence in the brothel. Because of the contradictory testimonies of the victims, the Court decided to declare the defendants not guilty.",trafficking in persons,1
"The case involved Internet gambling. A criminal group operated RAPOKER, which offered online games of chance and betting services without proper authorization. The criminal group had a pyramid structure. The members divided roles and responsibilities between them, and roles were based on the power of decision-making, the percentage of commission that they would charge, and the number of people they oversaw. The heads of the group, Raúl Daniel Marchisio and Iván Maciel Cicala, managed RAPOKER’s operations and ATM networks. Leonardo Maximiliano Perelli, another member of the group, was accountable to Raúl Daniel Marchisio and Iván Maciel Cicala. He created the “profeleopoker” ATM network, served as an organizer of Internet gambling services, and oversaw advertising through social networks and closing monthly-end balances, among other responsibilities. Paul Daniel Swistoniuk served as an operator in the group and an intermediary between “tellers” and “cashiers” in the group, informing them, for example, how to load credit and chips on panels when cashiers requested them and where to send money transfers when payments were made. He also resolved any issues of these group members as well as any issues of affiliates/players/users.    The government seized technological devices (cell phones, laptops, notebook computers, handheld game console, SIM cards, etc.) and accessories (e.g., headphones, speakers, and keyboards), ARS, USD, vehicles, and clothing, accessories, with printed logos and advertisements, among other items related to RAPOKER and associated activities.    Three defendants, namely Marchisio, Cicala and Perelli, received three years’ imprisonment and a fine of ARS 45,000.

"This case involved a criminal group that committed ATM jackpotting, a cybercrime that exploits both physical and software ATM vulnerabilities to make the ATMs dispense cash. The group targeted ATMs in remote physical locations without security guards. Their method of operation was to travel to banks to obtain physical access to the ATMs by forcing the front door of the ATM with a screwdriver, accessing the interior of the central processing unit (CPU), disconnecting the USB cable that connects the ATM CPU to its peripherals, including the bill dispenser, and replacing it with their own cable and connecting it to a laptop. They used specialized software to alter the functioning of the ATM and to dispense cash.   The group included five named individuals, the two defendants (Lisett Dayana Francis Jameson and Saddam José Caruso Sotillo) and three associates, Julio César Caruso Sotillo, Ruditt José Martínez Pinango, and Luis Abrahán Dos Santos Cantillo. Other unnamed individuals were also involved in the cybercrime. The group divided its roles among members. Some members were involved in the physical access to the ATM and the collection of the money while others engaged in surveillance or other essential tasks to the completion of the cybercrime. They obtained ARS 871,900 from the Bank of the Province of Cordoba ATMs they targeted.  The defendants were charged and convicted for criminal association and co-author and participant in fraud by computer manipulation. For her crimes and cybercrimes, Lisett Dayana Francis Jameson received three years and three months’ imprisonment for her crimes. Saddam José Caruso Sotillo received four years and three months’ for the crimes in relation to the present case. The court unified this sanction with another sentence and ordered a single sentence of six year’s imprisonment.

"The current case initiated as two separate, independent investigations before the local and federal law enforcement forces of the city of Neuquén. When the connection between both inquiries was detected, they were merged into one single case. As a result of the aforementioned investigations, the Court was able to establish the existence of an organization dedicated to the recruitment of Dominican women through deception, and their transportation to Mar del Plata, Argentina, with the purpose of subjecting them to sexual exploitation.The Dominican citizen D.D.M., was recruited and transported by R.A.A.C. The victim and R.A.A.C. left Santo Domingo on the 1st of February of 2010, and travelled to Lima, Peru by airplane. They later crossed the border crossing of Villazón-La Quiaca by foot, and arrived in Mar del Plata, Argentina, on February 5. Taking advantage of D.D.M.’s vulnerability, and with the false promise of a job at a shampoo factory or at a restaurant, which would help D.D.M. overcome her difficult economic situation, R.A.A.C. recruited the victim and transported her to the venue known as “D” in Mar del Plata.However, once she discovered the deception and the true activity she would be subjected to, D.D.M. suffered a nervous breakdown. Due to her emotional breakdown, on the following day C.C.C. asked R.A.A.C. to take D.D.M. away from their establishment. Finding herself in that situation, in an unfamiliar  city and without the necessary money to go back to her country, the victim was forced to go with R.A.A.C. to two similar night venues, where she was subjected to sexual exploitation. Finally, D.D.M. was able to escape this exploitative situation thanks to the assistance provided by residents of Neuquén, which allowed her to denounce the situation before the Fedetal Prosecutor.Similarly, the Court considered that it had been fully proven by the many testimonies received during the course of the trial, as well as by the body of evidence incorporated, that D.M.J.T. and J.C.Z. had been recruited and transported from the Dominican Republic to Mar del Plata. The victims were lured with a sham job offer and deceived through the abuse of their position of vulnerability. The victims were harboured in the dwelling located in Sal Salvador Street in Mar del plata. The defendants used coercive mechanisms, including penalties or fines, as well as the fabrication of financial debts, with the purpose of submitting them to sexual exploitation. This situation continued at least from the 28-06-2008, until the  19-04-2010, when the federal local law enforcement forces carried out a raid on the premises. On that occasion, law enforcement were able to verify the presence of several citizens from Dominican Republic – M.M.S., Y.A.A., S.U.R., and J.I.E.U. inside the establishment. These women were living in appalling sanitation and overcrowding conditions, and were also being subjected to exploitation.The investigation regarding these acts initiated as a response to the complaint filed by D.M.J.T. before the Human Trafficking Delegation of the Federal Police on the 11th of March of 2010, after managing to escape with the help of a third person, and running  away to the city of Buenos Aires.The victim reported that she had been recruited in the Dominican Republic together with nine other women, by a man named “T.”, who offered her the possibility of travelling to Spain, with the promise of obtaining a visa for her. The victim gave this man the deed to her house in the Dominican Republic, as a collateral to guarantee the payment for the travel arrangements. However, once the victim arrived at the airport of Santo Domingo to travel to Spain, this man told them that they would have to pass through Argentina first, as the visas were more easily obtained in Argentina. Once in Argentina, the victims were received and transported by a man called “J.”, and stayed at his personal domicile for ten days. She was then transported to a nightclub called “D.”. Once at “D.”, J. brought a few suitcases filled with underwear and lingerie, and told the women that there had been complications with the processing of the visas, and that they would have to work at the bar and prostitute theselves. He threatened the victims and told them that if they didn’t comply, they would lose their houses in the Dominican Republic.From that moment onwards, the victims were entrapped in the nightlub, and they were not allowed to leave the premises under any circumstances. The victims were forced to engage in prostitution and to live in the same rooms in which they provided sexual services. In her testimony, D.M.J.T. mentioned a man called “F.”, who was J.’s son, and was the person in charge of the club. “F.” was responsible of charging customers for the sexual services performed and for the drinks consumed. He also fined the women and imposed penalties if a client complained for any reason, and charged the victims 400 pesos to pay off the police, and 300 pesos to pay for food and other expenses. The victim never received any money, because according to J., she had to repay the debt generated by her travel arrangements, to pay for the costs of her stay at the nightclub, and for the promised trip to Spain. After being in this situation for three months, the victim was able to escape with the help of a customer.As to J.C.Z., she was recruited by her aunt, O.V.M. and her husband, J.S in June of 2008, with the promise of a job at O.V.M.’s beauty salon. However, upon arrival to Argentina, she found out the real nature of the activity she would be subjected to. J.C.Z. recounted the psychological abuse she suffered, as well as the coactive environment in which they lived, subject to constant violent threats, and even death threats. She also explained that the defendants simulated a supportive and prosperous environment, and forced the victims to record videos sending regards to their families, and to have their pictures taken at O.V.M.’s beauty salon, to convince their families that they were happy and working at that place.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"On the 13th April 2011, the 1st Police Precinct of Chajarí received an anonymous call informing about the situation of two women who were were being forced to stay in a room at the Caribe II Hotel under threat, and who had been given narcotic drugs.Pursuant to this information, the police arrived at the scene and found two females –one of them was a minor- who told them that they had been taken to the hotel by a man known as “Tito” -defendant Cardozo- and that they were afraid because he had threatened them and said that they had to work for him “selling their bodies”. They also stated that they had been given drugs and alcohol by “Tito”.As this was happening, the younger of the two girls started receiving calls and text messages from “Tito” on her mobile phone, who said that he was going to pick them up at the hotel. When he arrived at the scene, he was intercepted by the police and identified as Sergio Raúl Cardozo.At the police station, the victims expanded on their testimonies and recounted how they had arrived at Chajarí on the 12th of April, and how they had been received at the bus station by Cardozo. The girls had travelled to Chajarí because one of them (the minor) knew Cardozo -with whom she had a relationship- and he had offered her a job. They stated that he had taken them to an apartment, where he locked them and left them to stay the night. Later on, Antonio Gabriel Nonino arrived at the dwelling, and told them that they could not leave the apartment until Cardozo was back.On the 13th of April, the defendants –Cardozo and Nonino- had taken the victims to a bar, where they were offered cocaine by “Tito”, which they all consumed. It was then that Cardozo told them that he wanted them to work for him engaging in prostitution, and that he would give them a percentage of the money they made. He then told them they could not stay at the apartment and took them to the Caribe II hotel, where they consumed marihuana, alcohol and cocaine, which was once again supplied by Cardozo. Before leaving the hotel, Cardozo told them that he was going to look for clients and that they couldn’t leave the room. The girls were frightened, and one of them contacted a friend through text messages and asked her to pick them up. This person called the police station to raise the alarm.",drug offences,1
"This case was initiated following an anonymous call to the Local Office of the Argentinean Federal Police. This call reported that minors were being prostituted and drugs were being sold at a bar in the city of Paraná.As a result of this call, the Federal Police launched an investigation in order to corroborate the information received. On a first stage of the investigation, the police enquiry established the existence and location of the bar, and the presence of young women at the premises. Some of these young women were presumably minors, and in fact a 15 and a 16 year old were once seen leaving the bar. On the second stage, the police found that drugs were being consumed, and that a woman (adult) was offering sexual services within the premises. In addition to this, five or six young women, presumably minors, were seen peeking in from the back of the bar. Finally, several neighbors stated that the bartender was selling drugs and that there were rooms in the back of the bar, which were used by the women to engage in prostitution.Following these findings, a search of the bar was executed by the Argentinean Federal Police with the assistance of the Office for the Rescue and Support of Persons Affected by the Crime of Human Trafficking. Once inside the premises, the presence of nine women (adults and minors) and of four men was confirmed. The police proceeded to identify the women, among whom two were minors: G.A.N. and D.B.P.V. According to the testimonies of the relatives of the victims, the trafficker took advantage of the position of vulnerability of the victims, who were addicted to drugs, in order to exploit them sexually.",drug offences,1
"The case involves an individual associated with the NetWalker organized criminal group, which was responsible for providing ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). Their RaaS model involved developers (i.e., individuals who develop, update, and make the ransomware available) and affiliates (i.e., individuals who rent the ransomware, identify targets, and deploy ransomware). The NetWalker RaaS offered affiliates the ability to rent access to the ransomware in exchange for a portion of the proceeds obtained from extorting targets. The ransomware targeted emergency services, law enforcement, healthcare institutions, educational institutions, and commercial institutions.In 2021, the defendant, Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, was arrested and detained in Canada pursuant to an extradition order by the United States of America. The defendant was not ‘surrender[ed] to the U.S. …because he had outstanding drug trafficking charges in Quebec,’ which “were resolved on 21 January 2022,’ when he ‘was sentenced to 54 months’ imprisonment for five drug trafficking and related charges and possession of property obtained by crime’. Regarding his involvement in the NetWalker RaaS, on 1 February 2022, he pleaded guilty to mischief in relation to computer data, unauthorized use of a computer, extortion, and participation in the activities of a criminal organization. For these crimes, he was sentenced to serve 6 years and 8 months’ imprisonment. The defendant was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of CAD 2,805,829.97 and forfeit cryptocurrencies and CAD from accounts and safe deposit boxes in Canada. Having participated in designated offences (i.e., “extortion and participation in the activities of a criminal organization”) for which DNA is ordered for collection and storage in the DNA databank, the defendant was also ordered to provide a DNA sample for inclusion in the databank.",cybercrime,0
"This case involves six defendants who were all charged with some or multiple forms of organized crime offences in addition to other serious criminal offences. Three of the defendants, namely Mr Kalonji, Mr Henry and Ms Galbraith, were charged and convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud. Mr Kalonji, with two other men, was running a criminal organization whose main activity was committing account take over frauds. To accomplish this fraud, group members would open new accounts (so-called complicit accounts) or joint accounts that were in some way linked to victim accounts (often identified by hackers that gained illegal access to bank systems or by insiders of the bank). Money was then transferred from the victims’ accounts to the joint or complicit accounts and subsequently withdrawn from the accounts by associates. Intercepted communications of one of the defendants, Mr Kalonji, revealed that he used hackers to identify victim accounts and manipulate bank accounts for fraudulent reasons (e.g., transfer money from victim to complicit accounts).",cybercrime,0
"The defendant, Philip Michael Chicoine, lured children to commit sexual assault and produce child sexual absue material.He had in his possession child sexual abuse material (over 4,132 unique images and 582 videos of child sexual abuse), and created, accessed, shared and/or otherwise distributed child sexual abuse material online, using Skype, Viber, Kik messenger, Yahoo Messenger, Free Tone, Text Free, and peer to peer sharing platforms.The defendant used Skype to communicate with child sex offenders located in Romania and the Philippines and paid these individuals to sexually abuse female children between the ages of four and nine, directing the offenders as to what specific type of sexual abuse he wanted to see. The child sexual abuse was either pre-recorded or livestreamed. The defendant also directly communicated with children through a Viber account and sexually exploited them, sending them sexualized and graphic images, including images of his penis, offering them money in exchange for images of their vaginas, and directing the child victims to pass the defendant’s Viber account to other young girls. The exact number of the defendant’s victims is unknown. The defendant pleaded guilty to over 40 child sexual abuse and exploitation-related offences, including conspiracy charges relating to creating child sexual abuse material.  He was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment for his offending and was required to register as a sex offender for life (pursuant to the Sex Offender Information and Registration Act). The defendant was also prohibited from using the Internet or any other digital network to access content that violates the law, communicate with a minor, or “directly or indirectly access any social media sites, social network, Internet discussion forum or chatroom, or maintain a personal profile on any such service.” Furthermore, he was required to pay “[CAD] 200.00 victim fine surcharge imposed for each of the 40 counts to which Mr. Chicoine has pleaded guilty, for a total of [CAD] 8,000.00.”",cybercrime,1
"This case involves 176 films which the prosecution alleged were child pornography and which were sold, distributed imported and exported worldwide through Azov films incorporated by Mr. Brian Way.  Way claimed these videos and photographs were nudist films of young boys at play and are not child pornography. He argued there were no sexual acts depicted in these films. The main question to be answered was whether such material constituted child pornography for the purposes of the Canadian Criminal Code (Section  163.1 (1) (ii)  of which provides child pornography material qualifies as such where the dominant characteristic of the material is the depiction of sexual organs and/or anal regions of children under 18, for a sexual purpose).",cybercrime,1
"On June 22, 2010, the MV British Serenity arrived at the dock at Come By Chance, Newfoundland and Labrador. That vessel is a tanker and was delivering a cargo of crude oil to the refinery at Come By Chance. Prior to arrival of the vessel the Customs Act, R.S.C.1985, c.1 (2nd Supp) required that certain information be provided to the government of Canada. This included all relevant information about the vessel, its cargo and its crew. Further, all crew members were required to provide a truthful declaration to Canada Customs as to any goods, legal or illegal, which they were bringing into Canada. The accused made a declaration to Canada Customs and did not report that he had items of child pornography in his possession. He did, however, declare that he had a laptop computer in his possession.Canada Border Services administration, pursuant to the Act, instructed its staff of Border Services Officers (BSOs) to conduct an inspection and general search of the MV British Serenity and its crew for contraband. Pursuant to same, Officers Paul Smith and Fergus Murphy went on board of the vessel when it was docked at Come By Chance. They obtained a crew list from the captain of the vessel and accompanied by the Chief Mate (First Officer) began to randomly inspect the crew cabins on the vessel. They knew from the crew list who occupied each cabin. The accused's cabin was the second one inspected. It is not clear from the evidence if the accused’s cabin was locked. However, entrance was gained by the BSOs either by the Chief Mate unlocking the door and allowing them entry or they merely entered the unlocked cabin. The BSOs in accordance with the usual inspection procedure permitted under the Act, did not ask permission of the accused if they could enter his cabin and the accused did not know of the entry. Upon entering the cabin the officers observed a laptop computer on a desk. The computer was on, but was in screen saver mode. Officer Smith moved the mouse to open the computer. No programs were running. Officer Smith then began to inspect the computer to determine if it contained any images or videos of a prohibited nature. On checking the search feature of the computer he discovered an attachment with an external link under the name ""porno"". He believed that this was a file that contained pornography but he was unable to open it. Officer Smith decided to inspect the contents of the computer to determine whether it contained child pornography under the file named ""porno"". In order to conduct his inspection, Officer Smith requested that he be provided with the external link connected to the file named ""porno"". Officer Smith testified that it was common to find pornographic material on vessels. He testified that the discovery of this named file was an indicator that required further inspection and a more progressive search. Officer Smith acknowledged that at that point he had no grounds to arrest the accused. The officers could not find the external drive in the cabin so the Chief Mate, at the request of the officers, called the accused to the scene. The accused was on duty on deck. The accused attended at his cabin and Officer Smith spoke to him. Officer Smith believed that the accused had sufficient knowledge of English to understand what he was saying to him. He questioned the accused as to whether he had an external hard drive and a he replied, “No.” Officer Smith then showed the accused the computer and referred to the file named ""porno"" and the external attachment that showed thereon. The accused then said, “Yes” and walked out of the cabin to a storage room/cable locker located approximately 30 feet from his cabin. This storage room was an area that could have been inspected/searched by the officers in the routine inspection process. From a ledge above the door, where it appeared to have been hidden, the accused retrieved a 4 GB memory stick/USB Thumb drive. He returned to his cabin and handed the USB drive to Officer Smith. Officer Smith then inspected the USB drive and discovered therein a video file which he believed was child pornography. At that point the officers stopped their inspection and commenced an investigation. The accused was detained and arrested at 12:55. The officers gave the accused his Charter Rights, police caution and his Vienna Convention rights (his right to contact his embassy or consulate). Officer Smith testified that he 'made sure' that the accused understood everything and asked the accused if he wanted a representative on board the vessel to help him understand. The accused replied that he wanted the First Officer present. The First Officer was, in fact, at that time in the corridor outside of the accused's cabin. The First Officer then informed the accused of his Charter Rights, police caution and his Vienna Convention rights in the same manner as the officers but in 'easier language' to ensure that the accused fully understood. The accused then informed the officers that he understood. After that, Officer Smith had no concerns as to the accused fully understanding his Charter rights, police caution and Vienna Convention rights.",cybercrime,0
"In 2010, Mr Burnett, a Sergent from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), stole 10 kilograms of cocaine seized from a previous investigation from the RCMP exhibit vault. Mr. Burnett then brought the cocaine to Mr. Rowlings. Mr. Rowlings, with the help of Mr. Kanasevitch, packed the cocaine in bags in order to sell them. Mr. Kanasevitch sold the cocaine to several buyers.It is estimated that the sale of cocaine brought approximately CAD 300,000 to the group, divided equally between the three members of the group. Mr. Burnett used his share of the proceeds to buy a motorcycle. Mr. Kanasevitch stored CAD 40,000 of his share at Mr. Rowlings' house, who later used it to purchase a building.In 2016, as Mr. Kanasevitch could not get back his share from Mr. Rowlings, he decided to contact a police officer to inform him of the fact that Mr. Burnett had stolen cocaine and trafficked it with the help of Mr. Rowlings.When Mr. Burnett learned about the investigation, he asked Mr. Rowlings to cooperate with him in order to avoid suspicion and to lie in his interview with the police.",money laundry,1
"The two defendants in this case, Giuseppe Ursino and Cosmin Dracea, both located in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada, were co-conspirators in a scheme to import cocaine into, and traffic cocaine within, Canada from Jamaica, Costa Rica, and Dominican Republic. Ursino was alleged to be a ""boss"" within the global criminal organization known as the ‘Ndrangheta, based in Calabria, Italy. An undercover investigation was conducted between 7 May 2014 and 27 May 2015 with the use of an undercover police agent that had formerly been a career criminal. As part of his agreement with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, he was enrolled in a witness protection programme. During the investigation, the police agent arranged to meet with the defendants to discuss methods of cocaine importation into Canada. At these meetings both of the defendants were recorded using audio and video surveillance, which was later used as evidence to convict both of drug related offences, participation in an organized criminal group, as well as possession of proceeds of crime offences. The investigation was concluded in June 2015 with the arrest of the defendants. Both of the defendants were convicted in 2018 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, in Toronto, Ontario, and sentenced on 28 February 2019.The conspiracy charges of the defendants in this case related to a conspiracy involving one Richard Avanes. In separate proceedings (R v Avanes, 2015 ONCJ 606), Avanes pleaded guilty to conspiring with Cosmin Dracea, Giuseppe Ursino and others to import cocaine to Canada between 1 April 2015 and 23 May 2015 as well as importing 53.5 kilograms of cocaine into Canada on or about 25 August 2013.

Around the same time, the Royal Bank of Canada reported a suspicious transaction implicating Serge Perron.Subsequent police investigations, which continued from July 2006 to March 2008, uncovered a comprehensive cigarette contraband scheme and associated money laundering activities.Under this scheme, contraband cigarettes in standard cases were delivered from a wide variety of suppliers to a residential house in a suburb of Montreal, before being re-packaged in large cardboard boxes and transported to a refrigerated trailer-truck in Montreal, which then continued on to Nova Scotia where the cigarettes were then distributed for sale. The proceeds of the sales were returned to Montreal though various means (such as soap boxes delivered by Canada Post) before being laundering, in part, using ATMs.Charges were brought against a total of 20 individuals in five different cases corresponding to different criminal activities. The case at hand concerns criminal activity linked to tobacco contraband.",money laundry,1
"Jioh Park was a foreign national residing in Canada. She first came to Canada on a study permit in February 2002. In November 2008 she made a refugee claim. During the admissibility proceedings, she was alleged by the Minister of Public Safety (the Minister) to have engaged in money laundering. In particular, the Minister alleged that Ms. Park received and used in Canada the proceeds of a crime committed by her mother in Korea, namely CAD 700,000.00 worth of travellers' cheques plus USD 700,000.00 worth of travellers' cheques as well as approximately USD 200,000.00 in cash that was given to Ms. Park by her mother in a briefcase in August 2004 and later used by Ms. Park to purchase a condominium in Vancouver in her own name. The Minister, hence, claimed that Ms. Park was a party to her mother’s money laundering conduct.At the time of the allegation, Ms. Park’s mother, Soo Nam Cho, had been charged with the criminal offence of fraud in Korea and was currently being tried.The allegations against Ms. Park were used to exclude her claim for refugee status in Canada, pursuant to section 37(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.

"The victim is a 15 years old girl, who used to live in Stratford, Canada with her parents. Given her struggle with a crystal methamphetamine addiction, and resulting conflicts with her mother, she decided to run away from home. The victim went to her friend’s home in Seaforth and stayed with him and his grandmother. Her friend was already in contact with the second defendant Alexis-McLymont through social media, who used to live in Toronto and who asked him to join the ‘Cash Gang’ and help him recruit young females to engage in prostitution in return for a significant amount of money. Consequently, the Seaforth friend agreed to do so and introduced him to the victim, who did not understand the nature of the work that the defendant was offering her. After several contact between the victim and Alexis-McLymont, they agreed to meet and the victim was transferred to a hotel in Kitchener, where she met the other two defendants Dylan Hird and Anthony Elgin, and a female prostitute. Upon their meeting, the victim was provided with crystal methamphetamine in return for providing sexual services to a stranger. Realizing the situation and the type of work that the defendants expected her to engage in, the victim refused and insisted on leaving the hotel. She was prevented from doing so and threatened with violence by the first and third defendant. For more than a week, the victim was forced to provide sexual services to men in exchange for money and to sell drugs, while defendants kept all financial benefits. Furthermore, the accused took several revealing photographs of the victim and placed them on the internet to advertise her services. The victim was also sexually assaulted by both the second and third defendant. During that period, the victim was provided with no food, no toiletries and her cellular telephone was taken away from her. When required to meet a client outside of the hotel, the victim was able to escape and hide in a nearby store, where she called the police, who then rescued her.",other crimes,1
"Date(s) of offending: on/from 4 May 2006 to 31 January 2011The defendant was accused of organizing or attempting to organize, between 4 May 2006 and 31 January 2011, the coming to Canada of ten or more Somali migrants (potential refugees). In the endeavour of pursuing this venture, the defendant was deemed to have fraudulently obtained documentation from the Citizenship and Immigration Services of Canada.The defendant knew some of the irregular migrants he assisted, such as family members, friends, or family or friends of persons he knew. Conversely, many of them were not personally known to the defendant. Yet, the defendant maintained he had acted in view of the serious dangers faced by these migrants in Somalia, a reality he was well aware of in view of his own experience. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, notably declarations from (i) defendant, (ii) migrants (iii) refugees referred as sponsors in claims for refugee status of other individuals, (iv) competent governmental staff dealing with the processing of refugee claims, (v) employer of the defendant, (vi) staff from the banks where the defendant had his savings. Importantly, the outcome of searches and seizures to the residence of the defendant allowed retrieving relevant documental evidence, including – but not only - bank statements with regard to trust funds being held in support of the refugees’ applications. Many of these had no letterhead; others had no signature. Others instead had fields left blank. Some of the trust account numbers were repeated on more than one document. There were numerous copies of the same document. There were over 20 documents where the same bank account number was being used. Some documents appeared to have liquid paper markings. The same pay statement was made out to different persons. In some cases, it was clear that the name has been cut and pasted over another name. In other cases, the pay dates had been changed using the cut and paste method. Likewise, there were documents in which the dates and names had been altered. There were 17 examples of paystubs in the amount of $893.05. The defendant’s computer was seized.The defendant was placed under surveillance. So-called ‘garbage-pulls’ were also carried out. Regarding the specifics of the activities of the defendant in the alleged smuggling venture, the following aspects are to be highlighted: In Canada, there are three procedures to make refugee claims. That is,  (i) inland refugee claims, for persons who request refugee status when they are already in the country; (ii) privately sponsored claims: (a) sponsorship Agreement Holder program primarily used by churches, and (b) Group of Five sponsorship program (”G5”) where five or more persons sponsor one or more applicant refugee(s).The main components of the G5 program include the identification of a refugee or group of refugees and a group of no less than five sponsors who commit to support the refugees for a period of one year. Each of the sponsors is required to sign an undertaking for a one-year period to provide food, shelter and clothing and to help the refugee family settle in Canada. This requires more than just providing financial support. Each member of the G5 has to be eligible to sponsor by being a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident. The settlement plan is a key document, spelling out the sponsors’ obligations in broad strokes. There is a monetary baseline based on low income cut-off figures. Notably, $12,000 in financial support is required for the first person being sponsored and an extra $6,000 for each additional member. Supporting documentation can come from evidence of donations from each sponsor and their expected financial contributions. Members are expected to provide proof of income. In terms of finances, there needs to be a determination of how much it will cost to sponsor the family and how funds will be managed. Financial monitoring by the group is expected. Refugee families are not expected to work for one year as their ‘job’ is to get settled. Most new refugees do not have a passport and they are issued a single journey travel document, which is presented upon their entry into Canada.The defendant was one of the most prolific G5 sponsors. He contacted the office regularly. He had 20 to 40 applications in the queue. He regularly sought updates and guidance. He was very motivated to succeed. His settlement plans quickly improved. The processing time of his applications progressively decreased. He was happy that, as a consequence, his standing in the community heightened. At one point in time, he offered a gift to the Senior Program Officer with Canadian Immigration Canada (CIC) responsible for processing applications for the privately sponsored refugee program. The Senior Programme Officer refused. He understood that in some cultures this was expected. He did not consider this a bribe as the defendant was already getting what he wanted.In time, the said CIC Senior Programme Officer became concerned about the accused’s ability to support as many families as he proposed. Notably, he was aware the defendant was a janitor. Accordingly, he referred the processed (and approved) applications the defendant had sponsored to the Program and Integrity Division at headquarters. He came to appreciate that the defendant’s groups had pledged close to $1 million to support the refugee families. The CIC Senior Programme Officer did not advise the defendant of this referral to headquarters as he thought that the Canadian Border and Security Agency would be investigating, and did not want to interfere with the investigation.At different moments in time, alleged sponsors addressed the CIC office and claimed their names had been used on G5 applications in error and that they had not agreed to become sponsors. They added it was not their signature on the application. This information was referred to headquarters.As a result of investigations regarding the defendant, CIC decided that applications sponsored by him should be placed on hold until a decision had been reached.In interactions with CIC, the defendant described himself as the “go to” person within his community. He claimed that he had inherited a considerable amount of money from his father. He had bought a taxi plate, and made $1500 per month from the rental of that plate. He declared to have about 40 to 50 applications outstanding, and about 100 more applications stored in a box at his home. He was described by the concerned CIC staff as very friendly and passionate about what he was doing for his community. Later on, the defendant referred to CIC Senior Programme Officer that he had received from relatives $10,000 to buy gold in Dubai for resale at a profit in Canada. He would also have bought cars and construction materials in Dubai which he could resell in Somalia for a $10,000 profit. He told the CIC representative he had “lots of money” held in a bank account in Africa. He inquired if the CIC staff had a mortgage and said he could help her pay it off if she helped him. He told her he could cut her a deal on gold, but they would have to build trust and suggested that they have a meeting outside the office. He showed her his new vehicle and told her that he lived in a $400,000 home. Following other bribe insinuations and attempts, the defendant clearly offered to pay the CIC staff $ 550 for processed application, for which he would expected a turnover period of one week.In addition to the CIC Senior Programme Officer, the defendant also tried to bribe other employees working in the processing and approval of privately sponsored refugee claims, namely by offering jewellery.The defendant often asked his employer for reference and employment letters, which were delivered to him in the conviction that they were necessary for immigration purposes. The defendant asked several times that the letters stated he received remuneration higher than his real salary. The employer drafted a generic letter with no mention to financial compensation. The employer testified that, in two letters, the signature was not hers. In other instances, she did not recall at all issuing similar letters. She also referred to a number of irregularities in documents, such as reference letters and pay slips, that were strange to her. He worked in the concerned company as a janitor for three years (2004-2007).The competent representatives of the banks where the defendant had his accounts stated he often asked for letters attesting to the funds held. The employees always made sure the values referred were accurate. They testified not to recognise some bank statements or the signature in some of the afore-mentioned type of letters. They also noted a number of irregularities in letters allegedly issued by the bank. A number of accounts referred by the defendant in the applications he sponsored were inexistent. The corresponding certificates were not confirmed by the respective banks.The defendant used the names and personal data of refugees he knew as G5 sponsors, without their knowledge. In addition, many of the alleged sponsors appeared on more than one G5 application.Some asylum seekers testified to have paid (or to have been told they would have to pay) the defendant for his sponsorship. Values amounted to up $ 11 800. These fees would reportedly be to pay administrative fees related to the procedure and support refugees. Sometimes payments were made through the Hawala system; other, via wire transfer. Against this background, it is important to note that all migrants that entered Canada after being sponsored by the defendant did so with valid identity documents and following validation of applications by CIC.The defendant was arrested on 17 November 2011.All relevant evidence was translated from English into Somali. The defendant was assisted by an interpreter and provided evidence in Somali. Legal findings: The defendant was charged with eight counts under the Criminal Code and Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), including (i) migrant smuggling in its modality of facilitating illegal entry into Canada, (ii) corruption, (iii) fraud on government, (iv) forgery and related offences, (v) unlawful possession. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice acquitted the defendant of migrant smuggling and convicted him on the remaining charges. For further details see “Commentary”.",other crimes,0
"The accused in this case allegedly assisted in the planning of a robbery of a post office vehicle in Gdansk, Poland on 5 October 1999, that was carried out by an organized criminal group known as ‘Willy’s Group’.

"Five police officers, JOHN SCHERTZER, STEVEN CORREIA, JOSEPH MICHED, NEBOJSA MAODUS and RAYMOND POLLARD, have been charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and other substantive offences including obstruct justice, perjury and assault. In 1997, they coerced the drug dealer ANDREAS IOAKIM into contacting AIDA FAGUNDO to deliver 5 kilos of cocaine. After the delivery, the police officers attacked her and took her money and belongings. Ms Fagundo pled guilty to possession of cocaine and was sentenced in 1999 to 30 months in jail.The accuseds are suspected of obstructing justice by various means, including falsification of their memo books, preparing of police records that contain misleading or false information, preparation of false affidavits, perjury and failing to account for evidence seized. They also concealed the complaint for misconduct filed by Fagundo.The investigation of the offences began in 2001.The testimony of Fagundo was sought against the accused. For nine years, Fagundo traveled widely, to Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Spain, where she was residing when the pursuant order for her hearing by means of technology was issued. She refused to testify several times, fearing for her life (possible retaliation from Haitians or street gangs, or money still owing for the drugs she had delivered in 1997). On behalf of Canadian authorities, the cuban authorities interviewed her to see if she was willing to testify in Canada. She declined this offer, scared for her security, among other reasons.In 2008, pursuant to the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Treaty binding Spain and Canada, Canadian Prosecutors asked to conduct the interview of Fagundo in Spain. She refused on the ground that such a request would interfere with her application for a Spanish residency permit. The MLA request was then withdrawn by Canada.After several attempts to interview FAGUNDO, she finally agreed to testify under certain conditions, one of them being that she would not go to Canada to testify. As such, she accepted to be interviewed via video conferencing. The interview took place in May 2009 and was recorded.In granting the Prosecution their motion for video conferencing, the judge notes in this decision that a fair trial does not always require that an accused physically confront a witness in person. For the evidence to be admissible in court, the court, jury, counsel and accused must be able to see the witness on a screen and hear and see the witness testify in real time, and the witness has to be able to hear and see counsel questioning her, the registrar who administers the oath, and the court, in the event that the presiding judge must speak to her.",other crimes,0
"Ms T.C. was seventeen years old when she worked as an escort for Mr Tynes and Mr Lafferty in November and December 2009 and again for a few days in January 2010. Ms M.P. was also seventeen years old while she worked as an escort for the accused in January 2010. It was stated in the sentencing judgment that “neither accused used overt threats or violence to coerce T.C. and M.P. to work as escorts, but Mr Lafferty had a continuous intimate relationship with T.C. during the whole time she worked as an escort” [R v. Myles Tynes and Philip Lafferty [2010] Q.J. No. 13355 at 10]. The Honourable Pierre E. Labelle, J.C.Q. noted, however, that he was doubtful of the consent of Ms T.C. to engage in the relationship.His Honour stated that he accepted the testimony by the complainants that they had to “remit the entirety of the money made when working as escorts”.The accused would take the money and give the girls “room and board” in an apartment where at times other woman, presumably escorts, would stay and other members of the escort agency would sleep over to assure some supervision of the complainants [R v. Myles Tynes and Philip Lafferty, 2010 QCCQ 9767 at 57].The following additional case facts were summarized in the sentencing judgment [R v. Myles Tynes and Philip Lafferty [2010] Q.J. No. 13355 at 10]:- Both accused gave drugs to the complainants on a regular basis, but the evidence shows that they were consumed during parties at the apartment where they lived rather than as an inducement while working as escort;- A schedule was established and once in the motel room the complainants had no control over the number of clients they had to accept during any given night, nor was it established that they could refuse a particular client. The clients were dispatched by a telephone operator to the location of the escorts;- Even if they were equipped with cellular telephones, there was no immediate measure to protect the complainants whiles they were working. Fortunately, no incidents of violence were reported.The accused were charged separately on multiple counts of, inter alia, activities of procurement, living on the avails of prostitution, trafficking in persons and drug trafficking.",other crimes,1
"In December 2008, Mr Urizar met the complainant, who was 18 at the time, in a bar.  They started seeing each other. The accused was very nice to the complainant, buying her clothes and meals at restaurants. He convinced her into working as a stripper and to use drugs. She was physically, verbally, emotionally and sexually abused by him. The accused at one time locked her in a bedroom in an apartment and refused to let her go.",other crimes,1
"In June 2007, Ms K.C., a 19-year-old woman from Nova Scotia, was visiting family and friends on a vacation in Ontario with her boyfriend. The couple were staying with Ms K.C.’s aunt. Ms K.C. realized she had left her bag at her boyfriend’s cousin’s apartment and so went to retrieve it.Whilst at the apartment she was watching television when three men (Mr Thompson, Mr Downey, and Mr Roberts) came into the room. Mr Thompson told her “to get [her] shit together”, smacked her in the face and then Mr Roberts forced her downstairs into a car. From there she was driven to another apartment where she was told to go and shower. Following this Mr Thompson put a t-shirt over her head, tied her hands and feet together, and put a dirty sock in her mouth and tied a bandana around it (this is referred to in court documents as being “hog-tied”). She was then punched and kicked by Mr Thompson and Mr Downey. The men used a lighter to burn Ms K.C., leaving lasting scars all over her body. Mr Thompson also shoved a bottle into the victim’s vagina. Furthermore, Mr Roberts forced her to perform fellatio on him. Ms K.C. was then forced into a closet for the night, where she remained hog-tied.The following day the men continued to sexually assault and rape Ms K.C. She was put back into the closet until 7:30 that evening. At this point Mr Thompson asked her whether it was true a man (Mr F.C.) was her brother. After confirming that this was the case, the men untied her and apologized. She took a cab to her Aunt’s home at 10:30 that evening before returning to Nova Scotia. Once there she was taken to hospital where learned she was pregnant. She miscarried the baby two weeks later.Ms K.C. gave a statement to police and learned that her assailants believed that her boyfriend had stolen a car and safe belonging to one of the assailant’s brother and that they believed she was a party to the theft. She told police that at one point the men had told her that she was going to “be their prostitute and she would have no choice about it.”It was reported in the media that the men were known to be part of a Nova Scotia-based trafficking ring/gang known as “North Preston’s Finest”. It was alleged that the group is involved in moving young women from Nova Scotia to other provinces to work in the sex trade. Investigators reportedly believed that the group aimed to instil fear into Ms K.C. and force her into the sex trade.",other crimes,1
"Mr Vilutis targeted a young vulnerable woman who suffered from family issues, sexual abuse, and drug addiction. The victim, Ms T.C., was a teenage runaway who had prostituted herself in order to survive. She was recruited from an exotic dance club in the Greater Toronto Area where she was dancing, and her trafficker vouched that she could earn more money if she was advertised online through Craigslist. From the onset, Mr Vilutis took advantage of the victim’s insecurities and proceeded to develop a relationship with the victim. Under the pretence of saving money for a home together, Mr Vilutis coerced the victim to give him all her earnings. It was reported in the media she made CAD10,000 for Mr Vilutis within a few weeks of selling herself through Craigslist [Tamara Cherry, ‘Craigslist removes erotic services ads’, Toronto Sun (online), 18 December 2010, < http://www.endmoderndayslavery.ca/2011/01/06/craigslist-removes-erotic-services-ads/>]. Mr Vilutis exerted control over several aspects of the victim’s life. The victim had to adhere to a set of rules, which included restrictions on her movement. The accused also initiated a “fine system” for breaking rules whereby the victim was penalized for smoking in the room (CAD100 fine) and sleeping (CAD500) for instance.The victim was subjected to threats and physical assault by her trafficker in an attempt to maintain control over her. Mr Vilutis was arrested in October 2008 after Ms T.C. escaped from a Mississauga motel room and went to the police.",other crimes,1
"Ms Emerson forced three young women, two of whom were underage at the time of the offence, into prostitution. Some of the victims were lured into the vicinity of a women’s homeless shelter in the National Capital Region while some were recruited at an Ottawa courthouse, although no record of Ms Emerson working at the courthouse could be found. It was alleged that Ms Emerson received one of the three women in an exchange with another pimp. The victims were confined inside a Gatineau area condominium furnished only with a mattress and forced to prostitute. The victims were also transported to hotels and homes to service clients. The victims were subjected to physical abuse and threats and surrendered all their earnings. It has been reported that the women were expected to work eight to 10 hours a day and make CAD1000-2000, all of which went to Ms Emerson. Ms Emerson further exploited the victim’s drug and alcohol dependencies, making them smoke crack, to ensure their compliance. Two of the victims made a number of attempts to escape but were ultimately caught by Ms Emerson, beaten and then returned to the condominium. Following the arrest of Ms Emerson it was reported that she made threats against them in an attempt to prevent them testifying.",other crimes,1
"The defendant in this case was the leader of an organized criminal group involved in drug trafficking. He was accused of operating a drug ring out of a hotel bar in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. The drugs (heroin and cocaine) were supposedly transferred by couriers from off-site locations, such as hotels and motels rented by the defendant, to ‘stash rooms’ in the hotel, where they were then prepared and packaged for individual sale. The defendant hired employees to oversee the sales, and he personally maintained supervisory control of the organization through frequent telephone contact and personal attendance at the hotel. The alleged drug business centred on small quantity but high-volume sales, with about 10 sales of cocaine or heroin taking place per hour for about USD 10 per transaction. The indictment alleged that there was a total of 21 co-conspirators.The defendant was charged on a multi-count indictment under s 467.13 of the Canadian Criminal Code, RSC 1985 c C-46.Count 1 accused Mr Terezakis of being part of a ‘criminal organization whose members included… three or more…persons … between the 4th day of February, 2002 and the 7th day of August, 2003, at or near the Cities of Vancouver, Surrey, Coquitlam, Abbotsford and places elsewhere in the Province of British Columbia’. It was alleged that the Defendant ‘knowingly [instructed] directly or indirectly any person including any member of that criminal organization, to commit the indictable offences of trafficking in the controlled substances of cocaine and diacetylmorphine (heroin) contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act for the benefit of the said criminal organization contrary to section 467.13 of the Criminal Code of Canada’. The indictment also charged Mr Terezakis jointly or solely with various offences on 15 other counts, including conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and heroin, trafficking in cocaine and heroin, offences related to assault and unlawful confinement.",other crimes,1

"Organized Criminal Group Involved: The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club- General Modus Operandi: the facilitation or commission of serious criminal offences, likely resulting in the direct or indirect receipt of a material benefit, including a financial benefit, by the group or by any of the persons who constitute the group, whether in or outside of Canada- Types of Crime the Hells Angels Usually Engage In, include, inter alia, the following:(i) Trafficking in Illicit Drugs, primarily cocaine and other drugs;(ii) Trafficking in Firearms;(ii) Murder(iii) Attempt Murder(iv) Extortion(v) Money Laundering(vi) Illicit Gambling;(vii) Bombings(viii) Property Related offences- Characteristics of the Hell Angels as an Outlaw Motorcycle Club, both Nationally and Internationally, include, inter alia, the following:(i) Hierarchical Structure (such as physical corporate organizational lists)(ii) Membership (such as carrying cards and HA jewellery paraphernalia and a strict and lengthy probation term to become a full-patch member, from a hang-around, prospect and finally a member)(iii) Club Rules(iv) Colours (such as the Hells Angels patch, skull with wings)(v) Clubhouses(vi) Counter-Intelligence Gathering against the police (as is evidenced by the physical seizure of sensitive internal police documents seized from the Hells Angels’ Clubhouses and in the homes of full-patch members in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada(vii) Associates; and(viii) Criminal Activities(i) Factual Summary Of the Hells Angels as An Outlaw Motorcycle ClubThe Hells Angels are a highly-structured group which is deliberately organized to facilitate the commission of criminal offences by and among its members, in particular, the trafficking of drugs.Members of the Hells Angels belong to individual chapters or “Charters”, and must abide by the rules set by the Hells Angels. In Ontario, Hells Angels members are governed by world rules, Canada-wide rules, and Ontario rules. The rules create an environment within which Hells Angels members can carry out criminal activity free from detection by the police. For example, membership is tightly controlled, so that only trusted individuals with no connection to law enforcement can join. Potential members are carefully screened and only permitted to become “full-patch” members after first being a “Hangaround”, then a “Prospect”. In order to become a “Hangaround”, an individual must be systematically involved in crime. “Prospects” are actively involved in criminal activities and are on probation for a period of one to two years. The transition from “Hangaround” to “Prospect” status, and from “Prospect” status to “full-patch” member, can only occur if 100% of the members approve of the change. New members must be sponsored by a full-patch member and are under probation for one year. Photographs of members are distributed to all chapters in Canada to avoid infiltration by police undercover officers.Other rules facilitate the commission of crime by members of the Hells Angels. No person who has ever been in law enforcement, or who has ever taken steps to become a police officer or prison guard, is permitted to be a member. Members must abide by a strict “no snitching” rule, which prevents them from even reporting to the police that they have been a victim of crime at the hands of another. The Hells Angels also have a strict “no rips” rule, which helps to ensure that individuals can enter into drug-related business with members of the Hells Angels without fear of being the victim of a drug “rip-off”, and thereby enhances the ability of Hells Angels members to engage in drug-related activity.Individuals are not permitted to become members of the Hells Angels until they have demonstrated their loyalty and trustworthiness to the criminal organization. Once members, they are considered to be club “brothers” who will assist each other in criminal endeavours when called on.Members of the Hells Angels also know that if there is a dispute or conflict among members, other members will step in to mediate or arbitrate the dispute. Criminal activity conducted between members is not carried out in isolation from their membership in the Hells Angels; rather, members know that if a dispute arises, the Hells Angels will actively intervene and mediate the dispute.In addition to the rules and highly-structured organization of the Hells Angels which facilitate the commission of offences by club members, individual chapters of the Hells Angels operate secure, fortified clubhouses within which members can meet to engage in criminal activity.(ii) Factual and Legal Summary of the Instant Case, R. v. WagnerThe accused, Kenneth Wagner (“Wagner’), was a high-ranking, full-patch member of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club – Niagrara Chapter, a criminal organization notorious for facilitating the commission of criminal offences by its members. Wagner was a party to a number of cocaine transactions and a gun transaction with another full-patch member of the Hells Angels, Steven Gault (“Gault”), who also happened to be a police agent, who had been wired with a judicially authorized recording device. Although Wagner admitted to cocaine trafficking on several occasions in excess of 4 kilograms, he denied that he instructed others to commit the offence of trafficking in cocaine and transferring a firearm for the benefit of the criminal organization, the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club.As an executive member of the Hells Angels' Oshawa Chapter, Mr. Steven Gault became a police agent. In the summer of 2005, that agent, Steven Gault, contacted Mr. Gerald Ward who is the President of the Niagara Chapter of the Hells Angels. Gault spoke directly to Gerald Ward about purchasing a kilogram of cocaine from Ward. It was agreed that since the Oshawa Chapter owed a drug debt to Mr. Ward of the Niagara Chapter, that Mr. Gault would pay a premium of $2,000 on top of the cost of purchasing the kilogram of cocaine to work down the debt owed by the Oshawa Chapter by Mr. Ward of the Niagara Chapter.On August 18, 2005, Mr. Gault attended in Niagara and paid $42,000 directly to Mr. Ward. Ward then arrange to have Mr. Wagner, a full patch member of the Hells Angels, to arrange for the cocaine to be delivered by Hells Angels associates, prospects or hangarounds.In the first transaction, Mr. Wagner arranged to have a Mr. Muise deliver the drugs. This procedure was followed on four separate occasions.On October 5, 2005, Gault purchased from Ward a kilo of cocaine for $38,000. Mr. Wagner arranged to have a Mr. Lacroix and Mr. Muise deliver the drugs.Again on January 11, 2006, Mr. Ward sold the drugs for $38,000. Again, Ward got the money and Mr. Wagner was left to arrange delivery and he had Lacroix and Muise deliver the drugs on that date.In February of 2006, there was another kilogram transaction. Again Mr. Ward was the one receiving the money, Mr. Wagner arranged to have Mr. Beaulieu deliver the drugs and Mr. Wagner received the $400 in cash for the 48 calibre magnum handgun that was transferred. The other cash money for the cocaine went directly to Ward.The last transaction in drug trafficking took place on August 16, 2006, where 10 ounces of drugs were trafficked for the Harley Davidson motorcycle.In total the police agent purchased 4.38 kilograms of cocaine, that on average was 91 percent pure. He also purchased a handgun for $400 and the cocaine totalling $156,000 plus a Harley Davidson motorcycle.On all of these transactions, Mr. Ward was the person who set the price, discussed the deal and received the money. Wagner was the person who directed other prospect members and associates of the Hells Angels, namely Muise, Lacroix and Beaulieu, to commit the offences of actually delivering the drugs physically and the firearm to Mr. Gault.Based upon the wiretaps, the trial judge convicted Mr. Wagner under section 467.13 of the Criminal Code of Canada. The trial judge found the following:• Ward is the person who was in command. He is the one who made the arrangement and set the price. It is Mr. Wagner's involvement, he admits he is a full patch member of the Hells Angels who then made the necessary arrangements to have those drugs delivered.• that Mr. Wagner would be number two in the hierarchy of these various drug transactions, although he made a point of not touching the drugs but simply making the arrangements. As a full-patch member, he was insulated from those who actually had to carry out the delivery.• When the police arrested Mr. Wagner on September 28, 2006, he was found in possession of $150,675 in cash. He also has acknowledged that the truck he owned and the motorcycle were also proceeds of crime and he fairly has conceded that they should be forfeited to Her Majesty the Queen.• that these gun and drug transactions were not simply committed between individuals, but that Wagner instructed Muise, Beaulieu and Lacroix to traffic in these drugs and transfer the firearm for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with the Hells Angels, which the trial judge found to be a criminal organization.",other crimes,0

The weapons were seized along with cartridges found outside the clubhouse.

"This case involved an appeal, by the Crown, of the acquittal of three individuals who had been charged with organizing the illegal entry of people into Canada; specifically, 492 Sri Lankan nationals of Tamil ethnicity who, in 2010, arrived off the west coast of Canada aboard the MV Sun Sea, a cargo vessel designed for short coastal voyages.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The appellant was convicted under section 117 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,which prohibits organizing the illegal entry of people into Canada. He was found guilty at the trial level for his role in the arrival of the MV Sun Sea off the west coast of Canada, which carried 492 Tamil migrants. The appellant argued that the trial judge made the following errors:(1)  Treating the common law exceptions to the offence articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in R v Appulonappa as defences rather than elements of the offence;(2)  Preventing the humanitarian aid exception to be considered by the jury;(3)  Treating the family aid exception as a subset of the mutual aid exception;(4)  Interpreting the mutual aid exception as only being available where it was the accused’s sole motivation; and,(5)  Failing to find that the accused’s constitutional right to a trial within a reasonable time was violated.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal rejected all of the appellant’s grounds for appeal, except for those relating to the interpretation of the mutual aid exception. They ordered that the appellant be retried on this basis. On the first issue, and consistent with its decision in R v Rajaratnam, the Court held that the exceptions articulated by the Supreme court are not elements of the offence but rather operate as defences. In practical terms, this means that it is for the defence to either lead evidence or point to evidence tendered by the Crown to put the defence at issue. If there is an “air of reality” to the defence, the Crown has the burden to disprove the elements of the defence beyond a reasonable doubt. On the second issue, the Court agreed with the trial judge that the evidence did not establish an air of reality that the appellant was acting for a humanitarian purpose, meaning that no reasonable jury could find, based on the evidence, that humanitarian aid was provided. On the third issue, the Court held that although the trial judge should have treated the family aid defence as a separate defence, it had no impact on the outcome given that all but one of the 492 passengers on the MV Sun Sea were unrelated to the appellant. The Court did agree that the trial judge erred in its interpretation of the mutual aid defence in two ways: (1) by stating that the defence only applies where the accused’s sole motivation was to provide mutual aid; and, (2) by stating that the defence requires mutuality of assistance. On the final ground of appeal, the Court held that the appellant’s constitutional right to be tried within a reasonable time was not violated because the delay was due, in part, to an agreement by defence counsel to await the outcome of the R v Appulonappa case before the Supreme Court of Canada.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The case involves an immigration procedure brought against a Kosovar national of Albanian descent. The applicant was declared inadmissible under the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) on grounds of organized criminality for engaging in migrant smuggling. As a consequence, any previously held residence title was revoked against which the applicant filed for judicial review at the Federal Court in Toronto.In December 2011, a Colombian national began trying to find someone who could help him and his family, who were living in Canada but did not have status, to enter the United States. He was introduced to a man named “Amigo” who agreed to facilitate the smuggling of him, and the other five members of his extended family, into the United States, for CAD 15,000. Of this, CAD 5,000 was paid in advance as a deposit.On 26 January 2012, the six of them were picked up by the applicant in a black caravan in Kitchener, Ontario and were driven to the Canada/US border at Stanstead, Quebec. Next to the applicant two more men were already in the vehicle:  Amigo was sitting in the front passenger seat; and a third man (who was going to be crossing the border with them). A member of the group of six had CAD 10,000 CAD in $100 bills in a brown envelope to complete payment. In evidence, it was said that the envelope with the money was handed towards the front seats of the vehicle, to either Amigo or the applicant.When the group reached the area of the border crossing, everyone but the applicant got out of the vehicle. They were directed to walk through the woods. Amigo led the way. He was speaking on his cell phone with someone who was believed to be the person who would be picking them up on the U.S. side of the border. As they were walking, the others had difficulty keeping up with Amigo and eventually lost sight of him. Shortly afterwards, at about 8:00 p.m, the group was apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in a field just over the from Boulevard Notre-Dame Est in Stanstead. They never saw Amigo again.At about the same time, officers of Canada’s RCMP's Integrated Border Enforcement Team decided to stop the black Dodge Caravan the applicant was driving as it was leaving a gas station in Stanstead, based on information from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. When they searched the applicant, the officers found an envelope containing CAD 9,900 in $100 bills in his left side breast jacket pocket. The applicant admitted later that it originally contained CAD 10,000 but he had spent some money on gas and other items. After further questioning the applicant, the officers determined that they had grounds to arrest him for conspiring to smuggle migrants into the United States.The applicant was charged with conspiracy to commit an offence contrary to section 465(3) of the Criminal Code, RSC, 1985, c C-46. Eventually, on 8 June 2016, this charge was stayed by the Crown under section 579 of the Criminal Code. However, on that same date the applicant consented to the forfeiture of the cash seized from him on 26 January 2012 as proceeds of crime.On 7 September 2016, an Inland Enforcement Officer with the Canada Border Services Agency issued a report stating that the applicant was inadmissible to Canada under section 37(1)(b) of the IRPA on grounds of organized criminality for engaging, in the context of transnational crime, in migrant smuggling. The officer's opinion was based on information gathered with respect to events that had occurred on and leading up to 26 January 2012.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The Applicant, Hamalraj Handasamy, is a 45 year old citizen of Sri Lanka. He, along with 75 other individuals, arrived off the coast of British Columbia in October 2009 aboard the Motor Vessel Ocean Lady. Mr. Handasamy and all the other individuals on the ship made claims for refugee protection. However, his claim for protection failed because, after the Immigration Division [ID] of the Immigration and Refugee Board [IRB] determined on January 22, 2014 that Mr. Handasamy was inadmissible to Canada on the basis of his involvement in the smuggling of migrants, an immigration officer [the Officer] decided to issue a notice which terminated consideration of his claim for refugee protection. The Applicant left Sri Lanka for Malaysia in January 2007 due to problems with para-military groups connected to the Sri Lankan Security Forces. The Applicant had no legal status while in Malaysia, which is not a signatory to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, 189 UNTS 150. In February 2009, the Applicant’s employer informed him that there was a vessel travelling to Canada and that if he agreed to work as a crew member aboard the vessel he could journey to Canada. In exchange for his work, the Applicant would pay a reduced amount for his passage to Canada; he agreed to pay $20,000. In May 2009, the Applicant was transported from Malaysia to Indonesia and, on or about June 1, 2009 he boarded the Ocean Lady as the first passenger or crew member. The Applicant received instructions from two individuals with the titles of “Captain” and “First Engineer” on how to operate the ship’s engine and GPS navigational system. After a few weeks on board, these individuals informed the Applicant that another individual who was to navigate the ship to Canada was no longer coming to do so; they then imposed upon him and a few other crew members the responsibility for navigation of the ship. When the Applicant declined this additional responsibility, he was threatened and kicked by the Captain. He and three others took over navigation of the ship in August 2009 after the Captain and the First Engineer left the ship. As part of their duties to ensure the success of the voyage, the navigational team or crew were to call the organizers of the voyage several times a day by way of a pre-programmed satellite phone to inform them on the status of the ship and its operations, and also to receive instructions on what to do. The crew was alerted to the fact that the vessel would likely be intercepted by Canadian authorities, and that they were to sink the ship upon being intercepted. In late August 2009, the Ocean Lady set sail to Thailand where two boatloads of passengers joined the ship, and in early September 2009 they proceeded from Thailand towards Canada where all those aboard the ship intended to make refugee claims. The Applicant assisted in navigating the ship to Canada. He was aware that none of the individuals aboard the Ocean Lady had proper documentation to enter Canada. On October 15, 2009, two days before the ship arrived in Canadian waters off the coast of Vancouver Island, a Fisheries Canada plane made radio contact with one of the individuals on board who informed the agents in the plane that the ship contained 76 individuals who intended to make refugee claims in Canada. The agents in the plane instructed the ship to maintain its course to Canada. On the following day, a Canadian naval vessel made contact with the Ocean Lady and guided it into Canadian waters.Upon arrival in Canada, the Applicant initiated a claim for refugee protection as he originally intended. After numerous interviews with Canadian officials, the Applicant was reported as being inadmissible to Canada on grounds of organized criminality pursuant to paragraphs 37(1)(a) and 37(1)(b) of the IRPA. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration referred the inadmissibility reports to the ID for an admissibility hearing pursuant to subsection 44(2) of the IRPA.",smuggling of migrants,0
"B010, J.P., G.J., B306 and H (the “migrants”) were all found inadmissible to Canada under s. 37(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (“IRPA”) on the ground that they had been engaged in organized criminal smuggling. The result of being ruled inadmissible under s. 37(1)(b) is that the refugee claimant is peremptorily excluded from Canada without consideration of his or her claim on the merits. The migrants all say they were simply helping fellow asylum-seekers flee persecution, and were not engaged in people smuggling.H is a native of Cuba who was accepted as a refu­gee by the United States. Two years later, he purchased a boat with two others and used it to transport 48 Cubans to the United States without the knowledge of United States authorities. Convicted in the United States of alien smuggling and receiving a deportation order from the United States, he came to Canada and claimed refugee protection.B010, J.P., G.J., and B306 are among a group of nearly 500 Tamils from Sri Lanka who boarded the cargo ship Sun Sea in Thailand. The organizers of the voyage promised to transport them to Canada for sums ranging from $20,000 to $30,000 per person. Shortly after de­parture, the Thai crew abandoned the ship, leaving the asylum-seekers on board to their own devices. Twelve of the migrants took over various duties during the three-month voyage across the Pacific Ocean to Canada. The ship was dilapidated, unsafe and crowded. Food was in short supply and the fear of interception was constant. B010 worked two three-hour shifts in the engine room each day, monitoring the temperature, water and oil level of the equipment. J.P., who was accompanied by his wife G.J., stood lookout, read the GPS and radar, and acted as an assistant navigator during the voyage. B306 vol­unteered to act as a cook and lookout. He cooked three meals a day for the crew, and used a telescope to spot ap­proaching trawlers and notify the crew so that passengers could be hidden below deck to avoid interception.The Immigration and Refugee Board (“Board”) found the migrants inadmissible to Canada, on the basis that s. 37(1)(b) of the IRPA covers all acts of assistance to illegal migrants and does not require a profit motive. On judicial review to the Federal Court, B010’s appli­cation was rejected while the applications of J.P., G.J., B306 and H were allowed. The Federal Court of Appeal rejected B010’s appeal and in the remaining cases, the court allowed the appeals and reinstated the Board’s de­cisions of inadmissibility.",smuggling of migrants,1
"Date(s) of offending: 17 October 2009 The MV Ocean lady is a marine vessel that was apprehended on October 17, 2009 off the west coast of Vancouver Island, in British Columbia. It was carrying seventy-six Sri Lankan (Tamil) migrants who boarded the ship in Southeast Asia (Indonesia and Thailand) and who were seeking asylum (refugee status) in Canada claiming their lives were endangered in Sri Lanka following the civil war. None of the passengers had obtained the required legal documentation for entry into Canada (Para. 1, R. v. Appulonappa, 2015 SCC).

The four appellants, were charged under s. 117(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (“IRPA”), which defines the transnational offence of “organizing, inducing, aiding or abetting” the entry into Canada of persons without valid documentation in contravention of the Act (Para 3). A conviction for this offence may result in a lengthy sentence of (potentially life) imprisonment, a substantial fine, or both and/or disqualification from being considered for refugee status.",smuggling of migrants,0
"Date(s) of offending: on/from 4 May 2006 to 31 January 2011The defendant was accused of organizing or attempting to organize, between 4 May 2006 and 31 January 2011, the coming to Canada of ten or more Somali migrants (potential refugees). In the endeavour of pursuing this venture, the defendant was deemed to have fraudulently obtained documentation from the Citizenship and Immigration Services of Canada.The defendant knew some of the irregular migrants he assisted, such as family members, friends, or family or friends of persons he knew. Conversely, many of them were not personally known to the defendant. Yet, the defendant maintained he had acted in view of the serious dangers faced by these migrants in Somalia, a reality he was well aware of in view of his own experience. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, notably declarations from (i) defendant, (ii) migrants (iii) refugees referred as sponsors in claims for refugee status of other individuals, (iv) competent governmental staff dealing with the processing of refugee claims, (v) employer of the defendant, (vi) staff from the banks where the defendant had his savings. Importantly, the outcome of searches and seizures to the residence of the defendant allowed retrieving relevant documental evidence, including – but not only - bank statements with regard to trust funds being held in support of the refugees’ applications. Many of these had no letterhead; others had no signature. Others instead had fields left blank. Some of the trust account numbers were repeated on more than one document. There were numerous copies of the same document. There were over 20 documents where the same bank account number was being used. Some documents appeared to have liquid paper markings. The same pay statement was made out to different persons. In some cases, it was clear that the name has been cut and pasted over another name. In other cases, the pay dates had been changed using the cut and paste method. Likewise, there were documents in which the dates and names had been altered. There were 17 examples of paystubs in the amount of $893.05. The defendant’s computer was seized.The defendant was placed under surveillance. So-called ‘garbage-pulls’ were also carried out. Regarding the specifics of the activities of the defendant in the alleged smuggling venture, the following aspects are to be highlighted: In Canada, there are three procedures to make refugee claims. That is,  (i) inland refugee claims, for persons who request refugee status when they are already in the country; (ii) privately sponsored claims: (a) sponsorship Agreement Holder program primarily used by churches, and (b) Group of Five sponsorship program (”G5”) where five or more persons sponsor one or more applicant refugee(s).The main components of the G5 program include the identification of a refugee or group of refugees and a group of no less than five sponsors who commit to support the refugees for a period of one year. Each of the sponsors is required to sign an undertaking for a one-year period to provide food, shelter and clothing and to help the refugee family settle in Canada. This requires more than just providing financial support. Each member of the G5 has to be eligible to sponsor by being a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident. The settlement plan is a key document, spelling out the sponsors’ obligations in broad strokes. There is a monetary baseline based on low income cut-off figures. Notably, $12,000 in financial support is required for the first person being sponsored and an extra $6,000 for each additional member. Supporting documentation can come from evidence of donations from each sponsor and their expected financial contributions. Members are expected to provide proof of income. In terms of finances, there needs to be a determination of how much it will cost to sponsor the family and how funds will be managed. Financial monitoring by the group is expected. Refugee families are not expected to work for one year as their ‘job’ is to get settled. Most new refugees do not have a passport and they are issued a single journey travel document, which is presented upon their entry into Canada.The defendant was one of the most prolific G5 sponsors. He contacted the office regularly. He had 20 to 40 applications in the queue. He regularly sought updates and guidance. He was very motivated to succeed. His settlement plans quickly improved. The processing time of his applications progressively decreased. He was happy that, as a consequence, his standing in the community heightened. At one point in time, he offered a gift to the Senior Program Officer with Canadian Immigration Canada (CIC) responsible for processing applications for the privately sponsored refugee program. The Senior Programme Officer refused. He understood that in some cultures this was expected. He did not consider this a bribe as the defendant was already getting what he wanted.In time, the said CIC Senior Programme Officer became concerned about the accused’s ability to support as many families as he proposed. Notably, he was aware the defendant was a janitor. Accordingly, he referred the processed (and approved) applications the defendant had sponsored to the Program and Integrity Division at headquarters. He came to appreciate that the defendant’s groups had pledged close to $1 million to support the refugee families. The CIC Senior Programme Officer did not advise the defendant of this referral to headquarters as he thought that the Canadian Border and Security Agency would be investigating, and did not want to interfere with the investigation.At different moments in time, alleged sponsors addressed the CIC office and claimed their names had been used on G5 applications in error and that they had not agreed to become sponsors. They added it was not their signature on the application. This information was referred to headquarters.As a result of investigations regarding the defendant, CIC decided that applications sponsored by him should be placed on hold until a decision had been reached.In interactions with CIC, the defendant described himself as the “go to” person within his community. He claimed that he had inherited a considerable amount of money from his father. He had bought a taxi plate, and made $1500 per month from the rental of that plate. He declared to have about 40 to 50 applications outstanding, and about 100 more applications stored in a box at his home. He was described by the concerned CIC staff as very friendly and passionate about what he was doing for his community. Later on, the defendant referred to CIC Senior Programme Officer that he had received from relatives $10,000 to buy gold in Dubai for resale at a profit in Canada. He would also have bought cars and construction materials in Dubai which he could resell in Somalia for a $10,000 profit. He told the CIC representative he had “lots of money” held in a bank account in Africa. He inquired if the CIC staff had a mortgage and said he could help her pay it off if she helped him. He told her he could cut her a deal on gold, but they would have to build trust and suggested that they have a meeting outside the office. He showed her his new vehicle and told her that he lived in a $400,000 home. Following other bribe insinuations and attempts, the defendant clearly offered to pay the CIC staff $ 550 for processed application, for which he would expected a turnover period of one week.In addition to the CIC Senior Programme Officer, the defendant also tried to bribe other employees working in the processing and approval of privately sponsored refugee claims, namely by offering jewellery.The defendant often asked his employer for reference and employment letters, which were delivered to him in the conviction that they were necessary for immigration purposes. The defendant asked several times that the letters stated he received remuneration higher than his real salary. The employer drafted a generic letter with no mention to financial compensation. The employer testified that, in two letters, the signature was not hers. In other instances, she did not recall at all issuing similar letters. She also referred to a number of irregularities in documents, such as reference letters and pay slips, that were strange to her. He worked in the concerned company as a janitor for three years (2004-2007).The competent representatives of the banks where the defendant had his accounts stated he often asked for letters attesting to the funds held. The employees always made sure the values referred were accurate. They testified not to recognise some bank statements or the signature in some of the afore-mentioned type of letters. They also noted a number of irregularities in letters allegedly issued by the bank. A number of accounts referred by the defendant in the applications he sponsored were inexistent. The corresponding certificates were not confirmed by the respective banks.The defendant used the names and personal data of refugees he knew as G5 sponsors, without their knowledge. In addition, many of the alleged sponsors appeared on more than one G5 application.Some asylum seekers testified to have paid (or to have been told they would have to pay) the defendant for his sponsorship. Values amounted to up $ 11 800. These fees would reportedly be to pay administrative fees related to the procedure and support refugees. Sometimes payments were made through the Hawala system; other, via wire transfer. Against this background, it is important to note that all migrants that entered Canada after being sponsored by the defendant did so with valid identity documents and following validation of applications by CIC.The defendant was arrested on 17 November 2011.All relevant evidence was translated from English into Somali. The defendant was assisted by an interpreter and provided evidence in Somali. Legal findings: The defendant was charged with eight counts under the Criminal Code and Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), including (i) migrant smuggling in its modality of facilitating illegal entry into Canada, (ii) corruption, (iii) fraud on government, (iv) forgery and related offences, (v) unlawful possession. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice acquitted the defendant of migrant smuggling and convicted him on the remaining charges. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,0
"Date(s) of offending: on/from 4 May 2006 to 31 January 2011The decision addresses the application submitted by the accused for an order declaring that section 117 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) - dealing with migrant smuggling - is overbroad and, as a consequence, unconstitutional. The defendant was accused of organizing or attempting to organize, between 4 May 2006 and 31 January 2011, the coming to Canada of ten or more Somali irregular migrants (potential refugees) who were not in possession of a visa, passport or other documents required by law to the effect. In the endeavour of pursuing this venture, the defendant was deemed to have fraudulently obtained documentation from the Citizenship and Immigration Services of Canada.The defendant knew some of the irregular migrants he assisted, such as family members, friends, or family or friends of persons he knew. Conversely, many of them were not personally known to the defendant. Yet, the defendant maintained he acted in view of the serious dangers faced by these migrants in Somalia, a reality he was well aware of in view of his own experience. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, notably (i) declarations of the defendant, (ii) declarations of migrants. Arguments of the Prosecution and Legal findings:The defendant was charged with migrant smuggling in its modality of facilitating illegal entry into Canada. He was further accused of misrepresentation, submitting false information and bribery under the IRPA, as well as frauds on the government, forgery, use of fraudulent documents and possession of identity. Contrarily to the pretensions of the defendant, the Prosecution claimed the irregular migrants assisted by the defendant were not in danger so long as they remained in Somalia. It added most of such migrants were no longer in Somalia when the defendant endeavoured to facilitate their entry into Canada. The Prosecution also disputed any insinuation that the defendant acted upon humanitarian concerns.The Prosecution added section 117 IRPA was necessarily and intentionally broad, consequently, it did not violate section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Furthermore, without directly considering the constitutionality of section 117 IRPA, the Federal Court of Appeal had concluded that Canada’s international obligations did not preclude the criminalization of migrant smuggling in the absence of evidence of the intent to obtain a financial or other material benefit. It agreed section 117 IRPA had clearly not been drafted with the specific intention of targeting humanitarians but submitted that those with the requisite intent, even if they had had a benevolent motive, could properly and constitutionally be captured by an offence provision which seeks to secure the borders of the State. Section 117 IRPA is not of automatic application. In determining whether to provide consent for the prosecution as required by section 117(4) IRPA, the Attorney General may take into consideration whether, due to the motives of a prospective accused, a prosecution is in the public interest. Motive is also a relevant consideration on sentencing. Conversely, motive would not be a legal ground to exempt a person of criminal responsibility in the face of conduct that runs against section 117 IRPA. Finally, it noted Canada was not a signatory to some of the international instruments invoked by the Defence. For the arguments submitted by the Defence, see ‘Other background’ under “Accused Persons”. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice deemed section 117 IRPA constitutional. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,0
"This case involves six defendants who were all charged with some or multiple forms of organized crime offences in addition to other serious criminal offences. Three of the defendants, namely Mr Kalonji, Mr Henry and Ms Galbraith, were charged and convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud. Mr Kalonji, with two other men, was running a criminal organization whose main activity was committing account take over frauds. To accomplish this fraud, group members would open new accounts (so-called complicit accounts) or joint accounts that were in some way linked to victim accounts (often identified by hackers that gained illegal access to bank systems or by insiders of the bank). Money was then transferred from the victims’ accounts to the joint or complicit accounts and subsequently withdrawn from the accounts by associates. Intercepted communications of one of the defendants, Mr Kalonji, revealed that he used hackers to identify victim accounts and manipulate bank accounts for fraudulent reasons (e.g., transfer money from victim to complicit accounts).",trafficking in firearms,0
"The two accused in this case were members of a street gang called the ‘Young Buck Killas', also known as ‘the YBK’. The principal aims and objectives of this gang included committing robberies and producing and trafficking drugs, principally crack cocaine. The YBK was founded in Toronto but had extended its activities other cities in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.The modus operandi of the organized criminal group was to rent houses in these cities from which persons lower in the criminal hierarchy would sell crack cocaine. Members of the group transported drugs and sometimes firearms between these cities on inter-city busses.",trafficking in firearms,1
"On March 31, 2013 the Physical Surveillance Unit (""PSU"") of the OPP, including Constable Fraser and Constable DiPietro, left Windsor around 1:55 p.m. and proceeded eastbound on the 401 in pursuit of a vehicle they believed was proceeding eastbound on the 401 near Chatham with Abdullahi and some illegal firearms in it. They received some information to that effect from Detective Landry who was in the wire room associated with the interception of some calls under the court order. They did not know the make of the vehicle but believed it was a rental. Near Campbellville, Fraser and DiPietro observed a white Chrysler 200, with a Quebec licence plate, FGY 1261 (""white car""), and two black men in the front seat. They were Abdullahi, the driver, and Daud Hussein, the front seat passenger. They did not see Khadra Omer who was in the rear seat behind Abdullahi. It was about 4:15 p.m. Fraser believed the white car was a rental, based upon his experience in OPP surveillance. Fraser and DiPietro, who were both driving unmarked police vehicles, followed the white car eastbound to Dixon Road where it exited. While travelling from the Milton area to that exit, Abdullahi and Daud Hussein looked around at other vehicles because they believed they may have been under police surveillance. Abdullahi began to change lanes, accelerating to 130 kms per hour from the normal pace of traffic at the time, about 120 kms per hour. Fraser and DiPietro also exited at Dixon Road. It was about 4:40 p.m. Dixon Road, at that point, is south of the 401 and is, essentially, an east-west road. Just prior to exiting, Fraser radioed for some assistance of marked OPP cruisers. Abdullahi drove the white car eastbound on Dixon Road with Fraser, DiPietro and a marked OPP cruiser behind it. The flashing lights and siren of the cruiser were activated as all of the other vehicles stopped for a red light at the intersection with Chetta Place. It runs north and south. The white car and the unmarked cruisers of DiPietro and Fraser were in the passing lane, not the left turn lane. Suddenly, Abdullahi drove the white car north on Chetta Place, through the red light. It was about 4:45 p.m. He then turned into an apartment complex on the west side of Chetta Place. The entrance to the complex was just north of Dixon Road. The complex related to apartment buildings at 330 Dixon Road and 340 Dixon Road. DiPietro lost sight of the white car, but Fraser did not. Both of them followed the white car into the complex. Fraser and DiPietro took different routes in pursuit of the white car. The white car and Fraser were more to the south of the common area; DiPietro was more to the north. Fraser, however, did briefly lose sight of the white car because of a 4 wall near the entrance to the underground parking for the building. Fraser stopped near the top of the ramp into the parking area. DiPietro arrived there shortly afterwards. Both of them observed some damage to the door to the underground, as if someone had driven through it. Fraser and DiPietro exited their vehicles. They were wearing plainclothes, with an OPP vest and an OPP cap. Both of them carried their OPP rifles as they walked down the ramp, because they had received information that there were some firearms in the white car. Both of them observed the white car parked near a door to a stairwell; it was not situated in a parking stall. It was about 4:55 p.m. There were no people in the car. Abdullahi, Daud Hussein and Khadra Omer had taken flight. The passenger side, the hood and the windshield were damaged. Both of the officers observed a black bag on the front passenger seat. Fraser searched the bag when directed to do so by Detective Landry. Fraser placed it on the trunk. There were three firearms in it, each one in a black sock. One of the items was a Ruger handgun with a clip. The others appeared to be handguns to Fraser. He left the black bag and its contents on the white car, and returned to the top of the ramp to the underground parking, with DiPietro. Fraser advised Landry of the presence of the handguns in the white car. Many police cruisers and uniformed police officers arrived in the area, in an effort to find the occupants of the white car. They stayed there for several hours. DiPietro and Fraser maintained security of the scene at the entrance until about 5:05 p.m. At that time the black bag and its contents were turned over to Detective Purcell, who is a member of the OPP assigned to its Weapons Enforcement Unit. Purcell removed the other two firearms from the black bag. All of them had magazines in them. None of them had ammunition in them. Around 6:40 p.m. he took custody of the black bag and the handguns, and returned to the London Detachment of the OPP. On April 2, 2013 he examined and photographed them.",trafficking in firearms,1
"The charges arise out of a Toronto Police Services (""TPS"") investigation called Project Marvel which took place between September 1 and December 13, 2011 and events that transpired during that period. Project Marvel arose out of a number of shootings which took place in the Driftwood Court area of Toronto in the spring of 2011. Driftwood Court is located east of Jane Street, in the area north of Finch and south of Steeles Avenue. The investigation involved multiple wiretaps and police surveillance culminating on December 13, 2011 with the execution of a numerous search warrants and a large number of arrests. The Crown alleges that Gardner was part of a street gang that called itself the YBK and that was principally engaged in the production, supply and sale of controlled drugs, particularly cocaine, in, among other places, Toronto and Hamilton in Ontario and Surrey in British Columbia (B.C.).  The Crown's case against Gardner is based on numerous intercepted phone conversations, as well as pictures and videos found on cell phones seized from numerous individuals, police surveillance of Gardner and others during the period of the investigation and certain agreed facts. Gardner did not testify and called no other evidence in his defence. Gardner pled guilty of some or all of the charges (15 counts).",trafficking in firearms,1
"The charges against the appellants arose out of an extensive police investigation labelled Project XXX into the Doomstown Crips (also known as the Doomztown Crips or Jamestown Crips). The Doomstown Crips was an alleged criminal gang operating in the Rexdale neighbourhood of the City of Toronto. The four appellants, S.L., S.R., R.C. and V.B. C., were alleged to be distributing drugs and firearms to the Doomstown Crips. They were not suspected of being gang members.  The appellant Alvarez was alleged to be a member of the Doomstown Crips. The Project XXX investigation began in November 2005. Lucas was the initial suspect. He was implicated by a gun smuggler from the United States, Earl Cooke, who identified S.L. as someone who had purchased 110 firearms from him between October 2002 and October 2003. By 2006, the police had only recovered 20 of the firearms. Nine of these recovered guns were linked, directly or indirectly, to the Doomstown Crips. The appellants S.R., R.C. and V.B. C. were targeted for investigation because of their association with S.L.. Police surveillance in January 2006 revealed S.L. leaving S.R.'s residence with a knapsack containing three pipe-shaped objects the police believed to be firearms. On February 13, 2006, police obtained a wiretap authorization under s. 186(1.1) of Part VI of the Criminal Code to intercept private communications of a large number of people including the appellants, S.L. and Alvarez. The authorization was issued by Echlin J. In support of the February 13, 2006 Part VI wiretap authorization, the police filed an Information to Obtain (“ITO”), sworn by Detective Vander Heyden, which consists of more than 1000 pages plus lengthy appendices. Included in the ITO was information that the police obtained from two confidential informants. On March 31, 2006, the initial Part VI authorization was extended in time and expanded in scope. In addition to the wiretap authorizations, the police also obtained three general warrants pursuant to s. 487.01 of the Criminal Code. The general warrants were issued on February 16 and 24, 2006 by Taylor J. and on March 31, 2006 as part of the Part VI authorization issued by Echlin J. The February 16 general warrant authorized covert entry into 20 residences and eight motor vehicles. Among other things, the officers were authorized to copy documents, photograph or seize weapons and controlled substances, examine or record data contained in cellular telephones and covertly retrieve keys. The February 16 warrant was used to search S.L.’s vehicle on March 21, 2006 and his residence on March 25. It was also used to search R.C.'s residence on March 22, during which police observed, but did not seize, a significant quantity of U.S. and Canadian cash. The February 24 general warrant authorized the police to enter a storage locker at a public storage site at 389 Paris Road in Brantford. The search of the locker, conducted on February 25, 2006, revealed that it contained guns, ammunition, drugs, and a box containing 1 kg of cocaine. The box had a label with R.C.'s home address on it. The March 31 general warrant was embedded in the wiretap authorization issued by Echlin J. It authorized the surreptitious entry of a large number of places and vehicles belonging to the appellants or persons associated with them. The March 31 warrant was used to search S.L.’s residence on April 29. The police also executed the general warrant on R.C.'s residence on April 8 and seized approximately $64,000 in cash, a money counter, and other items.  V.B.C.'s vehicle was searched without a warrant on May 16, 2006. During this search the police seized a laptop bag containing $17,000 in cash. Arrest and search warrants were executed on May 18, 2006 (the “take-down warrants”). The take-down warrants authorized the police to enter the premises of a large number of individuals, including the appellants, without knocking or giving notice to the occupants, in order to effect the arrests of the individuals named in the warrants and to search the premises. Pursuant to the take-down warrants, the police arrested 102 persons, including the five appellants, in the early morning hours during dynamic no-knock entries. During the search of R.C.'s residence, police found $20,000 in cash and marijuana. During the search of V.B.C.'s residence, the police found $6,195 cash in the possession of another male, a safe containing $2,000 in cash, a money counter, several cell phones, and a document believed to be a debt list. During the search of S.R.'s residence, police seized $3530 and US$450, a money counter, and numerous cell phones. S.R. also had $1,000 on his person when he was arrested. The search of Lucas’ residence revealed numerous cell phones, a money counter, and a hollowed-out book that had been seen to contain cash during a covert entry into his residence on March 25. S.L., S.R., R.C. and V.B. C. were charged with various firearms and/or drug-related offences on a 29-count indictment. Alvarez was charged together with six co-accused on a 126-count indictment.",trafficking in firearms,1
"The accused, Ritchie Nguyen, is charged with trafficking in firearms for the benefit of a criminal organization contrary to section 467.12 of the Canadian Criminal Code.  He is also charged with two counts of trafficking in firearms and 11 counts of possession of firearms for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested on May 28, 2014, at the same time as some 50 other individuals following violent rivalry between five street gangs in the city of Toronto. The offences with which he is charged are reverse onus offences, but the lower court said that it was “reasonably confident” that the accused could be released and that the proposed plan of the sureties would address the safety of the public. He granted an order of judicial interim release to Mr. Nguyen with two sureties, his mother, Thi B Nguyen, in the amount of $60,000 and his cousin, Quy Tam Nhan, in the amount of $10,000. The prosecution/the Crown seeks instead an order of detention and not bail.",trafficking in firearms,1
"On April 23, 2010, private investigators working on behalf of the Workplace Safety Insurance Board were watching the respondent. The evidence of one of the investigators was that after running a number of errands, the respondent met with another man. Following a short conversation, the respondent pulled out what looked like a pistol from the side pocket of his jacket, and appeared to point it at the man. He then returned the pistol to his jacket, went back to his car, and drove away. The investigators were concerned about what they had seen and informed the Ottawa Police Service.The police went to the respondent’s trailer. The officer who ultimately found and seized the apparent pistol in question testified that he saw a black handgun resting on a chair in plain view in a shed beside the trailer. Further investigation determined that the handgun was a Crosman Pro77 airgun that fires .177 calibre spherical BBs propelled by means of compressed air from a canister. The airgun was fully functional and loaded with a partly used CO2 cartridge. There was no ammunition in the magazine. The person the respondent had pointed the gun at was a friend. The respondent had not pointed the gun to threaten or intimidate him.A firearms examiner who gave expert evidence agreed in cross-examination that this type of airgun can be purchased without the purchaser’s having to produce any documentation, as long as the muzzle velocity does not exceed 500 feet per second (“ft./s.”). The respondent’s airgun had an average velocity of 261.41 ft./s.The expert further testified that this particular airgun is built to closely resemble a Steyr MA1 9mm pistol, a conventional semi-automatic handgun.The respondent was charged with the following offences: handling a firearm or imitation thereof in a careless manner, contrary to s. 86 of the Criminal Code; pointing a firearm, contrary to s. 87; carrying a weapon or imitation thereof for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 88; and carrying a concealed weapon or imitation thereof contrary to s. 90.The trial judge held that the Crown had failed to prove that the airgun was used or intended for use in any of the ways specified in s. 2. It was therefore not a weapon, and could not be a firearm. It was also not shown to be a replica firearm.On appeal, the main issue was the proper interpretation of the terms “firearm” and “weapon” in the Criminal Code. I.e. must an object (to use a neutral word) that falls within the definition of “firearm” in s. 2 also meet the definition for “weapon” in the same section. The interpretation issue arises from the fact that each definition refers to the other.The judge on appeal concluded there was no ambiguity in the definition of firearm in s. 2 when regard is had to the legislative history and the context and scheme of the legislation. Barrelled objects that meet the definition of firearm in s. 2 need not also meet the definition in para. (a) or (b) of weapon to be deemed to be firearms and hence weapons for the various weapons offences in the Code, such as the offences charged against the respondent in this case.Accordingly, the appeal was allowed, on counts 1, 3 and 4 (careless handling of a firearm, carrying a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, and carrying a concealed weapon) and a new trial ordered on those charges.",trafficking in firearms,1
"In early February 2017 the first victim was introduced to the accused by one of her friends at Stardust Motel in Ottowa area. The purpose of the meeting was that she was interested to work as an escort. In this night the accused has offered to help the victim to find a job. One week after, the accused went to her home, picked her up and transported her to Toronto where she stayed at a condominium the accused has rented for her. Over the next week, the victim worked as a prostitute under the supervision of the accused, mostly at hotels, in exchange for drugs, specifically, cocaine which was provided to her by the accused. Upon discussing the issue with her grandmother, the victim went to the police and reported the incident.   The accused met the second victim in August 2015, when she was introduced to him by her boyfriend’s sister in Toronto, as she was into working as an escort. For the period of four months, she used to work in sex trade mostly out of a condominium the accused was renting and out of hotel rooms the accused was booking to her. Knowing that the victim was a drug addict and has a young child, the accused used to exploit the victim to keep working in sex trade by providing her with drugs in return to providing sexual services to customers. The accused used psychological pressure over the victim by promising her that money he receives from her work will be sent to her child and her mother who are financially disadvantaged.",trafficking in persons,1
"The complainant was homeless and living in a shelter when she met the appellant. She was about 18 or 19 years old. She was working as a sex trade worker. Her two children were in custody of the Children’s Aid Society. The appellant offered her a place to live in his apartment. They lived together for approximately seven years. The complainant said the appellant led her to believe that she could have a better life and that he would adopt her children, if she worked hard. She testified that he psychologically abused and controlled her, including by keeping most of the money she earned. The appellant advertised her sexual services, took calls from her clients and told her what to charge clients. On some occasions, he punched her, pushed her out of her chair and sometimes hid in hotel rooms when she was with a customer. In her testimony, she said that she tolerated the way he treated her because she had nowhere to go, no money, no friends or family to turn to, and he was all she had. She also said that, despite not being in a romantic relationship with the appellant, she felt attached to and invested in him due to the time and money she had given him.She had hundreds of clients over the years when she was with the appellant. During cross-examination, the complainant said that no one told her there would be consequences if she refused a client, however she felt she had no one to turn to and this was her only option. Sometimes ,she left the appellant and went to other cities, including Edmonton, although she still provided him with her earnings.The appellant did not testify. At trial, his defence was that he was the complainant’s friend who helped her with various aspects of her involvement in the sex trade, at the complainant’s request. The appellant also took the position that the complainant chose to work in the sex trade of her own free will and denied any coercion or violence on his part.",trafficking in persons,1
"This case is an appeal of acquittals by the trial judge of the offences of human trafficking, procuring a person to provide sexual services and advertising sexual services for consideration. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a re-trial.The respondent (accused) and victim both worked as dancers in a strip club. The victim subsequently became involved in providing sexual services for consideration, alleging that the respondent encouraged her to do so. The victim further noted that she provided all the money earned to the respondent and that she went along with what the respondent suggested because she was afraid.Amongst other things, the appeal centred around the essential elements of the human trafficking offence, The Court of Appeal confirmed that the actus reus element of the human trafficking offence is disjunctive meaning that only one of the specified acts must be established (e.g., recruit or transport or receive or exercise control direction or influence). The Court noted that this is consistent with the purpose of the human trafficking offence which is to cover a wide range of target directed at the exploitation of vulnerable persons. It also held that this is consistent with principles of statutory interpretation, including that the legislature must have intended that every word in the offence was to mean something distinct. The Court also confirmed that “exercising influence” is less coercive than “exercising direction.” Further, the Court confirmed that the human trafficking offence does not require that actual exploitation of a victim occur, but rather that the accused intended for the victim to be exploited.Given the trial judge’s errors in describing the essential elements of the human trafficking offence to the jury, the Court of Appeal ordered a re-trial.",trafficking in persons,1
"The victim is a 15 years old girl, who used to live in Stratford, Canada with her parents. Given her struggle with a crystal methamphetamine addiction, and resulting conflicts with her mother, she decided to run away from home. The victim went to her friend’s home in Seaforth and stayed with him and his grandmother. Her friend was already in contact with the second defendant Alexis-McLymont through social media, who used to live in Toronto and who asked him to join the ‘Cash Gang’ and help him recruit young females to engage in prostitution in return for a significant amount of money. Consequently, the Seaforth friend agreed to do so and introduced him to the victim, who did not understand the nature of the work that the defendant was offering her. After several contact between the victim and Alexis-McLymont, they agreed to meet and the victim was transferred to a hotel in Kitchener, where she met the other two defendants Dylan Hird and Anthony Elgin, and a female prostitute. Upon their meeting, the victim was provided with crystal methamphetamine in return for providing sexual services to a stranger. Realizing the situation and the type of work that the defendants expected her to engage in, the victim refused and insisted on leaving the hotel. She was prevented from doing so and threatened with violence by the first and third defendant. For more than a week, the victim was forced to provide sexual services to men in exchange for money and to sell drugs, while defendants kept all financial benefits. Furthermore, the accused took several revealing photographs of the victim and placed them on the internet to advertise her services. The victim was also sexually assaulted by both the second and third defendant. During that period, the victim was provided with no food, no toiletries and her cellular telephone was taken away from her. When required to meet a client outside of the hotel, the victim was able to escape and hide in a nearby store, where she called the police, who then rescued her.",trafficking in persons,1
"Ms. Robitaille was charged along with Mr. Finestone with offences relating to forcing two minors to work in the sex trade. At the time of the offences, Ms. Robitaille was a sex trade worker herself and Mr. Finestone was her pimp. She was also dating Mr. Finestone and believed herself to be in love with him. Mr. Finestone was charged with human trafficking and other offences. Ms. Robitaille has entered a plea of guilty to two counts of receiving a material benefit from the sexual services of two minors pursuant to section 286.2(2) of the Criminal Code. The issue before this Court is what is the appropriate sentence for Ms. Robitaille.On February 21, 2015, J.D., a 14 year old girl, was introduced to Mr. Finestone and Ms. Robitaille through a mutual acquaintance.  J.D. met with Mr. Finestone and Ms. Robitaille at the Marriot Hotel at 90 Bloor Street West.The following day, Mr. Finestone directed a third party named “Swiffy” to book a second hotel room.  Mr. Finestone then forced J.D. to engage in prostitution day and night.  Four days later, Ms. Robitaille and Mr. Finestone moved J.D. to a different hotel where she was again forced to work as a prostitute to pay off all the rooms and the expenses of the group. According to the agreed statement of facts, no violence or explicit threats of violence were used to compel J.D. to engage in prostitution.  Instead, Mr. Finestone took advantage of J.D.’s vulnerability as a means to control her.Ms. Robitaille and Mr. Finestone directed J.D. on what clothes to wear.  Ms. Robitaille provided further instructions on how to act with customers, what type of services to perform, the definition of various terms and other relevant information on how to engage in prostitution. Mr. Finestone posted an advertisement for J.D.’s services stating that J.D. was 19 years old.  Over the course of the week that J.D. was under Mr. Finestone’s control, J.D. serviced approximately 20-30 clients with the sexual services including oral and vaginal sex. While customers paid thousands of dollars for J.D.’s services, she was not permitted to set the price of her services or keep the money.   All proceeds went to Mr. Finestone who then spent some of those proceeds on Ms. Robitaille. On February 27, 2015, J.D. stated to another prostitute that she wanted to go home. J.D.’s mother offered to pay for a taxi to bring J.D. home.  Upon discovering this, Ms. Robitaille took J.D.’s cellular telephone from her and advised J.D. that she was not allowed to contact anyone.  Mr. Finestone then unplugged the hotel room telephone and asked the hotel to block all calls to J.D.’s room.  J.D. was then instructed to prepare for her next customer.  Mr. Finestone left the room and Ms. Robitaille yelled at J.D. who by this time was crying and felt like a hostage who had no means of escape.   Security, responding to a noise complaint, attended at J.D’s room moments later and found J.D. crying.  J.D. told security that she was under aged and was being forced to engage in prostitution.  In January of 2015, Ms. Robitaille contacted C.S., whom she knew from high school, and spoke about her work as an escort.  C.S. was 16 years old at the time.   Shortly thereafter, a friend of Mr. Finestone contacted C.S. and arrangements were made to bring C.S. to the hotel where Mr. Finestone and Ms. Robitaille worked. When C.S. met Mr. Finetstone she advised him that she was only 16 years old.  Mr. Finestone and Mr. Taylor stated they would not work with C.S. but Mr. Finestone then directed Ms. Robitaille to tell C.S. that she would work for Ms. Robitaille privately.   Mr. Robitaille brought C.S. her first customer. C.S. performed a hand job on this customer.  Ms. Robitaille told C.S. to hand over all the money she made from this act to pay for the cost of bringing C.S. to the hotel. C.S. saw four more customers and had sexual intercourse with one of these customers.  Ms. Robitaille instructed C.S. on how to dress and what to do. The following day, after moving hotels C.S. left.  Immediately after leaving, Ms. Robitaille telephoned and sent text messages to C.S. demanding that she return to the hotel.",trafficking in persons,1

A.A. then asked G whether she loved him and whether she would dance for him.A.A. explained that if G danced for him they could have the life they wanted. They would be together and retire in ten years. G felt that she had finally found somebody who wanted her and would protect and look after her forever.At the end of their meeting in the park, G understood that she and A.A. would be together. She agreed to dance in strip clubs so that she and A.A. could have their life together.Shortly after the meeting in the park, A.A. wanted G to go to a club.G demurred. She said she was not feeling well. She did not want to start dancing immediately.A.A. and his friend, M.J., took G to a store that sold “dancer stuff”.A.A. chose the outfit for G M.J. paid for it.G danced first at Pigale, a Gatineau club. A.A. dropped her off at the club. She used her older sister’s identification. She earned $60 from private dances. She also performed on stage but received no money for this.A booker at the club told G to return after she had gained some dancing experience. G called A.A. to pick her up. When A.A. arrived, G gave him the $60 she had earned. A.A. said that he was proud of her. After a club refused to accept her identification, A.A. and M.J. took G to the Silver Dollar. G described the Silver Dollar as a “disgusting” place but danced there. During private dances, she was asked to remove and did remove her top. The patrons touched her. She also danced on stage. At the end of the evening, A.A. and M.J. picked her up and drove her home. When she turned over her earnings to A.A., he said “only $40?”For the following two weeks, G danced at the Silver Dollar every day the club was open. A.A. picked her up at home in M.J.’s car and drove her to the club. She earned $200 to $400 per night. She turned the money over to A.A. who, with M.J., picked her up at the club and drove her back to her father’s place. A.A. told G that he was “so happy” and that she was doing better and better. About two weeks into her tenure at the Silver Dollar, a bouncer told G that people were sceptical that she was the age shown on her older sister’s identification. G panicked. She was not sure where she would go. She “needed to work”.G told A.A. about her conversation with the bouncer. A.A. promised her new identification. They went together to have passport photographs taken. A.A. used $600 from G’s earnings to get her two new sets of identification. A.A. and M.J. decided that G should go to Montreal and Toronto to become a better dancer. M.J. took G to Montreal and then to Toronto. In Toronto, she earned $2,000, which she gave to M.J. to turn over to A.A.When G returned from Toronto with M.J., he explained to her that her situation would be improved if she danced for him. M.J. asked her to choose between him and A.A. G chose A.A. M.J. punched G in the face and threw her things out of his car. A.A. told G to get into the car with another friend, Aleck, who would be joining him in picking up and dropping off G Aleck had a girl N, who would be working for him. Around the end of September 2011, G left home and moved into a motel. Soon, N joined her. The nightly routine was for G to dance at the Silver Dollar and to turn over her earnings, $300 to $600, to A.A. who would pick her up and drop her off at the motel. Sometimes, her shifts lasted 14 hours. G stayed at the motel when she was not dancing. She severed contact with her parents. A.A. told her that he was her family and that she was to stay at the motel. She stopped attending school.A.A. encouraged G to do “extras” to earn more money. He told her that she should charge $100 for sex. A customer at the Silver Dollar paid her $100 for vaginal sex. She gave the money to A.A.During her stay at the motel, A.A. began to hit G regularly, often when she talked back to him. On her birthday, A.A. hit G repeatedly on her head with his iPhone.After about a month at the motel and regular dancing at the Silver Dollar, G learned that A.A. had brought in another girl to do the same thing. G left the motel. She took a bus home. She stayed at home for a week. A.A. phoned several times each day. He pleaded for G to return. A.A. assured G that she was the one he loved and planned to marry. The other girl, he said, was just for extra money. After a week at home, G returned to A.A. and Aleck. She was convinced that A.A. finally realized that she was going to be with him forever and that he was going to change and not hurt her.In mid-November 2011, G was kicked out of the Barefax because she was chronically late. She went home and stayed there for a month. She told A.A. that her father had died and that she would be receiving an inheritance. A.A. asked her repeatedly when she could return to work and when she would be getting her inheritance.Sometime later, G told A.A. that she would not be receiving an inheritance. She also told him that she realized that he would not want to be with her anymore. When asked why she left in November, G explained that, despite his promises, A.A. had not changed his ways. He expected her to work long hours to make more money and would not allow her to carry her own money because she might use it to run away or spend it on “stupid stuff”. A.A. wanted G to accompany him, Aleck and N to Toronto before Christmas, 2011. G agreed to go. She wanted to see whether A.A. had changed. She also wanted to stop N from making “the biggest mistake in her life”. A.A. told G that she would make more money dancing in the clubs in Toronto.On December 28, 2011, Aleck, A.A., G and N drove to Toronto in Aleck’s car. Shortly after their arrival at a hotel, G realized that nothing had changed. Despite promises to the contrary, A.A. hit her several times after she teased him about wanting to sleep with Aleck. He hit her hard enough to draw blood. A.A. told her that she would have to work the next day.Early the next morning, G texted the police. She told an officer from the Ottawa Police Service, with whom she had spoken earlier, that she was scared because she was going to have to return to the clubs. Two local police officers met G outside the hotel and took her back to Ottawa. Later that morning, the police arrested Aleck and A.A. at the hotel.",trafficking in persons,1

"The victims met Tyrone BURTON while he was selling drugs on the street. They began a conversation and before long were in a hotel room consuming crack cocaine, a first for one of the victims. One victim fell in love with BURTON. For approximately one week, the victims provided sexual services to clients in several hotels under BURTON’s control. BURTON set up an advertisement for the victims’ sexual services and provided them with a phone so clients could call. BURTON also set rules: the victims were not permitted to leave the premise without him; they always had to be within his sight; they could not talk to other people; the nature and cost of their sexual services was determined by him; they could not service black customers; and all money they earned was to be handed over to him. BURTON also controlled the victims’ passports. While the victims provided sexual services to clients, BURTON would stand outside the hotel room and would advise through knocking on the door when the time paid for was over. BURTON insisted the victims call him “daddy” and would have them kiss a diamond ring he wore. The victims could only wear certain clothing and were permitted on occasion to eat, but only if enough money was earned from providing sexual services to others. BURTON used fear of unspoken consequences and possible harm to control the victims.",trafficking in persons,1
"The victims in this case had experiences with prostitution prior to meeting Curtis Ryan HUTCHINSON. At the beginning of each relationship, HUTCHINSON was very respectful and nice towards the victims. HUTCHINSON recruited the victims by making them believe they were in romantic relationships with him. With time, HUTCHINSON imposed himself in the victims’ lives and eventually gained control over them in order to recoup the money the victims earned through prostitution. The victims were forced to prostitute mainly within adult entertainment establishments, namely exotic dance clubs. HUTCHINSON psychologically controlled the victims by using, for example, humiliation and verbal abuse. He also used control tactics such as violence (physical abuse), intimidation, and threats. HUTCHINSON set rules and quotas that the victims had to follow and also monitored them while they were at the clubs. The victims were forced to constantly be at the clubs and also hand over all the money that was earned. One victim handed over between $3,000 and $4,000 per week and when she wanted to leave, HUTCHINSON advised that she owed him $10,000. One victim became pregnant and HUTCHINSON forced her to dance and also continued to be violent with her.",trafficking in persons,1
"The victim and a friend traveled from Ontario to Quebec to meet some new people, including Jamie BYRON who paid and arranged for their travels. The victim was introduced to BYRON when she arrived in Quebec and stayed with him in an apartment with other individuals. The victim believed BYRON wanted to have a romantic relationship. The victim’s friend left the situation, but the victim remained as she did not have money to return home. BYRON soon after told the victim that she belonged to him and would be working for him. The victim told BYRON she was only 17 years old and tried to resist; as a result, the victim was threatened and physically assaulted. BYRON intentionally damaged the victim’s identification documents and forced the victim to provide sexual services to a man for money. BYRON made this arrangement and kept the money the victim earned. The victim was subsequently moved throughout various cities in Quebec and Ontario over a two-month period during which time she was prostituted by BYRON and forced to have sex for money with more than 100 men. BYRON took all the money the victim earned and only provided her with enough to buy food and clothing. BYRON took photos of the victim wearing minimal clothing in order to advertise her on the internet, determined the content of these ads, and arranged the hotel rooms where the victim provided the sexual services. BYRON used force to ensure the victim complied with his demands.",trafficking in persons,1
"In 2007, the victim entered into a two year contract to work for the ORR family in Hong Kong to take care of their children. After approximately one year, Franco ORR told the victim the family was moving to Canada and invited her to join to continue taking care of the children. ORR told the victim a second domestic helper would be employed to take care of the chores, similar to their arrangement in Hong Kong. The victim was told she would work eight hours per day and would be paid as per Canadian law. ORR advised the victim that he would assist her in becoming a permanent resident of Canada once she had been in the country for two years. The victim agreed to come to Canada so that she could continue to earn money to send back to her family. ORR arranged for the victim’s travel documentation. When in Canada, ORR did not hire a second domestic helper and the victim was required to assist with chores such as cooking, cleaning in addition to looking after the children. ORR paid the victim less than what she would have been entitled to according to British Columbia law. When the victim came to know that she was in Canada illegally, because she had no friends or relations in Canada, she was socially isolated with limited available options to resolve her situation. The victim’s employment in Canada arose from the initial deception from ORR that she would have the same working conditions as she did in Hong Kong.",trafficking in persons,1

"The case involves an individual associated with the NetWalker organized criminal group, which was responsible for providing ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). Their RaaS model involved developers (i.e., individuals who develop, update, and make the ransomware available) and affiliates (i.e., individuals who rent the ransomware, identify targets, and deploy ransomware). The NetWalker RaaS offered affiliates the ability to rent access to the ransomware in exchange for a portion of the proceeds obtained from extorting targets. The ransomware targeted emergency services, law enforcement, healthcare institutions, educational institutions, and commercial institutions.In 2021, the defendant, Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, was arrested and detained in Canada pursuant to an extradition order by the United States of America. The defendant was not ‘surrender[ed] to the U.S. …because he had outstanding drug trafficking charges in Quebec,’ which “were resolved on 21 January 2022,’ when he ‘was sentenced to 54 months’ imprisonment for five drug trafficking and related charges and possession of property obtained by crime’.

Three of the defendants, namely Mr Kalonji, Mr Henry and Ms Galbraith, were charged and convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud. Mr Kalonji, with two other men, was running a criminal organization whose main activity was committing account take over frauds. To accomplish this fraud, group members would open new accounts (so-called complicit accounts) or joint accounts that were in some way linked to victim accounts (often identified by hackers that gained illegal access to bank systems or by insiders of the bank). Money was then transferred from the victims’ accounts to the joint or complicit accounts and subsequently withdrawn from the accounts by associates. Intercepted communications of one of the defendants, Mr Kalonji, revealed that he used hackers to identify victim accounts and manipulate bank accounts for fraudulent reasons (e.g., transfer money from victim to complicit accounts).",participation in organized criminal group,0
"The case involves an immigration procedure brought against a Kosovar national of Albanian descent. The applicant was declared inadmissible under the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) on grounds of organized criminality for engaging in migrant smuggling. As a consequence, any previously held residence title was revoked against which the applicant filed for judicial review at the Federal Court in Toronto.In December 2011, a Colombian national began trying to find someone who could help him and his family, who were living in Canada but did not have status, to enter the United States. He was introduced to a man named “Amigo” who agreed to facilitate the smuggling of him, and the other five members of his extended family, into the United States, for CAD 15,000. Of this, CAD 5,000 was paid in advance as a deposit.On 26 January 2012, the six of them were picked up by the applicant in a black caravan in Kitchener, Ontario and were driven to the Canada/US border at Stanstead, Quebec. Next to the applicant two more men were already in the vehicle:  Amigo was sitting in the front passenger seat; and a third man (who was going to be crossing the border with them). A member of the group of six had CAD 10,000 CAD in $100 bills in a brown envelope to complete payment. In evidence, it was said that the envelope with the money was handed towards the front seats of the vehicle, to either Amigo or the applicant.When the group reached the area of the border crossing, everyone but the applicant got out of the vehicle. They were directed to walk through the woods. Amigo led the way. He was speaking on his cell phone with someone who was believed to be the person who would be picking them up on the U.S. side of the border. As they were walking, the others had difficulty keeping up with Amigo and eventually lost sight of him. Shortly afterwards, at about 8:00 p.m, the group was apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in a field just over the from Boulevard Notre-Dame Est in Stanstead. They never saw Amigo again.At about the same time, officers of Canada’s RCMP's Integrated Border Enforcement Team decided to stop the black Dodge Caravan the applicant was driving as it was leaving a gas station in Stanstead, based on information from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. When they searched the applicant, the officers found an envelope containing CAD 9,900 in $100 bills in his left side breast jacket pocket. The applicant admitted later that it originally contained CAD 10,000 but he had spent some money on gas and other items. After further questioning the applicant, the officers determined that they had grounds to arrest him for conspiring to smuggle migrants into the United States.The applicant was charged with conspiracy to commit an offence contrary to section 465(3) of the Criminal Code, RSC, 1985, c C-46. Eventually, on 8 June 2016, this charge was stayed by the Crown under section 579 of the Criminal Code. However, on that same date the applicant consented to the forfeiture of the cash seized from him on 26 January 2012 as proceeds of crime.On 7 September 2016, an Inland Enforcement Officer with the Canada Border Services Agency issued a report stating that the applicant was inadmissible to Canada under section 37(1)(b) of the IRPA on grounds of organized criminality for engaging, in the context of transnational crime, in migrant smuggling. The officer's opinion was based on information gathered with respect to events that had occurred on and leading up to 26 January 2012.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"In 2010, Mr Burnett, a Sergent from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), stole 10 kilograms of cocaine seized from a previous investigation from the RCMP exhibit vault. Mr. Burnett then brought the cocaine to Mr. Rowlings. Mr. Rowlings, with the help of Mr. Kanasevitch, packed the cocaine in bags in order to sell them. Mr. Kanasevitch sold the cocaine to several buyers.It is estimated that the sale of cocaine brought approximately CAD 300,000 to the group, divided equally between the three members of the group. Mr. Burnett used his share of the proceeds to buy a motorcycle. Mr. Kanasevitch stored CAD 40,000 of his share at Mr. Rowlings' house, who later used it to purchase a building.In 2016, as Mr. Kanasevitch could not get back his share from Mr. Rowlings, he decided to contact a police officer to inform him of the fact that Mr. Burnett had stolen cocaine and trafficked it with the help of Mr. Rowlings.When Mr. Burnett learned about the investigation, he asked Mr. Rowlings to cooperate with him in order to avoid suspicion and to lie in his interview with the police.",participation in organized criminal group,1

Ursino was alleged to be a ""boss"" within the global criminal organization known as the ‘Ndrangheta, based in Calabria, Italy. An undercover investigation was conducted between 7 May 2014 and 27 May 2015 with the use of an undercover police agent that had formerly been a career criminal. As part of his agreement with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, he was enrolled in a witness protection programme. During the investigation, the police agent arranged to meet with the defendants to discuss methods of cocaine importation into Canada. At these meetings both of the defendants were recorded using audio and video surveillance, which was later used as evidence to convict both of drug related offences, participation in an organized criminal group, as well as possession of proceeds of crime offences. The investigation was concluded in June 2015 with the arrest of the defendants. Both of the defendants were convicted in 2018 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, in Toronto, Ontario, and sentenced on 28 February 2019.The conspiracy charges of the defendants in this case related to a conspiracy involving one Richard Avanes.

Given her struggle with a crystal methamphetamine addiction, and resulting conflicts with her mother, she decided to run away from home. The victim went to her friend’s home in Seaforth and stayed with him and his grandmother. Her friend was already in contact with the second defendant Alexis-McLymont through social media, who used to live in Toronto and who asked him to join the ‘Cash Gang’ and help him recruit young females to engage in prostitution in return for a significant amount of money. Consequently, the Seaforth friend agreed to do so and introduced him to the victim, who did not understand the nature of the work that the defendant was offering her. After several contact between the victim and Alexis-McLymont, they agreed to meet and the victim was transferred to a hotel in Kitchener, where she met the other two defendants Dylan Hird and Anthony Elgin, and a female prostitute. Upon their meeting, the victim was provided with crystal methamphetamine in return for providing sexual services to a stranger.

The child sexual abuse was either pre-recorded or livestreamed. The defendant also directly communicated with children through a Viber account and sexually exploited them, sending them sexualized and graphic images, including images of his penis, offering them money in exchange for images of their vaginas, and directing the child victims to pass the defendant’s Viber account to other young girls. The exact number of the defendant’s victims is unknown. The defendant pleaded guilty to over 40 child sexual abuse and exploitation-related offences, including conspiracy charges relating to creating child sexual abuse material.  He was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment for his offending and was required to register as a sex offender for life (pursuant to the Sex Offender Information and Registration Act). The defendant was also prohibited from using the Internet or any other digital network to access content that violates the law, communicate with a minor, or “directly or indirectly access any social media sites, social network, Internet discussion forum or chatroom, or maintain a personal profile on any such service.” Furthermore, he was required to pay “[CAD] 200.00 victim fine surcharge imposed for each of the 40 counts to which Mr. Chicoine has pleaded guilty, for a total of [CAD] 8,000.00.”",participation in organized criminal group,1
"In July 2006, Sûreté du Québec (""SQ"") (the provincial police force for the Canadian province of Quebec) received information from a police source regarding Gérald and Felicitas O'Reilly’s engagement in fraudulent activities through the framework of their legitimate businesses. Around the same time, the Royal Bank of Canada reported a suspicious transaction implicating Serge Perron.Subsequent police investigations, which continued from July 2006 to March 2008, uncovered a comprehensive cigarette contraband scheme and associated money laundering activities.Under this scheme, contraband cigarettes in standard cases were delivered from a wide variety of suppliers to a residential house in a suburb of Montreal, before being re-packaged in large cardboard boxes and transported to a refrigerated trailer-truck in Montreal, which then continued on to Nova Scotia where the cigarettes were then distributed for sale. The proceeds of the sales were returned to Montreal though various means (such as soap boxes delivered by Canada Post) before being laundering, in part, using ATMs.Charges were brought against a total of 20 individuals in five different cases corresponding to different criminal activities.

"Project Flatlined involved a 10 month investigation beginning in May 2011 into the criminal activities of members of the Manitoba chapter of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club and the Redlined Support Crew. The Redlined Support Crew was a subsidiary group of the Hells Angels in Manitoba formed to provide ‘street-level enforcement’ for the Hells Angels in a dispute with another motorcycle gang, Rock Machine, over territory for drug trafficking in Manitoba. The dispute had been ongoing since early 2010. The two warring gangs had been involved in a number of violent conflicts, including drive-by shootings, firebombings and physical assaults. Project Flatlined ultimately led to the arrest of 25 members of the Hells Angels and Redlined and associates of these clubs in relation to the criminal operation involved in this case, with charges being laid against 16 of those people. At least 9 of these 16 people were successfully convicted. Information about the criminal proceedings against the other 7 people was not available at the time of writing. In relation to the 9 people not charged with criminal offences, sureties to keep the peace were successfully obtained in relation to at least 6 of these people. Information about whether sureties were successfully obtained against the other 3 was not available at the time of writing.The organized criminal group in this case was involved in trafficking between one and two kilograms of cocaine every month between May 2011 and February 2012 in Winnipeg, primarily in Elmwood. A court heard that the operation generated more than CAD 100,000 every month. During the period of the group’s operation, dealers for the group were receiving more than 500 phone calls per day on dedicated cellphones used for their illegal activities. A judge later described the organization as ‘well organized, well equipped, well financed and highly profitable’.The criminal group was led by Mr Dale Jason Sweeney, who bought the cocaine from suppliers in British Columbia. He then gave the cocaine to members of the Redlined Support Crew, a subsidiary gang of the Hells Angels, who turned the cocaine into crack cocaine and sold it in small quantities to users on the street. This was performed at two properties in Winnipeg. The Hells Angels and the Redlined Support Crew met weekly to exchange profits from their operations. In January 2012, police arrested one of the accused as he was leaving one of these weekly meetings and seized nearly CAD 20,000 in cash. In a later operation in February 2012, police seized one kilogram of cocaine.At 7AM on 16 March 2012, more than 150 Winnipeg officers raided the properties of a number of Hells Angels’ members and associates. Search warrants were executed at six addresses. Nine people were arrested, including the chapter president, Mr Dale Jason Sweeney, as well as Messrs Roderick (Rod) Patrick Sweeney, Carmine Puteri, Kurtis Donald Scott, Christopher Allan Gerula, Brendin Kyle Wall, Thomas Clinton Barnecki, Jonathon Stewart and Donovan Michael Lafrance. Only four members of the Hells Angels’ Manitoba chapter at the time were not arrested in the raids.Police seized approximately two kilograms of cocaine and an undisclosed amount of cash in the raids. Police also seized a motorcycle owned by Mr Dale Sweeney which was on show at the Winnipeg Convention Centre. A number of items were also seized from Mr Scott’s property during the execution of the search warrant.

"B010, J.P., G.J., B306 and H (the “migrants”) were all found inadmissible to Canada under s. 37(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (“IRPA”) on the ground that they had been engaged in organized criminal smuggling. The result of being ruled inadmissible under s. 37(1)(b) is that the refugee claimant is peremptorily excluded from Canada without consideration of his or her claim on the merits. The migrants all say they were simply helping fellow asylum-seekers flee persecution, and were not engaged in people smuggling.H is a native of Cuba who was accepted as a refu­gee by the United States. Two years later, he purchased a boat with two others and used it to transport 48 Cubans to the United States without the knowledge of United States authorities. Convicted in the United States of alien smuggling and receiving a deportation order from the United States, he came to Canada and claimed refugee protection.B010, J.P., G.J., and B306 are among a group of nearly 500 Tamils from Sri Lanka who boarded the cargo ship Sun Sea in Thailand. The organizers of the voyage promised to transport them to Canada for sums ranging from $20,000 to $30,000 per person. Shortly after de­parture, the Thai crew abandoned the ship, leaving the asylum-seekers on board to their own devices. Twelve of the migrants took over various duties during the three-month voyage across the Pacific Ocean to Canada. The ship was dilapidated, unsafe and crowded. Food was in short supply and the fear of interception was constant. B010 worked two three-hour shifts in the engine room each day, monitoring the temperature, water and oil level of the equipment. J.P., who was accompanied by his wife G.J., stood lookout, read the GPS and radar, and acted as an assistant navigator during the voyage. B306 vol­unteered to act as a cook and lookout. He cooked three meals a day for the crew, and used a telescope to spot ap­proaching trawlers and notify the crew so that passengers could be hidden below deck to avoid interception.The Immigration and Refugee Board (“Board”) found the migrants inadmissible to Canada, on the basis that s. 37(1)(b) of the IRPA covers all acts of assistance to illegal migrants and does not require a profit motive. On judicial review to the Federal Court, B010’s appli­cation was rejected while the applications of J.P., G.J., B306 and H were allowed. The Federal Court of Appeal rejected B010’s appeal and in the remaining cases, the court allowed the appeals and reinstated the Board’s de­cisions of inadmissibility.",participation in organized criminal group,1

While there T.T. had sexual relations with a number of men for money: other people arranged the venues and hotels, made the bookings with men, handled the money, took her to various venues and told her during that period she could not contact her mother. She was also told people were after her.  She received no money from the proceeds of prostitution and little food. H.H. and R.C were also underage but had leadership roles and were older than T.T.T.T. ultimately returned home after a ten day absence. She was sick, malnourished and exhausted.

"On March 31, 2013 the Physical Surveillance Unit (""PSU"") of the OPP, including Constable Fraser and Constable DiPietro, left Windsor around 1:55 p.m. and proceeded eastbound on the 401 in pursuit of a vehicle they believed was proceeding eastbound on the 401 near Chatham with Abdullahi and some illegal firearms in it. They received some information to that effect from Detective Landry who was in the wire room associated with the interception of some calls under the court order. They did not know the make of the vehicle but believed it was a rental. Near Campbellville, Fraser and DiPietro observed a white Chrysler 200, with a Quebec licence plate, FGY 1261 (""white car""), and two black men in the front seat. They were Abdullahi, the driver, and Daud Hussein, the front seat passenger. They did not see Khadra Omer who was in the rear seat behind Abdullahi. It was about 4:15 p.m. Fraser believed the white car was a rental, based upon his experience in OPP surveillance. Fraser and DiPietro, who were both driving unmarked police vehicles, followed the white car eastbound to Dixon Road where it exited. While travelling from the Milton area to that exit, Abdullahi and Daud Hussein looked around at other vehicles because they believed they may have been under police surveillance. Abdullahi began to change lanes, accelerating to 130 kms per hour from the normal pace of traffic at the time, about 120 kms per hour. Fraser and DiPietro also exited at Dixon Road. It was about 4:40 p.m. Dixon Road, at that point, is south of the 401 and is, essentially, an east-west road. Just prior to exiting, Fraser radioed for some assistance of marked OPP cruisers. Abdullahi drove the white car eastbound on Dixon Road with Fraser, DiPietro and a marked OPP cruiser behind it. The flashing lights and siren of the cruiser were activated as all of the other vehicles stopped for a red light at the intersection with Chetta Place. It runs north and south. The white car and the unmarked cruisers of DiPietro and Fraser were in the passing lane, not the left turn lane. Suddenly, Abdullahi drove the white car north on Chetta Place, through the red light. It was about 4:45 p.m. He then turned into an apartment complex on the west side of Chetta Place. The entrance to the complex was just north of Dixon Road. The complex related to apartment buildings at 330 Dixon Road and 340 Dixon Road. DiPietro lost sight of the white car, but Fraser did not. Both of them followed the white car into the complex. Fraser and DiPietro took different routes in pursuit of the white car. The white car and Fraser were more to the south of the common area; DiPietro was more to the north. Fraser, however, did briefly lose sight of the white car because of a 4 wall near the entrance to the underground parking for the building. Fraser stopped near the top of the ramp into the parking area. DiPietro arrived there shortly afterwards. Both of them observed some damage to the door to the underground, as if someone had driven through it. Fraser and DiPietro exited their vehicles. They were wearing plainclothes, with an OPP vest and an OPP cap. Both of them carried their OPP rifles as they walked down the ramp, because they had received information that there were some firearms in the white car. Both of them observed the white car parked near a door to a stairwell; it was not situated in a parking stall. It was about 4:55 p.m. There were no people in the car. Abdullahi, Daud Hussein and Khadra Omer had taken flight. The passenger side, the hood and the windshield were damaged. Both of the officers observed a black bag on the front passenger seat. Fraser searched the bag when directed to do so by Detective Landry. Fraser placed it on the trunk. There were three firearms in it, each one in a black sock. One of the items was a Ruger handgun with a clip. The others appeared to be handguns to Fraser. He left the black bag and its contents on the white car, and returned to the top of the ramp to the underground parking, with DiPietro. Fraser advised Landry of the presence of the handguns in the white car. Many police cruisers and uniformed police officers arrived in the area, in an effort to find the occupants of the white car. They stayed there for several hours. DiPietro and Fraser maintained security of the scene at the entrance until about 5:05 p.m. At that time the black bag and its contents were turned over to Detective Purcell, who is a member of the OPP assigned to its Weapons Enforcement Unit. Purcell removed the other two firearms from the black bag. All of them had magazines in them. None of them had ammunition in them. Around 6:40 p.m. he took custody of the black bag and the handguns, and returned to the London Detachment of the OPP.

The offending primarily involved the purchase, sale, and possession of devices and materials used to manufacture forged credit cards. Some offences charged related to participation in a criminal organisation.All four defendants were involved in a business operated through Canadian Barcode and Plastic Card Supply Inc. Canadian Barcode sold devices and software used to transfer data from credit or debit cards onto fraudulent cards. Cattral was the face of the operation to authorities and others, as well as the organization’s technical expert. He also provided technical assistance and advice to customers and suppliers and participated in the marketing and sales of devices. Brunet was responsible for the financial management of the organization and kept the financial records; she was also involved in the marketing and sales of devices and at times provided technical assistance to customers. Beauchamp was dedicated to the sale of the devices, but also provided technical assistance to Canadian Barcode’s customers. One of Canadian Barcode’s primary customers in the credit card skimming endeavour was Ravi Shanghavi. Shanghavi was a lower-level operatives who used the devices sold by Canadian Barcode to acquire data from others’ credit cards, store the data, and transfer the data to counterfeit cards he had manufactured.The charges against the four appellants arose out of a police investigation into the operations of Canadian Barcode, called “Project Instrument”.

"The two accused, both Indian Posse gang members, were occupants of a north end house, 310 Redwood Avenue, in Winnipeg, that was repeatedly visited by the deceased and other members of his gang, the Mob Squad. The home at 310 Redwood Avenue was a drug sales outlet known on the streets as a ""crack shack"". It was under the operation of the Indian Posse, a fact which was known to the Mob Squad. The Mob Squad leader had previously directed the deceased and other gang associates to attend to the crack shack to make an offer to supply the operation with Mob Squad drugs. Their overtures were apparently rebuffed on each occasion. After the second visitation, the residents of 310 Redwood contacted the accused Flett and advised him of the Mob Squad's activities. Mr. Flett subsequently attended to the crack shack as did a number of other Indian Posse members including Michael Guimond. Around 7:00 a.m. on September 4, 2012, the Mob Squad leader, accompanied by Paris Bruce and two other associates, visited 310 Redwood for yet a third time. The Crown related that the foursome ""attended to the house at Redwood and attempted one last time to take over the crack shack"". It was an agreed fact that the person who answered the door was Michael Guimond. A verbal argument ensued. As a result, the Mob Squad group picked up pieces of wood and a rock from a neighboring yard and threw these items in the direction of Mr. Guimond. Apparently one or more pieces of wood that had been thrown ended up inside the residence. Mr. Sawchuk filed photos  which he said depicted minor injuries to Mr. Guimond's arms that had been sustained at this stage of the incident. Almost immediately, Mr. Guimond and several other Indian Posse members ran out of the residence in pursuit of the attacking group. The Mob Squad leader and another recruit escaped in the leader's vehicle. The deceased and one other colleague fled down the lane between Redwood and Aberdeen Avenue.   Mr. Bruce was caught in the lane approximately 100 feet from 310 Redwood by five to seven Indian Posse members including Warner Flett and Michael Guimond. He suffered a severe beating at this time. Michael Guimond admitted to striking the victim a few times at this point, ""at least one of which was while others were also striking the victim and while the victim was on the ground"". Warner Flett also admitted kicking the victim a number of times, ""at least one of which was while others were also striking the victim and while the victim was on the ground"". Flett admitted that the kick delivered when the victim was on the ground was to the victim's head. Notwithstanding his being outnumbered, the victim was able to get to his feet and run into the back yard of a nearby residence at 321 Aberdeen Avenue. Here, in the back yard, he was once again caught by his pursuers who apparently struck him with sticks and stabbed him twice with two different knives. The Crown conceded that it could not say who inflicted the specific injuries sustained during the back yard attack. Upon hearing someone yell, ""Stop, police"", Mr. Guimond, Mr. Flett and some of the other Indian Posse attackers returned to 310 Redwood. At this point it was initially agreed by counsel that the victim made his way through a gate to a side path where he collapsed to the ground and may have been struck in the head ""at least one more time"" by an unknown Indian Posse assailant. It is an agreed fact that Mr. Guimond and Mr. Flett both re-attended to the yard in question shortly after they had gone back to 310 Redwood in an effort to locate a cell phone belonging to Mr. Guimond. At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, when asked by the Crown if he wished to make any comments or remarks on his own behalf, Mr. Flett acknowledged that he had returned to the yard with Mr. Guimond, and continued to beat the victim notwithstanding that Mr. Guimond had tried.",participation in organized criminal group,1

"The two defendants in this case, Giuseppe Ursino and Cosmin Dracea, both located in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada, were co-conspirators in a scheme to import cocaine into, and traffic cocaine within, Canada from Jamaica, Costa Rica, and Dominican Republic. Ursino was alleged to be a ""boss"" within the global criminal organization known as the ‘Ndrangheta, based in Calabria, Italy. An undercover investigation was conducted between 7 May 2014 and 27 May 2015 with the use of an undercover police agent that had formerly been a career criminal. As part of his agreement with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, he was enrolled in a witness protection programme. During the investigation, the police agent arranged to meet with the defendants to discuss methods of cocaine importation into Canada. At these meetings both of the defendants were recorded using audio and video surveillance, which was later used as evidence to convict both of drug related offences, participation in an organized criminal group, as well as possession of proceeds of crime offences.

A judge later described the organization as ‘well organized, well equipped, well financed and highly profitable’.The criminal group was led by Mr Dale Jason Sweeney, who bought the cocaine from suppliers in British Columbia. He then gave the cocaine to members of the Redlined Support Crew, a subsidiary gang of the Hells Angels, who turned the cocaine into crack cocaine and sold it in small quantities to users on the street. This was performed at two properties in Winnipeg. The Hells Angels and the Redlined Support Crew met weekly to exchange profits from their operations. In January 2012, police arrested one of the accused as he was leaving one of these weekly meetings and seized nearly CAD 20,000 in cash. In a later operation in February 2012, police seized one kilogram of cocaine.At 7AM on 16 March 2012, more than 150 Winnipeg officers raided the properties of a number of Hells Angels’ members and associates. Search warrants were executed at six addresses. Nine people were arrested, including the chapter president, Mr Dale Jason Sweeney, as well as Messrs Roderick (Rod) Patrick Sweeney, Carmine Puteri, Kurtis Donald Scott, Christopher Allan Gerula, Brendin Kyle Wall, Thomas Clinton Barnecki, Jonathon Stewart and Donovan Michael Lafrance. Only four members of the Hells Angels’ Manitoba chapter at the time were not arrested in the raids.Police seized approximately two kilograms of cocaine and an undisclosed amount of cash in the raids. Police also seized a motorcycle owned by Mr Dale Sweeney which was on show at the Winnipeg Convention Centre. A number of items were also seized from Mr Scott’s property during the execution of the search warrant. These included a 2005 Buick Rendezvous sport utility vehicle.On 21 April 2016, Winnipeg police reported that they had arrested a total of 23 men through Project Flatlined, and that four further men were wanted on arrest warrants in relation to the operation: Messrs Shawn Justin Colbert, Adam Matthew Wood, Jared James Irving and Jesse Richard Thomas. Mr Colbert turned himself in at police headquarters the following day. Mr Wood was arrested in Crestview, Winnipeg on 23 April 2016.Mr Irving was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on 1 June 2012 after being pulled over by police at a traffic stop in Headingley, Manitoba, bringing the total number of arrested persons to 25.Mr Thomas was the last remaining person wanted in connection to Project Redlined.

"The two accused in this case were members of a street gang called the ‘Young Buck Killas', also known as ‘the YBK’. The principal aims and objectives of this gang included committing robberies and producing and trafficking drugs, principally crack cocaine. The YBK was founded in Toronto but had extended its activities other cities in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia.The modus operandi of the organized criminal group was to rent houses in these cities from which persons lower in the criminal hierarchy would sell crack cocaine. Members of the group transported drugs and sometimes firearms between these cities on inter-city busses.",drug offences,1
"Project Flatlined involved a 10 month investigation beginning in May 2011 into the criminal activities of members of the Manitoba chapter of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club and the Redlined Support Crew. The Redlined Support Crew was a subsidiary group of the Hells Angels in Manitoba formed to provide ‘street-level enforcement’ for the Hells Angels in a dispute with another motorcycle gang, Rock Machine, over territory for drug trafficking in Manitoba. The dispute had been ongoing since early 2010. The two warring gangs had been involved in a number of violent conflicts, including drive-by shootings, firebombings and physical assaults. Project Flatlined ultimately led to the arrest of 25 members of the Hells Angels and Redlined and associates of these clubs in relation to the criminal operation involved in this case, with charges being laid against 16 of those people. At least 9 of these 16 people were successfully convicted. Information about the criminal proceedings against the other 7 people was not available at the time of writing. In relation to the 9 people not charged with criminal offences, sureties to keep the peace were successfully obtained in relation to at least 6 of these people. Information about whether sureties were successfully obtained against the other 3 was not available at the time of writing.The organized criminal group in this case was involved in trafficking between one and two kilograms of cocaine every month between May 2011 and February 2012 in Winnipeg, primarily in Elmwood.

"In the fall of 2010, the Edmonton Police Service received information that a condominium rental unit in south Edmonton was being used to process powdered cocaine into crack cocaine and that this location (referred to later as Unit 103) was also being used to store the cash proceeds of cocaine sales. On October 12, 2010 the Edmonton Police service installed a pen camera in the hallway to monitor who was accessing Unit 103. At no time did the police place any hallway cameras such that the interior of Unit 103 was in any way displayed. As a result of hallway camera surveillance, police were able to identify a number of individuals that they had previously dealt with, specifically individuals involved in the illegal drug trade. Hallway surveillance revealed that on October 12, 2010, the Accused and Peter Tran entered Unit 103 for approximately seven minutes and that the Accused was carrying a key which he used to lock the door on.Given the information obtained from hallway video surveillance, coupled with other information the police had in their possession, an application was made for a warrant permitting covert entry into Unit 103. The warrant was granted and the initial police covert entry into Unit 103 was made on October 14, 2010. Several police officers who participated in the initial covert entry testified with the aid of the video and photographs. A thorough search was conducted and what was believed to be cocaine was located inside the oven adjacent to the lower oven drawer, which was not in plain view. As well, a large amount of cash was found inside the oven and several bags, but again none of the cash was in plain view. Items believed to be cocaine were found both in powder form and base form, also known as rock or crack cocaine.  In addition, a loaded handgun and ammunition were located inside a black sock which was inside the washing machine, not in plain view. As well, police observed a money counter along with a garbage bag containing what appeared to be wrappers for kilos of cocaine. No seizures were made at that time although samples were taken of what was suspected to be cocaine. Subsequent analysis confirmed that the samples were indeed cocaine. Following the covert entry hallway surveillance continued. On October 24, 2010 the Accused was observed entering Unit 103 with a key. This was the last time that the Accused was observed entering Unit 103 up to the termination of this investigation and his arrest on December 23, 2010.",drug offences,1
"In early September, 2009 the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary (RNC) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) commenced a comprehensive investigation known as Operation Razorback. The targets to the investigation were Peter BlokAndersen, Ben Strongitharm, Zach Hill, Evan Brennan-Smith, Ricco Zanolli, Jacob Hauge and Andrew Green. During the various sneak and peek operations police observed and videotaped both drugs and money in varying quantities and amounts; changes to the composition of the drugs and money occurred after entry by Ben Strongitharm, Evan Brennan-Smith, Zach Hill, Jacob Hauge and Ricco Zanolli. Additionally, police, acting under warrant, discovered monies were being transferred or received by named targets or others associated with them. Certain of the targets were observed meeting with individuals known by police to be involved in the drug trade.  In January, 2010, after observing Evan Brennan-Smith complete a sale of 1 kilo of cocaine, police entered a residential dwelling situate at 224 Anchorage Road, Conception Bay South, Newfoundland and Labrador. This house was located within two miles, approximately, of the arrest of Brennan-Smith and the other party.

"The charges arise out of a Toronto Police Services (""TPS"") investigation called Project Marvel which took place between September 1 and December 13, 2011 and events that transpired during that period. Project Marvel arose out of a number of shootings which took place in the Driftwood Court area of Toronto in the spring of 2011. Driftwood Court is located east of Jane Street, in the area north of Finch and south of Steeles Avenue. The investigation involved multiple wiretaps and police surveillance culminating on December 13, 2011 with the execution of a numerous search warrants and a large number of arrests. The Crown alleges that Gardner was part of a street gang that called itself the YBK and that was principally engaged in the production, supply and sale of controlled drugs, particularly cocaine, in, among other places, Toronto and Hamilton in Ontario and Surrey in British Columbia (B.C.).  The Crown's case against Gardner is based on numerous intercepted phone conversations, as well as pictures and videos found on cell phones seized from numerous individuals, police surveillance of Gardner and others during the period of the investigation and certain agreed facts. Gardner did not testify and called no other evidence in his defence. Gardner pled guilty of some or all of the charges (15 counts).",drug offences,1
"The charges against the appellants arose out of an extensive police investigation labelled Project XXX into the Doomstown Crips (also known as the Doomztown Crips or Jamestown Crips). The Doomstown Crips was an alleged criminal gang operating in the Rexdale neighbourhood of the City of Toronto. The four appellants, S.L., S.R., R.C. and V.B. C., were alleged to be distributing drugs and firearms to the Doomstown Crips. They were not suspected of being gang members.  The appellant Alvarez was alleged to be a member of the Doomstown Crips. The Project XXX investigation began in November 2005. Lucas was the initial suspect. He was implicated by a gun smuggler from the United States, Earl Cooke, who identified S.L. as someone who had purchased 110 firearms from him between October 2002 and October 2003. By 2006, the police had only recovered 20 of the firearms. Nine of these recovered guns were linked, directly or indirectly, to the Doomstown Crips. The appellants S.R., R.C. and V.B. C. were targeted for investigation because of their association with S.L.. Police surveillance in January 2006 revealed S.L. leaving S.R.'s residence with a knapsack containing three pipe-shaped objects the police believed to be firearms. On February 13, 2006, police obtained a wiretap authorization under s. 186(1.1) of Part VI of the Criminal Code to intercept private communications of a large number of people including the appellants, S.L. and Alvarez. The authorization was issued by Echlin J. In support of the February 13, 2006 Part VI wiretap authorization, the police filed an Information to Obtain (“ITO”), sworn by Detective Vander Heyden, which consists of more than 1000 pages plus lengthy appendices. Included in the ITO was information that the police obtained from two confidential informants. On March 31, 2006, the initial Part VI authorization was extended in time and expanded in scope. In addition to the wiretap authorizations, the police also obtained three general warrants pursuant to s. 487.01 of the Criminal Code. The general warrants were issued on February 16 and 24, 2006 by Taylor J. and on March 31, 2006 as part of the Part VI authorization issued by Echlin J. The February 16 general warrant authorized covert entry into 20 residences and eight motor vehicles. Among other things, the officers were authorized to copy documents, photograph or seize weapons and controlled substances, examine or record data contained in cellular telephones and covertly retrieve keys. The February 16 warrant was used to search S.L.’s vehicle on March 21, 2006 and his residence on March 25. It was also used to search R.C.'s residence on March 22, during which police observed, but did not seize, a significant quantity of U.S. and Canadian cash. The February 24 general warrant authorized the police to enter a storage locker at a public storage site at 389 Paris Road in Brantford. The search of the locker, conducted on February 25, 2006, revealed that it contained guns, ammunition, drugs, and a box containing 1 kg of cocaine. The box had a label with R.C.'s home address on it. The March 31 general warrant was embedded in the wiretap authorization issued by Echlin J. It authorized the surreptitious entry of a large number of places and vehicles belonging to the appellants or persons associated with them. The March 31 warrant was used to search S.L.’s residence on April 29. The police also executed the general warrant on R.C.'s residence on April 8 and seized approximately $64,000 in cash, a money counter, and other items.  V.B.C.'s vehicle was searched without a warrant on May 16, 2006. During this search the police seized a laptop bag containing $17,000 in cash. Arrest and search warrants were executed on May 18, 2006 (the “take-down warrants”). The take-down warrants authorized the police to enter the premises of a large number of individuals, including the appellants, without knocking or giving notice to the occupants, in order to effect the arrests of the individuals named in the warrants and to search the premises. Pursuant to the take-down warrants, the police arrested 102 persons, including the five appellants, in the early morning hours during dynamic no-knock entries. During the search of R.C.'s residence, police found $20,000 in cash and marijuana. During the search of V.B.C.'s residence, the police found $6,195 cash in the possession of another male, a safe containing $2,000 in cash, a money counter, several cell phones, and a document believed to be a debt list. During the search of S.R.'s residence, police seized $3530 and US$450, a money counter, and numerous cell phones. S.R. also had $1,000 on his person when he was arrested. The search of Lucas’ residence revealed numerous cell phones, a money counter, and a hollowed-out book that had been seen to contain cash during a covert entry into his residence on March 25. S.L., S.R., R.C. and V.B. C. were charged with various firearms and/or drug-related offences on a 29-count indictment. Alvarez was charged together with six co-accused on a 126-count indictment.",drug offences,1

"A police investigation, ""Operation Piranha"", revealed that Mr. Louis-Alain Dauphin was operating a large drug-trafficking network in Montreal, Canada. In October 2005, the police made two large seizures of cocaine from the homes of two accomplices of Dauphin. Following this, Dauphin turned to the defendant, Mr. Carmelo Venneri, for assistance, as his previous source refused to supply him with additional cocaine. It was then that Venneri, who had, since 13 July 2005, regularly purchased drugs from Dauphin for the purpose of trafficking, began to supply Dauphin with cocaine. A trial judge later noted that at this point of time, Venneri became ""an important pillar"" in securing Dauphin's supply. This arrangement ended on 14 March, 2006, when Venneri was arrested following a search of his home, where the police seized, among other things, nine grams of cocaine, a firearm, and a large sum of cash.",drug offences,1

"Ms T.C. was seventeen years old when she worked as an escort for Mr Tynes and Mr Lafferty in November and December 2009 and again for a few days in January 2010. Ms M.P. was also seventeen years old while she worked as an escort for the accused in January 2010. It was stated in the sentencing judgment that “neither accused used overt threats or violence to coerce T.C. and M.P. to work as escorts, but Mr Lafferty had a continuous intimate relationship with T.C. during the whole time she worked as an escort” [R v. Myles Tynes and Philip Lafferty [2010] Q.J. No. 13355 at 10]. The Honourable Pierre E.

The clients were dispatched by a telephone operator to the location of the escorts;- Even if they were equipped with cellular telephones, there was no immediate measure to protect the complainants whiles they were working.

"Organized Criminal Group Involved: The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club- Based on Expert Opinion of Detective Sargeant Ken Davis, as of November 17th, 2006 police intelligence shows that The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club of Canada consisted of 467 full-patch members, 58 prospects and approximately 50 hang-arounds- General Modus Operandi : the facilitation or commission of serious criminal offences, likely resulting in the direct or indirect receipt of a material benefit, including a financial benefit, by the group or by any of the persons who constitute the group, whether in or outside of Canada- Types of Crime the Hells Angels Usually Engage In, include, inter alia, the following:(i) Trafficking in Illicit Drugs, primarily cocaine and other drugs;(ii) Trafficking in Firearms;(ii) Murder(iii) Attempt Murder(iv) Extortion(v) Money Laundering(vi) Illicit Gambling;(vii) Bombings(viii) Property Related offences- Characteristics of the Hell Angels as an Outlaw Motorcycle Club, both Nationally and Internationally, include, inter alia, the following:(i) Hierarchical Structure (such as physical corporate organizational lists)(ii) Membership (such as carrying cards and HA jewellery paraphernalia and a strict and lengthy probation term to become a full-patch member, from a hang-around, prospect and finally a member)(iii) Club Rules(iv) Colours (such as the Hells Angels patch, skull with wings)(v) Clubhouses(vi) Counter-Intelligence Gathering against the police (as is evidenced by the physical seizure of sensitive internal police documents seized from the Hells Angels’ Clubhouses and in the homes of full-patch members in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada(vii) Associates; and(viii) Criminal Activities(i) Factual Summary Of the Hells Angels as An Outlaw Motorcycle ClubThe Hells Angels are a highly-structured group which is deliberately organized to facilitate the commission of criminal offences by and among its members, in particular, the trafficking of drugs.Members of the Hells Angels belong to individual chapters or “Charters”, and must abide by the rules set by the Hells Angels. In Ontario, Hells Angels members are governed by world rules, Canada-wide rules, and Ontario rules. The rules create an environment within which Hells Angels members can carry out criminal activity free from detection by the police. For example, membership is tightly controlled, so that only trusted individuals with no connection to law enforcement can join. Potential members are carefully screened and only permitted to become “full-patch” members after first being a “Hangaround”, then a “Prospect”. In order to become a “Hangaround”, an individual must be systematically involved in crime. “Prospects” are actively involved in criminal activities and are on probation for a period of one to two years. The transition from “Hangaround” to “Prospect” status, and from “Prospect” status to “full-patch” member, can only occur if 100% of the members approve of the change. New members must be sponsored by a full-patch member and are under probation for one year. Photographs of members are distributed to all chapters in Canada to avoid infiltration by police undercover officers.Other rules facilitate the commission of crime by members of the Hells Angels. No person who has ever been in law enforcement, or who has ever taken steps to become a police officer or prison guard, is permitted to be a member. Members must abide by a strict “no snitching” rule, which prevents them from even reporting to the police that they have been a victim of crime at the hands of another. The Hells Angels also have a strict “no rips” rule, which helps to ensure that individuals can enter into drug-related business with members of the Hells Angels without fear of being the victim of a drug “rip-off”, and thereby enhances the ability of Hells Angels members to engage in drug-related activity.Individuals are not permitted to become members of the Hells Angels until they have demonstrated their loyalty and trustworthiness to the criminal organization. Once members, they are considered to be club “brothers” who will assist each other in criminal endeavours when called on.Members of the Hells Angels also know that if there is a dispute or conflict among members, other members will step in to mediate or arbitrate the dispute. Criminal activity conducted between members is not carried out in isolation from their membership in the Hells Angels; rather, members know that if a dispute arises, the Hells Angels will actively intervene and mediate the dispute.In addition to the rules and highly-structured organization of the Hells Angels which facilitate the commission of offences by club members, individual chapters of the Hells Angels operate secure, fortified clubhouses within which members can meet to engage in criminal activity.(ii) Factual and Legal Summary of the Instant Case, R. v. DrecicThe accused, Zavisa Drecic (“Drecic’), was a full-patch member of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, a criminal organization notorious for facilitating the commission of criminal offences by its members. Drecic was a party to a number of drug transactions with another full-patch member of the Hells Angels, David Atwell (“Atwell”), who also happened to be a police agent, who had been wired with a judicially authorized recording device. Although Drecic admitted to drug trafficking, he denied that the trafficking had been committed in association with the Hells Angels.The trial judge, however, found as a fact that Drecic had committed the offences because he knew Atwell to be a fellow member of the Hells Angels who could be relied on and trusted in that capacity. The trial judge, therefore, concluded that the Appellant had committed the offences “in association with” the Hells Angels and convicted him under section 467.12(1) of the Criminal Code.Under section 467.12(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada, courts in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada have held that an offence is committed “in association with” a criminal organization, if there is a sufficient connection or linkage between the offence and the criminal organization. In the instant case, the trial judge was aware that the Crown needed to establish a connection between the commission of the offences and the Hells Angels, and he was satisfied on all the evidence that there was a connection sufficient to make out the offence.In the case at bar, the trial judge held that to assess whether a drug transaction is conducted “in association with” a criminal organization, there are four factors, outlined below, that must be examined, having regard to all of the surrounding circumstances:1. the nature of the criminal transaction;2. the nature of the relationship between the parties to the criminal transaction;3. the relationship between the parties and the alleged criminal organization;and4. the nature of the alleged criminal organization, its structure and its business",drug offences,0
"The defendant in this case was the leader of an organized criminal group involved in drug trafficking. He was accused of operating a drug ring out of a hotel bar in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. The drugs (heroin and cocaine) were supposedly transferred by couriers from off-site locations, such as hotels and motels rented by the defendant, to ‘stash rooms’ in the hotel, where they were then prepared and packaged for individual sale. The defendant hired employees to oversee the sales, and he personally maintained supervisory control of the organization through frequent telephone contact and personal attendance at the hotel. The alleged drug business centred on small quantity but high-volume sales, with about 10 sales of cocaine or heroin taking place per hour for about USD 10 per transaction. The indictment alleged that there was a total of 21 co-conspirators.The defendant was charged on a multi-count indictment under s 467.13 of the Canadian Criminal Code, RSC 1985 c C-46.Count 1 accused Mr Terezakis of being part of a ‘criminal organization whose members included… three or more…persons … between the 4th day of February, 2002 and the 7th day of August, 2003, at or near the Cities of Vancouver, Surrey, Coquitlam, Abbotsford and places elsewhere in the Province of British Columbia’. It was alleged that the Defendant ‘knowingly [instructed] directly or indirectly any person including any member of that criminal organization, to commit the indictable offences of trafficking in the controlled substances of cocaine and diacetylmorphine (heroin) contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act for the benefit of the said criminal organization contrary to section 467.13 of the Criminal Code of Canada’. The indictment also charged Mr Terezakis jointly or solely with various offences on 15 other counts, including conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and heroin, trafficking in cocaine and heroin, offences related to assault and unlawful confinement.",drug offences,1

In Ontario, Hells Angels members are governed by world rules, Canada-wide rules, and Ontario rules. The rules create an environment within which Hells Angels members can carry out criminal activity free from detection by the police. For example, membership is tightly controlled, so that only trusted individuals with no connection to law enforcement can join. Potential members are carefully screened and only permitted to become “full-patch” members after first being a “Hangaround”, then a “Prospect”. In order to become a “Hangaround”, an individual must be systematically involved in crime. “Prospects” are actively involved in criminal activities and are on probation for a period of one to two years. The transition from “Hangaround” to “Prospect” status, and from “Prospect” status to “full-patch” member, can only occur if 100% of the members approve of the change. New members must be sponsored by a full-patch member and are under probation for one year. Photographs of members are distributed to all chapters in Canada to avoid infiltration by police undercover officers.Other rules facilitate the commission of crime by members of the Hells Angels. No person who has ever been in law enforcement, or who has ever taken steps to become a police officer or prison guard, is permitted to be a member. Members must abide by a strict “no snitching” rule, which prevents them from even reporting to the police that they have been a victim of crime at the hands of another. The Hells Angels also have a strict “no rips” rule, which helps to ensure that individuals can enter into drug-related business with members of the Hells Angels without fear of being the victim of a drug “rip-off”, and thereby enhances the ability of Hells Angels members to engage in drug-related activity.Individuals are not permitted to become members of the Hells Angels until they have demonstrated their loyalty and trustworthiness to the criminal organization. Once members, they are considered to be club “brothers” who will assist each other in criminal endeavours when called on.Members of the Hells Angels also know that if there is a dispute or conflict among members, other members will step in to mediate or arbitrate the dispute. Criminal activity conducted between members is not carried out in isolation from their membership in the Hells Angels; rather, members know that if a dispute arises, the Hells Angels will actively intervene and mediate the dispute.In addition to the rules and highly-structured organization of the Hells Angels which facilitate the commission of offences by club members, individual chapters of the Hells Angels operate secure, fortified clubhouses within which members can meet to engage in criminal activity.(ii) Factual and Legal Summary of the Instant Case, R. v. WagnerThe accused, Kenneth Wagner (“Wagner’), was a high-ranking, full-patch member of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club – Niagrara Chapter, a criminal organization notorious for facilitating the commission of criminal offences by its members. Wagner was a party to a number of cocaine transactions and a gun transaction with another full-patch member of the Hells Angels, Steven Gault (“Gault”), who also happened to be a police agent, who had been wired with a judicially authorized recording device. Although Wagner admitted to cocaine trafficking on several occasions in excess of 4 kilograms, he denied that he instructed others to commit the offence of trafficking in cocaine and transferring a firearm for the benefit of the criminal organization, the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club.As an executive member of the Hells Angels' Oshawa Chapter, Mr. Steven Gault became a police agent. In the summer of 2005, that agent, Steven Gault, contacted Mr. Gerald Ward who is the President of the Niagara Chapter of the Hells Angels. Gault spoke directly to Gerald Ward about purchasing a kilogram of cocaine from Ward. It was agreed that since the Oshawa Chapter owed a drug debt to Mr. Ward of the Niagara Chapter, that Mr. Gault would pay a premium of $2,000 on top of the cost of purchasing the kilogram of cocaine to work down the debt owed by the Oshawa Chapter by Mr. Ward of the Niagara Chapter.On August 18, 2005, Mr. Gault attended in Niagara and paid $42,000 directly to Mr. Ward. Ward then arrange to have Mr. Wagner, a full patch member of the Hells Angels, to arrange for the cocaine to be delivered by Hells Angels associates, prospects or hangarounds.In the first transaction, Mr. Wagner arranged to have a Mr. Muise deliver the drugs. This procedure was followed on four separate occasions.On October 5, 2005, Gault purchased from Ward a kilo of cocaine for $38,000. Mr. Wagner arranged to have a Mr. Lacroix and Mr. Muise deliver the drugs.Again on January 11, 2006, Mr. Ward sold the drugs for $38,000. Again, Ward got the money and Mr. Wagner was left to arrange delivery and he had Lacroix and Muise deliver the drugs on that date.In February of 2006, there was another kilogram transaction. Again Mr. Ward was the one receiving the money, Mr. Wagner arranged to have Mr. Beaulieu deliver the drugs and Mr. Wagner received the $400 in cash for the 48 calibre magnum handgun that was transferred. The other cash money for the cocaine went directly to Ward.The last transaction in drug trafficking took place on August 16, 2006, where 10 ounces of drugs were trafficked for the Harley Davidson motorcycle.In total the police agent purchased 4.38 kilograms of cocaine, that on average was 91 percent pure. He also purchased a handgun for $400 and the cocaine totalling $156,000 plus a Harley Davidson motorcycle.On all of these transactions, Mr. Ward was the person who set the price, discussed the deal and received the money. Wagner was the person who directed other prospect members and associates of the Hells Angels, namely Muise, Lacroix and Beaulieu, to commit the offences of actually delivering the drugs physically and the firearm to Mr. Gault.Based upon the wiretaps, the trial judge convicted Mr. Wagner under section 467.13 of the Criminal Code of Canada. The trial judge found the following:• Ward is the person who was in command. He is the one who made the arrangement and set the price. It is Mr. Wagner's involvement, he admits he is a full patch member of the Hells Angels who then made the necessary arrangements to have those drugs delivered.• that Mr. Wagner would be number two in the hierarchy of these various drug transactions, although he made a point of not touching the drugs but simply making the arrangements. As a full-patch member, he was insulated from those who actually had to carry out the delivery.• When the police arrested Mr. Wagner on September 28, 2006, he was found in possession of $150,675 in cash. He also has acknowledged that the truck he owned and the motorcycle were also proceeds of crime and he fairly has conceded that they should be forfeited to Her Majesty the Queen.• that these gun and drug transactions were not simply committed between individuals, but that Wagner instructed Muise, Beaulieu and Lacroix to traffic in these drugs and transfer the firearm for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with the Hells Angels, which the trial judge found to be a criminal organization.",drug offences,0
"The accused is a Spanish national being tried for conspiracy to import cocaine in Canada. The Crown has moved to introduce in evidence certain items found aboard the Pacifico after it was arrested some 100 nautical miles in international waters and brought to port in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on February 2, 1994.Since the early 1990's and up to February 1994, an R.C.M.P. investigation (Code named ""Operation Jules"") had been gathering information which had provided it with reasonable and probable grounds to believe that many of the co-conspirators named in the present indictment namely, Pierino Divioto, Mike Divito, Roberto Sorenti, Eusèbe Gauvin, François Gauvin, Alfredo Chierchia, Raymond LeBlanc and Pierre Duguay and others were about to import a large quantity of drugs in Canada. In fact, the intelligence gathered and surveillance being effected was such that co-conspirators were being followed and monitored as they made their way to the Shelburne, N.S. area with the necessary equipment to effect their purpose.On February 21st and 22nd, 1994, it was obvious to the authorities that Sorenti, François Gauvin, Chierchia, Duguay, and the Divitos were looking for a vessel to meet a larger vessel somewhere at sea in order to receive a shipment of drugs and that the Lady Teri-Anne was secured for that purpose. The Canadian authorities also believed that Raymond LeBlanc, a Canadian citizen, was on board the vessel about to meet the Lady Teri-Anne and that his task was to ensure the orderly transfer of drugs onto the Lady Teri-Anne. In fact, the R.C.M.P. had obtained the necessary consent from the Attorney General of Canada pursuant to s. 477.3(3) of the Criminal Code of Canada on February 18, 1994 anticipating that they would soon have to exercise the power of arrest, entry, search and seizure outside Canada's territory and in relation to Raymond LeBlanc on board a foreign vessel and in international waters.At 2 :06 Hrs., according to the Canadian authorities' radar tracking, the Lady Teri-Anne stopped within 160 feet of another vessel which appeared from the south and both vessels, from that point in time, ""remained dead in the water for a period of approximately 25 minutes"". At 2 :22 Hrs., the Lady Teri-Anne broke from the other vessel and proceeded in the direction of the Shelburne wharf while the other vessel turned south-east in the direction of the open sea. It should be said now that the other vessel turned out to be the Pacifico, a large vessel registered in Cyprus, whose captain was Jürgen Kirchhoff.Canadian authorities either followed or radar tracked the Pacifico continuously from the time it broke off from the Lady Teri-Anne at 2 :22 Hrs. until the Pacifico was arrested. At 11:59 Hrs., the H.M.C.S. Terra Nova (the Canadian military vessel which had followed and kept track of the Pacifico's location at all times and was waiting for instructions) received instructions from Canadian authorities to proceed to the arrest of the Pacifico. At that time, the two vessels were some 18 miles apart. At 12 :58 Hrs., the Terra Nova approached within three miles of the Pacifico. The commanding officer of the Terra Nova called the Pacifico and informed it that R.C.M.P. officers were on board and that they suspected that the captain of the Pacifico had a Canadian citizen on board which the Canadian authorities thought to be involved in a conspiracy to import narcotics in Canada. It is now conceded by the Crown that no such suspicion existed as Raymond LeBlanc had in fact been arrested in Shelburne. It is also conceded by the Crown that the only reason which in fact brought about the pursuit and the subsequent arrest of the Pacifico was the rendez-vous between the two vessels and the reasonable belief by the Canadian authorities that the Lady Teri-Anne had obtained a cargo of illicit drugs transferred from the Pacifico onto the Lady Teri-Anne for importation into Canada. The Pacifico was then boarded and escorted to Nova Scotia while Canadian authorities requested authorisation from Cypress to board, search and exercise jurisdiction should evidence of involvement in narcotics trafficking be found.",drug offences,0
"During the winter of 1992, members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Gander Subdivision, Drug Section, began to conduct an investigation into the possible importation of a large amount of cannabis resin into Canada through the Province of Newfoundland. The investigation involved the utilization of court authorizations to intercept private communications as well as other technical and physical surveillance. During 1992 and the spring and summer of 1993, a Daniel John Cosgrove, with the assistance of James Edwin Melvin, recruited Ricky Anthony Parsons to assist them and others in landing a multi-ton shipment of narcotics that were expected to arrive by sea. Parsons was the owner of a fishing boat known as the 'Cutknife II' and Cosgrove wanted Parsons to meet another boat, which would be carrying the narcotics, to bring them into Trinity Bay. On October 27, 1993, Parsons and his crew piloted their boat to prearranged co-ordinates where they met a boat called the 'Quidam Gaspe'. Crew members on the 'Quidam Gaspe' signalled in recognition of the 'Cutknife II' and proceeded to follow the 'Cutknife II' to Deer Harbour, Trinity Bay. The 'Quidam Gaspe' had approximately 26 tons of cannabis resin (hashish) on board with a ""street"" value of $500,000,000. The drugs were then transferred by crew members of both vessels to other points in Trinity Bay and subsequently loaded on to trucks for transportation to Montreal. On October 30th, 1993, the R.C.M.P. in the Provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Quebec arrested 13 persons and charged them with conspiracy to traffic in cannabis resin for their involvement in the scheme. The hashish, as well as other items including navigation equipment and cellular telephones were seized by the authorities. Ovide Cyr was the captain of the ""Quidam Gaspe"" and Hilaire Cyr was one of its seven crew members. After his arrest, Ovide Cyr admitted to the police that he was the captain of the boat and that his brother, Hilaire, was a crew member. Ovide told police that he was to be paid $700,000 by the organizers of the conspiracy to take his boat from Quebec to meet a 'mothership' and to transport the drugs to Newfoundland. He told police that he estimated that each of the bags or bales of hashish weighed about 20 pounds and he thought he had at least 10 or 15 tons of hashish on board his boat. He also told police that they would find the co-ordinates for the rendezvous point with the 'mothership' marked on the maps which were left in the cabin of the 'Quidam Gaspe'. Hilaire Joseph Cyr, after his arrest by members of the Royal Canadian MountedPolice, told investigators that his brother, Ovide, was the captain of the ship and that he and the other crew members had left St. Therese, Quebec, three weeks ago. He told police that each crew member would get $300,000 for his work and also stated that they met the 'mothership' from which the drugs were transferred at a point somewhere south of Bermuda and stated that the hashish was wrapped in 20 kilogram bags with each bag worth approximately $250,000 and that there were approximately 1,000 of them on the boat. He recited his work history to the police and how he had been all across Canada. He then stated that he was now trafficking in dope and would have to go to jail. He said there were 53,000 pounds of hashish on board the boat.",drug offences,0
"Jariabka Juraj met Victim 1 a freelance journalist in Slovakia through a third party. This introduction occurred as Mr Juraj planned to request that Victim 1 travel to Hong Kong to incorporate two companies and establish bank accounts for them. Following these actions he would then transfer ownership to the third party and be paid EUR 5,000. In order for plans to be established, further meetings took place during which Victim 1 was told that the businesses were illegal although not criminal. Victim 1 began to secretly record the meetings with a hidden camera following this occurrence. He planned to go along with the plans in order to report the criminal activity.On 14 May 2013, Mr Juraj and Victim 1 arrived in Hong Kong in order for Victim 1 to carry out the activities that had been planned. Victim 1 went to Acorn Business Services, a consultancy business and commercial service provider, and requested that two companies, Vindex (HK) Ltd and East Ray (HK) Ltd, be incorporated. He was then supposed to open bank accounts for both companies. However, to avoid criminal liability, he provided excuses to Mr Juraj that the banks required proof of business. Upon returning to Slovakia under the guise of preparing documentation, Victim 1 reported the matter to the Slovakian police who declined to investigate. Victim 1 alternative plan was to return to Hong Kong where he would report the matter to the Hong Kong police. At a pre-arranged meeting at which Victim 1 identified Mr Juraj, he was arrested.",money laundry,1
"Mr Carson Yeung Ka Sing was involved in a number of offences of dealing with property believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence. He was born in 1960, the son of a vegetable stall business owner. He was 54 at the time of the offending. His education had involved a hairdresser apprenticeship which included travel to London and Paris. His apprenticeship would be put to use in order to generate significant income, however there were other notable sources of income. The defendant opened five hair salons on his return to Hong Kong in 1988 over a period of six years. Each salon cost HKD 1–4 million to establish. The salons catered to the wealthy, allegedly earning the defendant HKD 1–3 million – although this was disproved at the trial. The defendant was involved in share trading, first establishing a share trading account in 1978 when he was 18 years old. His first trades involved sums of between HKD 100,000 and HKD 200,000 despite his income only amounting to HKD 10,000 per month from hairdressing. In 1986, the defendant's share trading became very profitable and he had a portfolio worth between HKD 1 and HKD 3 million in shares. Gambling was another source of income, resulting in HKD 62 million dollars being deposited into his account in 1997, which he stated was won from gambling. This was not, however, corroborated.Even with these various alleged sources of income, which were found to be questionable during the trial, the defendant was not able to explain the source of HKD 721,287,607 which had been deposited into five separate accounts owned by him. The large sum of unexplained funds led to an investigation by the Hong Kong police leading to his arrest in 2011. The fact that records demonstrated that he had a relatively small income compounded the allegations of money laundering and he was arrested on the grounds that he had dealt with property believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence, these offences occurring between 2001 and 2007.Mr Yeung Ka Sing was convicted in the District Court of Hong Kong of five offences of dealing with property believed to represent the proceeds of an indictable offence contrary to s 25 of the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455), for which he was sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment. He appealed against his conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong, where his appeals were dismissed. He appealed the dismissal of his appeal against conviction to the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong, which was also unsuccessful.",money laundry,1
"After the 2008 collapse of the Bank Century, a public bank in Indonesia, the bank was taken over by the Indonesian government through Bank Indonesia and renamed Bank Mutiara. The first four defendants (D1, D2, D3 and D4) of the case were alleged to have illegally caused the collapse in order to enrich themselves and certain third persons. The Central Jakarta District Court issued three restraint orders in October 2009, and March and July 2010, ordering the restraint of the overseas bank accounts of the four defendants (some of which were located in Hong Kong) pending a final decision on the confiscation of assets.At the request of the Indonesian government, the Secretary for Justice (“the Secretary”) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (“the HKSAR”) applied to the Court of First Instance of the HKSAR for an order to restrain the bank accounts of the defendants in Hong Kong. On 15 December 2010, a restraint order was issued prohibiting the defendants from disposing of, dealing with, or diminishing the value of “any of their property in Hong Kong”.D1 and D2 were tried in absentia in Jakarta and convicted of corruption and money laundering offences. They were ordered to pay restitution of IDR 3,115,889,000. Should they fail to pay, their assets might be seized to satisfy the order.Additionally, the District Court of Central Jakarta issued an order to confiscate the assets and money owned or controlled by D1 to D4.On 26 December 2012, the Indonesian Government made a supplementary request to the Secretary to enforce the above two orders as an external confiscation order pursuant to section 27 of the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance (Chapter 525, Laws of Hong Kong) (“the Ordinance”) and the provisions of the Agreement between the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of the Indonesia Concerning Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters (“the Agreement”).",money laundry,0
"Between May 2002 and December 2005, the defendant, Lam Meiling, used nine personal bank accounts to launder more than 6.8 billion yuan (CNY), which equals over USD 1 billion. The source of these funds is unknown, and the destination of the money after the defendant transferred the money out of her bank accounts could not be traced either. During the three and a half year period of criminal activity, the defendant did not report any income tax and officially did not own any property. She lived in public housing provided by the government.On 16 January 2008, the defendant was arrested by the Commercial Crime Bureau for the crime of money laundering.On 17 June 2011, the defendant accepted a video interview with the police and made the following statements: According to the defendant, the money laundering started when she was instructed by Qin Xia, a female friend who raised the defendant's two children in mainland China, to register as a remittance agent. Under Qin Xia's instructions, Meiling used the relevant bank account to process money on her behalf, without asking about the source of the funds. Meiling received CNY 4,500 (approximately USD 500) from Qin Xia as a monthly payment.In court, the defendant stated that the money was all related to Qin Xia's business in a factory in mainland China, and was deposited by Qin Xia's business partners, and then transferred to the accounts of Qin Xia's other business partners by the defendant.Despite the belief that the defendant did not know of the nature of the funds transferred to her accounts, the court decided that considering the high amount of money involved in the case, the duration of the crime and the number of bank accounts, the defendant was not fully ignorant.",money laundry,1
"The victim P.W.I. was a 17-year-old karaoke bar hostess working in Shenzhen, China. She met the defendant, Mr Yui Sam, at a disco through the introduction of someone known as “Ah Kin”.  Ah Kin told P.W.I., in the presence of the defendant, that it was difficult for her to make money in Shenzhen, whereas in Hong Kong she could make more than a HKD100,000 income each month.  The defendant then asked Ah Kin to explain the details to her.  P.W.I. was told that she would only be required to dance and sing with men and did not have to engage in sexual intercourse.   P.W.I. claimed that she was 20 years old at the time and arrangements were made [it is not clear from the judgment whether the defendant made these arrangements himself] for her to travel to Hong Kong. Upon arrival in Hong Kong on 29 December 2000, P.W.I. met the defendant and he took her to his flat. At the flat, she was given pornographic magazines, told to remove her clothes and to do what was in the magazines as the defendant was going to “teach her how to have sexual intercourse”. He then appears to have engaged in anal sex with P.W.I., which was recorded on video. The video shows P.W.I. crying, saying “that’s enough”, “leave me alone” and “stop”.   The facts indicate that there were the elements of recruiting, harbouring and receiving an individual through deception and abuse of power/position of vulnerability for the purpose of sexual exploitation/exploitation for prostitution.",other crimes,1
"The two defendants in this case smuggled migrants into Hong Kong from the Mainland China by sea. Defendant 1 was introduced to the criminal operation by a friend. He was promised a reward of 3,000 RMB if he could transport some South Asians from Mainland to Hong Kong on sea. Defendant 2 served as a temporary crew member for Defendant 1 and helped him transport the migrants for monetary reward.On July 26th, 2019, the defendants steered a speedboat without any navigation lights on, which prompted the marine police to approach for investigation. When the police signalled the speedboat to stop, it picked up speed and began to flee. After a chase, the police intercepted the speedboat.On board, the officers found the two defendants and three irregular migrants from Bangladesh. None of the migrants were wearing any lifesaving equipment. A subsequent examination revealed that the speedboat had no firefighting appliances, no navigation lights, and not enough lifesaving equipment. The boat was determined not suitable for operation because of those deficiencies.The defendants were subsequently arrested for smuggling-related offenses.",smuggling of migrants,1
"On 13 August 2015, at approximately 20.30, police officers found a vessel* (specifically, a sampan) at the shore of Tuen Tsui (Hong Kong, China).  The vessel had six males (including the defendant) on board.  None of them had any valid identification or travel documents.  The defendant was sitting at the stern and in control of the vessel’s motor.  From the vessel, the Police seized, inter alia, (i) one nylon bag containing around 4 kg of goose barnacles, (ii) six nets, (iii) seven nylon bags, (iv) four dive suits, (v) one life jacket, (vi) one crowbar, (vii) one gyroscope, (viii) two pairs of gloves, and (xix) three snorkels with masks. In his video recorded interview, the defendant claimed that, about 17.30, on 13 August 2015, he conveyed the other 5 persons on board to look for conches.  After 30 to 40 minutes, they reached the location where they were arrested.  They started picking goose barnacles because it was too early in the evening to catch conches.  The dive suits were worn by those who went into the sea. They would have used the crowbar to pry goose barnacles from the rocks.  The defendant also admitted that he had no licence to operate the vessel. On 27 August 2015, the vessel was inspected by a Senior Ship Inspector of the Marine Department.  It was found that no fire-fighting or life-saving appliance was equipped on board. Likewise, no navigation light was fitted on board for night operation.  In conclusion, the vessel was seaworthy, but not suitable for operation. Given that all the other males in the vessel were irregular migrants, the Immigration Department issued corresponding refusal notices thereto. In ascertaining the acts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence as well as the outcome of searches and seizures.  Legal findings: The defendant pled guilty to (i) assisting the passage to Hong Kong of unauthorized entrants (Charge 1), and (ii) endangering the safety of others at sea (Charge 2).The defendant was sentenced to 40 months’ imprisonment. For further details see “Commentary”.  ----* Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"In the early hours of 26 December 2003, the defendant was intercepted while sailing an unlit wooden vessel* (sampan type) into Hong Kong (China) waters, in the direction of Lau Fau Shan (Hong Kong). On board the vessel, in addition to the defendant, was a young woman, who was approximately nine months pregnant. The defendant was the vessel’s “coxswain”. The vessel had no fire fighting equipment, life saving appliances, navigation lights suitable for night operation. Furthermore, it was unsuitable for carrying passengers. The Marine Department’s ship inspector described its hull as being in “in normal condition”. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence. The defendant claimed that he had intended to go to Hong Kong to collect rubbish. He had given the young woman a free ride, with no-one having paid him to undertake the journey. He stated to have bought the vessel in Shenzhen (China mainland) for RMB 2,000.

"The defendant was charged with four offences of trafficking in women contrary to s. 129(1) of the Crimes Ordinance Cap 200 and two charges of living off the immoral earnings of the women trafficked contrary to s. 137(1) of the Crimes Ordinance. The defendant plead guilty to one charge of trafficking in person and one charge of living on earnings of prostitution of others.On April 22, 2012, the police raided the defendant’s premises and arrested the defendant for the offence of “Trafficking in Persons to Hong Kong.” Upon searching the premises, the police found and seized boarding passes, electronic air-tickets, and itinerary receipts belonging to Victim 1 and Victim 2, in addition to some notebooks.The defendant was subsequently interviewed by officers in the presence of a Spanish Interpreter. The defendant was 52 years old and had been running a trading company for 8 years. According to the defendant’s testimony, she had in total arranged four girls, including Victim 1 and Victim 2, to come to Hong Kong and work as sex workers over the course of one and a half years. The defendant received part of their earnings as repayment for travel fees and profit. She kept the air-tickets of the girls and a record of their income.Approximately two months prior to the date of the interview, the defendant arranged Victim 2, upon the request of Victim 2’s aunt, and Victim 1 to travel from Colombia to Hong Kong. The defendant was aware of the fact that they intended to come to Hong Kong to work in prostitution. The defendant contacted Victim 2 by email and asked her to provide a consent letter from her parents to prove that she voluntarily came to Hong Kong to work. The defendant claimed that she lent US$6,000 to Victim 1 and Victim 2 respectively to obtain passports, medical certificates, and air-tickets for them. She also asked her son, who worked in Colombia, to accompany Victim 2 to travel to Hong Kong. After Victim 2 arrived in Hong Kong, the defendant arranged for her to live in Chung King Mansion (a well-known building in Hong Kong that has many independent low-budget hotel and shops inside and often serves as a large gathering place for the ethnic minorities in Hong Kong). Although the victims found the customers themselves, they received help with communicating with customers over the phone from the defendant since they did not speak English. They were also advised by the defendant regarding how much they should charge customers. By the time of the arrest, the defendant had collected about US$3,000 from Victim 1 and about US$2,000 from Victim 2. The victims were adults and they were considered by the Court not to have been confined or otherwise controlled by the defendant.",trafficking in persons,1
"INTERPOL-led operation “Strikeback” targeted online sextortion cases all around the world and led to the arrest of 58 people in the Philippines. The term sextortion describes a form of sexual exploitation in which the authors threaten the release of victims’ sexual information or photos. According to INTERPOL, blackmail requests in the cases investigated range between 500 USD and 15.000 USD.INTERPOL Digital Crime Centre (IDCC) launched the operation in late 2013 and in cooperation with Police Scotland, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Philippines Department of Justice Office of Cybercrime, the UK’s National Crime Agency CEOP Command, the Hong Kong Police Force and the Singapore Police Force. The investigators identified victims in a number of jurisdictions, including  Indonesia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States. Potential victims were also identified in  Australia, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.Among other things, the operation led to the tracing of a criminal organization involved in the death of Daniel Perry. Daniel Perry was a 17-year old Scot who committed suicide by falling from a bridge in July 2013. He had been victim of blackmail operated by a Philippines-based criminal group. The group lured Perry into a Skype sexual encounter and then threatened him to release the images.On 30 April and 1 May 2014, raids in different locations in the Philippines resulted in the arrest of 58 individuals and the seizure of 250 pieces of electronic equipment. The seized devices are likely to lead to the identification of further victims.",cybercrime,0
"On 24 September 2016, the Anti-Transnational Crime Unit (ATCU) of the Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (PNP CIDG), acting upon a tip-off, carried out a raid of a residential building in the Barangay West Crame neighbourhood in San Juan City. During it, the police discovered an illegal arsenal of assault weapons, including grenade launchers, M14 and M16 rifles, as well as ammunition and explosives. The total value of the cache was estimated at 6 million Philippine peso (approx. 124,500 USD).  According to the police chief, these armaments were prepared to be handed over to the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), a militant separatist faction designated as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations for “participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf or in support of”, “supplying, selling or transferring arms and related materiel to” or “otherwise supporting acts or activities of” Al-Qaida. Additionally, the Abu Sayyaf Group is designated as a terrorist organisation by many national governments, including Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States. The police chief noted that, according to their information, Isa's group and some Abu Sayyaf members have been staying in Manila since August 2016 ""to buy a cache of guns, explosive components, and ammunition upon orders of unidentified [Abu Sayyaf Group] commander”. These arms, as per the police reports, were intended to be used to strengthen the ASG forces in Sulu and Basilan provinces, as well as to intensify their kidnapping and bombing operations. The police further noted that most of the seized weapons and ammunition had been traced back to the government arsenal.  During the raid, the police also made an arrest of Mr. Unding Kenneth Isa, an alleged leader of a gun-running syndicate, as well as his three purported accomplices, later identified as Hja Risdimona Isa, Aljamer Akarab Mandih and Hurbin Alhi Sahibul. However, all of them, except for Mr. Unding Kenneth Isa, were released due to lack of evidence, since Mr. Isa was the sole subject of the search warrant.  These facts became the foundation of criminal cases No. 159501-SJ to 159517-SJ that were brought before the Regional Trial Court Branch 264, Pasig City.",trafficking in firearms,1

AAA was 15 years old and BBB was 16 years old when they started working for Sayo. They were introduced to Sayo by other “plaza girls”. Sayo acted as a pimp providing them with male customers for a certain percentage of the profit. The International Justice Mission requested the Philippine police for assistance on the rescue of minors exploited for prostitution in Pasig City. Acting on the request, the police conducted surveillance, confirmed the report and planned an entrapment operation. Police operatives posed as customers at the Pasig Plaza. They were approached by Sayo who asked them if they wanted women and if they wanted 15 year-old girls. The operatives agreed to the offer and the price. Thereafter, they proceeded to the house of defendant Roxas who openly discussed with Sayo the transaction for the evening. After Roxas and Sayo accepted the payment for the room and the girls, they were arrested.",trafficking in persons,1
"The evidence compiled during the investigation shows that the three victims were recruited by a non-identified person who promised them work as waitresses. Instead, the three victims were sexually exploited by the two defendants, who forced them to engage in sexual intercourse with foreign customers in exchange for money.The victims were highly vulnerable. In the case of V.S., she lived with one of the defendants, and she had an unbeatable fear of the defendant, who got angry and threatened her whenever she refused to work. The second and third victims were also very vulnerable as they were in a very difficult financial situation and needed to work in order to be able to pay for their housing.The investigation was initiated by the Chief of the Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Branch of Cebu City Police (CIIB) in collaboration with the NGO “International Justice Mission” (IJM) and the Department of Social Welfare and Development.The Police identified the two defendants and carried out surveillance activities, and prepared a sting operation, which took place on the 24 th October.

"The defendant, together with Jo. M. and conspiring with Sonny Francisco y Bregoli, recruited and transported two children to Manila with the purpose of exploiting their prostitution. Sonny Francisco was found guilty of human trafficking in a parallel case regarding the present incident.The two victims were sisters R.S.P. and Rh.M.S.P., and were 15 and 12 years of age respectively at the time of the crime. The victims stated that Montejo invited them to go to Manila, and that while they were hesitant at first, they decided to go as they were curious about seeing the capital. Jerome Montejo and Jo. M. took the victims to Manila. When they arrived in Manila, they were picked up by Sonny Francisco, who paid for their transport fares. The victims were told that they would stay in Sonny Francisco’s house for a while, and that he would take care of them. The victims testified that it was at that house that they realised that they were to be sold for sex. The victims cried and asked to return home, but they were not allowed to return unless they paid back the transportation expenses. Victim R.S.P. was sold to three customers, with whom she was forced to engage in sexual relations. The victim did not receive any money in exchange. Sonny Francisco tightly guarded the victims, and he and his wife coached the girls on how to engage in prostitution (what clothes to wear, what to say, etc.). The victims also stated that R.S.P. managed to avoid her younger sister’s prostitution, by offering herself instead of her to engage in sexual intercourse.Victim R.S.P. recounted that on her way home from the hotel she had fortuitously ran into her mother –who had been looking for her- at a store in Manila.

"This case initiated after the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) received a letter from the Director of Investigations at the International Justice Mission, informing of the human trafficking activities of the defendant and her accomplices.Upon receiving this information, the Chief of the Anti-Trafficking Division of the NBI assigned agent L.C. the task of conducting an investigation into the alleged illegal activities of the defendant and her cohorts. After obtaining preliminary information, the Executive Officer of the Anti-Trafficking Division decided to set up a covert operation. As part of this operation, agent L.C. contacted the defendant under an assumed name. After a number of communications, the defendant offered to meet with the undercover agent, who was pretending to be “Raymond”, a friend of a foreigner named “Mario” who was interested in buying sex. For this operation, the NBI obtained the assistance of the Immigration and Customs Enforcements of the Homeland Security Department of the United States, who provided them with two Caucasian agents who acted as “Mario” and Mario’s friend “Mitch”.With the assistance of the ICE, the NBI then implemented the sting operation. The defendant met with Raymond (agent L.C.) at a restaurant. The purpose of this meeting was, purportedly, for the defendant to present Raymond with girls, so he could evaluate whether the girls met Mario’s requirements. They were later joined by a man who the defendant introduced as her husband “Jeminy”. The defendant, together with this man, offered Raymond (agent L.C.) three girls for the purpose of prostitution: “L” (whom he was told was 17 years old), “K” (who the defendants said was 15 years old), and “R”. Undercover agent L.C. then told the defendant that the girls met Mario’s requirements, and agreed to pay the defendants 80,000 PHP for five girls for a 24 hour period. Then, agent L.C., together with the defendant, “Jeminy” and the three girls, proceeded to a nearby hotel, where Mario was supposedly staying. Upon reaching the hotel, one of the American agents, pretending to be Mario, opened the door, and agent L.C., the defendant and the three girls entered the room. Shortly after, NBI operatives arrived in the room and arrested the defendant and her accomplices. Only one of the three girls, K., turned out to really be a minor. She was 17 years old.",trafficking in persons,1
"On October 1st 2007, victim M.Y. was at her friend’s house in Lapu.Lapu City, when her boyfriend R. and two of his friends (D. and J.) asked her if she wanted to work in Manila. She accepted the job offer and was transported to the capital by D. When they reached peer 3 in Cebu City, she was introduced to the defendant, Rebecca Estrada, who was waiting for them inside a taxi.The victim, M.Y., was asked about her age. She replied that she was a minor and that she was 14 years old. She was told by the defendant to say she was 19 if asked by any customer, she was also instructed to provide sexual services to American and Japanese customers in exchange for tips.The defendant then transported M.Y. to Barangay-Canjulao, where they met with the other two victims, J.C. and M.Z., and they all went together to Mactan International Airport. M.Y.’s mother contacted the police and reported that her daughter had been recruited without her consent. As a result, police officers proceeded to the check-in desk of Philippines Airlines to verify if there was a certain M.Y. booked for Manila, and found out that the victim was effectively flying that same day to the capital.Police officers S.M.L. and E.N. asked the victim’s mother to identify her daughter if she saw her around the airport, and thus the victim was identified, along with 3 other female individuals and one male individual. The police officers waited until the group had passed trough the security control and noticed that the male individual was about to leave, so they escorted him into the police offices to interrogate him.Afterwards, they continued observing the group as they checked in and proceeded to the terminal to pay the terminal fee. At that point, they intercepted the group and conducted the older woman (later identified as the defendant, Rebecca Estrada) to the police office in order to interrogate them about M.Y. and the two other girls. The three minors where also brought into the office where victim M.Y. and her mother met.The police officers found three tickets and boarding passes, one for each one of the victims, and interviewed each of them separately. The investigation on Rebecca Estrada showed that she had no legal documents or permits allowing her to engage in the recruitment of minors, and she was therefore arrested.L.P., an officer of the Department of Social Welfare Development (DSWD), testified that she was informed of a rescue operation at Manila International Airport and she proceeded immediately to Security Office, where she found the three minors, the arrested Rebecca Estrada and the mother of one of the minors. She interviewed the minors, identifying herself as a member of DSWD, and talked in an informal, distended manner with them. One of the main pieces of evidence found by the police during the investigation was the ID card of Rebecca Estrada, which showed the address of a bar. When the defendant was asked about that address, she responded that it was a restaurant. The officers proceeded to confirm it and carried out surveillance of the bar. As a result, the police found a number of young girls who entertained the customers, and law enforcement officers were able to establish that these clients paid the manager in order to have sex with them. The girls sometimes received half of the amount paid by the clients.",trafficking in persons,1

The agents posed as customers interested in paying for the sexual services of two girls. They where received by one of the defendants, L.V. Later on, they met Val Martin (another defendant in this case) and discussed the price of the sexual services provided by the girls who accompanied him. A third defendant (S.V.) led the agents, to a ‘display room’ and pressed a button to alert the girls of the arrival of customers. The two police officers chose two of the girls, took them to a karaoke, invited them to dinner and drinks and tried to extract some information about Gate 3 from them by having a distended conversation.

"In August 2012, agents of the Anti-trafficking Division of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) conducted surveillance operations in several nightclubs and bars in Quezon City. The NBI received information from an international charity regarding alleged crimes of human trafficking of minors taking place at a bar in Quezon City.  Upon this information, the NBI carried out an undercover investigation into the bar. Two undercover agents visited the bar, where they met the defendants, who introduced themselves as the bar managers. One of the defendants, J.A.I., brought the agents upstairs, where they saw several girls dancing nude.

"This case initiated on May 14th, 2012 when A.A., a researcher for TV Channel 5, went to the Women and Children Protection Divison (CIDG) at Quezon City and handed the police a video tape that showed prostitution activities involving minors at Novaliches Park.Upon verifying the veracity of the video recordings, the Philippine Police planned an arrest and rescue operation, to be carried out on the 5th of June 2012. The police worked in two separate teams during this operation: a rescue and an arresting team. Furthermore, the Philippines police used ultra violet dusted money in order to prove the crime. Two police officers pretended to be customers looking to hire girls to provide sexual services from defendant J.Z.R. They chose two girls and went to an apartment hotel (aparthotel), where they handed the arranged amount of dusted money to the defendant. Right after completing the transaction, the police officers identified themselves and arrested the defendant.Later on that same day, the police decoys went back to Navaliches Park and were approached by defendant R.V.M. and X.X.X., who offered to provide girls for sexual services. The police officers agreed on a price with defendant R.V.M., while X.X.X. just stood beside him. The defendants took the police officers to an apartment hotel, where they asked them to choose among six women who were there. The undercover police officers handed the dusted money to R.V.M. and X.X.X., and proceeded to arrest them. The girls were taken in and interviewed by social workers.",trafficking in persons,1
"In June 2007, victims A.A.A. and B.B.B., both minors, were taken to Manila by bus by J.M. and J.E.M. without the permission of the minors’ parents. The victims were told that they were going to fetch a friend in Manila, they believed they would only be staying there for the day, and therefore didn´t ask for their parents´ permission, nor did they take any clothes with them.However, when they arrived to Passay, the girls were taken by the defendant to his private residence. There, they met his wife, L., who told the girls that they would have to pay them back for their bus fare from their hometown to Manila. While the girls stayed in the defendant's house, L. transported A.A.A. and B.B.B. in repeated occasions to different hotels and forced them to engage in sexual intercourse with customers in exchange for money.",trafficking in persons,1
"The evidence compiled during the investigation showed that the two victims, both 15 years old, were recruited by a non-identified person. This person deceived them through promises of employment, and told the victims that they would be transferred to Baguio City, where they would work as waitresses. Instead they were brought to Esteron Beerhouse in Katuday, establishment owned by the defendant in this case, where they were forced to work as prostitutes.In July 2009 one of the victims, A.A.A., was rescued by the National Bureau of Investigation.",trafficking in persons,1

The victim was struggling financially, and had had to quit studying due to her financial issues. She decided to accept the job offer and was assured by M.G. that her duties would only include serving drinks. With the help of M.G., she obtained a visa and fulfilled all of the requirements in order to work in Singapore.She travelled to Singapore and met with the defendant, who took her to the hotel where she lived. She then met another woman, with whom she would share the room. They got dressed and ready to go to work, and the victim was surprised when they were taken to a condominium, where a man was waiting for them. The man undressed her and undressed himself too.

"This case initiated when a human rights organization received information regarding the employment of minors by the Red Octagon KTV Bar. As a result of this information, an employee of the organization carried out surveillance of the bar. The charity worker visited the bar on four occasions, and was offered girls by defendant S.S.G. On a second visit to the bar defendant S.S.G. insisted he rented a VIP room. The charity worker took video footage showing the conversations with the defendant and handed it to the National Bureau of Investigation.Upon this information, on June 2009, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) conducted an entrapment operation in Red Octagon KTV bar. The activities that took place on the night of the entrapment operation were filmed, and the transactions and negotiations between the defendants and customers were recorded. An NBI posed as a customer, and he was told by defendant S.S.G. that girls where available to provide sexual services either in the VIP room or outside, paying the “bar fee”.A raid was conducted that night and defendants S.S.G. and N.L.P. were arrested.",trafficking in persons,1
"On January 11th 2006, Makati Police received a written request from International Justice Mission (IJM) regarding a case of trafficking of minors. Upon this information, the Violence Against Women and Children Division was instructed to conduct a surveillance operation at ‘The Lovely Rose Bar’.A number of police officers acted as decoys and pretended to be customers while they investigated the premises. During this operation, officers observed that minors were working at the bar and were able to confirm the allegations made by the informant. As a consequence, a rescue operation was organised, along with the Philippine National Police, the Department of Labour and the DSWD.The operation took place on January 26th 2006. A number of agents entered the premises pretending to be customers, and ordering drinks. The managers of the bar offered the officers the sexual services of the girls working at the bar, and the officers were offered to choose among the girls. The officers were then invited to bring the girls to a VIP room where they could ‘have more privacy’.The agents proceeded to sound the alarm and the raid operation was conducted. The girls were taken to the NBI office, where they were subjected to medical and dental examinations in order to determine their age.

The defendant promised the victim a better life together, so she agreed to move in with the defendant.The victim and the defendant started travelling around the country, visiting different cities and staying in each city for a few days. Finally, when they were in Daet, the defendant told the victim that they had ran out of money and that she would have to work as a prostitute in order to earn money. When the victim refused, the defendant beat her and threatened to kill her.The victim was pimped by the defendant, who forced her to move from one city to another and constantly threatened to kill her if she reported her situation to the police.

"On the evening of May 12, 2009, S.J.C.L. was visited in her home in Victoria City, Negros Occidental by the accused, Rona Doromal Pingcas. Rona was the victim’s neighbor and offered her a job as a waitress in the videoke bar of her co-accused Riza Doromal Pingcas (her elder sister) at Real, Quezon with a salary of approximately Php 3,500/month. Rona spoke with the victim’s parents and both S.J.C.L. agreed on the terms of employment offered. S.J.C.L. then texted her cousin G.L.R. who was also resident in Victoria City, Negros Occidental and asked her if she wished to join her to work as a waitress in Real, Quezon. Her cousin agreed to do so and on the following day, May 13, 2009, G.L.R. went to S.J.C.L.’s house where S.J.C.L. informed her of Rona’s offer. Both victims then went to Rona’s house where Rona informed them that she would buy their tickets so they could travel to Real the next day. Both victims agreed to this and on May 14, 2009, they boarded a bus and proceeded to the pier of Victoria City. There they met two female companions who would travel with them, they were introduced as C and V.They boarded a ship at the pier and travelled to Manila, arriving there at approximately 9:00pm on May 15, 2009. They were met in Manila by Riza and her husband Erick Rosas Morilla who took them by van to Sitio Kisusuyo, Poblacion Uno, Real, Quezon. Riza explained to them that they would work as waitresses. They travelled there with C and V and two of Rona’s children. Rona remained at the pier in Manila; she did not travel with them. They arrived at approximately 4:00am on the morning of May 16, 2009. The property had three cottages and three separate small rooms.They slept for the whole day and woke at approximately 5:00pm. Riza told them to take a bath and then ordered S.J.C.L., G.L.R., C. and V. to dress up. They were then allowed to eat, afterwards Riza told them to fix their faces by applying make-up and once this was finished they were ordered to sit in the cottages. While seated in the cottages, three or four male customers arrived and Riza ordered them to sit with the male customers and entertain them. S.J.C.L. complained to Riza that she did not like this but Riza ordered her to do so, she complied and the male customer began to touch her breast. S.J.C.L. evaded his touch but he told her he would complain to Riza. He then continued to touch her chest and ordered her to drink beer as he would take her out. She told him that she did not want to go out with him and they remained seated while he continued to touch her breast. She cried because she did not like what was being done to her and they stayed in the cottage for two or three hours. The customer left thereafter and she went to her room and cried herself to sleep. The following day, May 17, 2009, at approximately 6:00pm they were again ordered to dress up and sit inside the cottage. Different male customers arrived and again she sat with a male customer who tried to touch her breast while he was drinking. She evaded his touch and began to cry but he scolded her and informed her that he wanted to take her out with him. When she refused he approached Riza. They spoke to each other and then he returned and told S.J.C.L. that he had already paid Riza. She told him she would not go but Riza then ordered her to do so. The customer brought her to a house in Sitio Kisusuyo where she was ordered to go into a room where a sexual act occurred between her and the customer. He had carnal knowledge of S.J.C.L. and it was her first time to experience carnal knowledge with a man. Afterwards she returned to Riza’s cottage where she went to her room and cried herself to sleep.S.J.C.L. testified that whenever Riza ordered the victims to sit in the cottages and entertain male customers the co-accused, Erick, was always with Riza. They continued to entertain male customers from May 18, 2009 to May 24, 2009 by order of Riza and Erick. Erick told them that if they disobeyed he would bury them alive in the seashore. Erick also forced them to watch a sex video via cellphone.On May 19, 2009, S.J.C.L. contacted her fathered via cellphone and he told her to wait to be rescued. Rona arrived at the videoke bar at approximately 6:00pm on the evening of May 20, 2009. Rona scolded S.J.C.L. and G.L.R. in the presence of Riza and Erick and asked them why they had complained and reported their situation to S.J.C.L.’s father. Rona ordered her to retract her statement and if she didn’t her father might be killed. They were rescued on May 25, 2009. Both victims testified that they could not sleep even after they had been rescued and that their womanhood had been destroyed. G.L.R.’s testimony corroborated S.J.C.L.’s and she too suffered the same harrowing situations with male customers as her cousin.Both victims waived their right to moral damages despite the fact their womanhood had been destroyed however the Court ordered that they receive exemplary damages for the pain and suffering they endured.",trafficking in persons,1
"The victim, who was 14 years old at the time (7 November 2008), was brought by an employee of the accused and the accused's mother to perform domestic work in Manila. Instead of being taken to Manila, the victim was brought to Laoag City from her home in Calbayog City to work in a discotheque owned and managed by the accused. She was employed there for 6 months. The victim had two kinds of jobs: ""table, table"", which involved sitting and drinking with male customers and permitting the customers to touch her; and ""bar fine"", which was having sexual intercourse with customers for a fee. The customers would pay the accused 1,500 pesos; the victim was supposed to receive 800 pesos out of this fee. Sometimes, however, she would not receive her share.The victim left the accused's employ in May 2009. She stayed with friends for several months until, at the encouragement of the ""barangay chairman"", she went to the Department of Social Work and Development (DSWD).

"The Public Prosecutor, who was also a private investigator of International Justice Mission (IJM) was conducting surveillance along A.Santos Street in Paranaque, when he chanced upon the accused Arce, his gay friends and his girls offering “short time”. Sensing that Arce was a pimp, the Prosecutor talked to him and befriended him. The Prosecutor introduced himself as a tour guide for a Japanese Travel Agency and told him that he is expecting Japanese tourists coming to the Philippines to be his guests. On June 20, 2009 the Prosecutor received text message from said accused asking him if he wanted to see his girls to which he agreed. They set a meeting on June 22, 2009 to be held beside Burger Machine at Green Heights Subdivision in Paranaque. With a camera hidden inside his belt bag, the Prosecutor arrived at around 8 pm at the agreed place. Shortly after, 4 to 5 girls came, aged between 16 and 17 years. Arce explained to the girls that the Prosecutor was a tour guide for Japanese Nationals who would be visiting the country and those girls would have sex with these Japanese. The Prosecutor went to the NBI to submit his surveillance report for the conduct of entrapment operation on Arce. At the NBI, the agents viewed his surveillance and read his report. The Prosecutor was assigned as a conduit person for Arce in the entrapment operation to be held on June 30, 2009. They formed a team and each person were given their assigned task as follows: the Prosecutor on board rented a van, together with a driver, proceeded to Mini Stop Paranaque. They picked up Arce and his five girls aged between 16 and 17. Among the five girls victimized by Arce, only two testified. The first one was Jelica (17), who was together with her friend Ela. Jelica first met the accused, known as Tita Kim, through her friend Janer Alinas sometime in March 2009 at Lopec Compound in Paranaque City. Janet told her that Kim was a pimp and after a brief introduction, Kim immediately recruited her, which she accepted.At Mini Stop, both girls met the other girls Maica (16  and also testified), G. (18) and I. J. (19) ( the true names of the minors are withheld). Maica, the second witness testified, was introduced to Kim thru her friend Jeffrey, and on June 29, 2009 she received an offer from Kim through text messages to work as a tour guide for Japanese Nationals. As she needed money, she accepted the offer.According to the accused, each of them would receive P 6,000.00 to be given later, as payments of their services as the accused will receive P10,000.00. Thereafter, a van arrived at Mini Stop. They proceeded to KFC Makati  City. At KFC, the Prosecutor introduced Arce to NBI Agent posed as interpreter. Then, Arce introduced the girls to the interpreter and to the NBI asset who acted as Korean national. After the introduction, the interpreter asked Arce how much is the rate of each girl which he replied P 15,000.00 each in exchange of sexual services. Then, the interpreter handed the money to Arce. While Arce was counting the money the interpreter stood up and showed his badge to Arce and arrested him, while the other NBI agents who were positioned nearby approached them.From the foregoing definitions, the Court heard the testimonies of said witnesses and found no reason to doubt that the accused had hired, and recruited Maica, Jelica, Ela, Girlie and Ilona Jane on June 30, 2009 for prostitution.",trafficking in persons,1
"An entrapment operation was launched following three consecutive nights of surveillance undertaken by police operatives. The surveillance was initiated to verify the veracity of a police informant’s report which claimed that there was trafficking of women for the purpose of sexual exploitation somewhere in Borangay Capital, particularly near Baseline.The team leader of the Regional Anti-Trafficking Task Force ordered the surveillance operation to identify the people involved in these illegal activities on June 15, 16 and 17. Police operatives and a civilian asset undertook the surveillance. They observed that there were two people doing the same pattern of activities. One was a lesbian and the other a male person. They would approach the vehicle and go away and upon their return they would have girls with them and the girls would get into the vehicle and drive away. On June 18 they verbally reported their findings and P.I. V. ordered them to conduct an operation to apprehend the persons involved in the illegal activity. The unit planned the operation to include a police decoy, a policeman who would act as a customer and hand over marked bills to the pimps. When the transaction was made he would signal to his colleagues to arrest the suspects. Five operatives were part of the back-up team and an American national who was also an American police officer went with him. They also contacted the DSWD to assist in the rescue of the girls and for turnover of them.When the briefing concluded they travelled to Juana Osmena, near Baseline Bar and upon arrival noticed their target subjects. On June 18, at 9:00pm a male (Dave, the accused) approached their vehicle and made him an offer. A female (Jackie - co-accused) then arrived and they spoke to each other. The pair left in a taxi and the operatives parked their vehicle and stayed in a bar drinking for two and a half hours. At approximately 12:00am on June 19, Dave alighted from a taxi and moved towards their parked vehicle. They spoke to him and he then went to the taxi and knocked on the window, the girls immediately alighted from the taxi. Dave guided the four girls to the operatives for them to choose from. He offered the price of Php 1,000 for each girl. The operative tried to bargain but he was refused because Dave said the price was low already. He also mentioned that the girls can perform any sexual fantasy they would like them to do. The operative gave them the dusted money in the amount of Php 2,100. Dave received the money and passed it to Jackie. This signified the purchase and so the operative signaled for his back up team to move in and make the arrests. Dave tried to run but was apprehended. The two accused were brought to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination and both tested positive for traces of ultra-violet fluorescent powder on their hands from the money used in the transaction. The DSWD representative took care of the rescued victims after the operation.M.R.T.Y. is 20 years old, single mother, unemployed and a resident of Cebu City. She was pimped by Jackie and Dave when she worked as a semi-prostitute at the age of 19. She uses the term semi-prostitute because she only worked as a prostitute when she did not have enough money to survive. She knew the two accused and identified them in Court. She knew Jackie as the girlfriend of the victim C.M.L.A. and had met them both when they came to the house where she rented a room. C.M.L.A. was the girlfriend of the accused Jackie and lived in the same lodging house as M.R.T.Y. On the night of the entrapment operation Dave and Jackie came to the house and told both M.R.T.Y. and C.M.L.A. that they had customers who needed women. M.R.T.Y. asked Dave how much they would receive for providing sexual services. He told them Php 700. It was agreed that Php 400 would go to the girls and the rest to the pimps. They proceeded towards Mango Avenue in search of two more girls. They found them at 22nd St. and invited them to board the taxi if they needed customers. They then drove to Baseline and Jackie and Dave approached a foreigner and a Filipino who were the customers. The girls watched the transaction and joined Jackie, Dave and the customers when called upon. When the operatives revealed themselves the victims were boarded onto a van with DSWD personnel and taken to the DSWD Center where they were interviewed and where they prepared their sworn affidavits.",trafficking in persons,1

"In 2005, the accused offered M.L., a mother of G.L.Y.C., to provide her daughter with a training in Manila and eventually a work in Japan. M.L. refused due to the young age of her daughter. When G.L.Y.C. had not come home for three days, her mother learned from G.L.Y.C’s friend that she had left with the accused to Manila. M.L. immediately went to seek assistance of ABS-CBN who apprehended the accused and the victims in the bus heading to Manila.Another victim, K.M.N., was Teresita Nakilan’s niece. She testified that Teresita had offered her to go with her to Manila for her to train there for a possible work in Japan. The accused promised her that she would be given allowances, cell phone and jewelleries. By these promises, K.M.N. was encouraged and went with the accused until they were apprehended.Two other victims only supported the testimonies of K.M.N. and G.L.Y.C., stating that the accused invited them to go with her to Manila to train for a possible work in Japan as entertainers.The accused alleged that she did not know that the complainants were minors. She further claimed that all of the girls had given her their consent and she had not forced them to go with her to Manila.",trafficking in persons,1
"On September 29, 2011, M.E., a local TV producer, reported the existence of human trafficking in Tondo, Manila, to PO1 N. This report was confirmed by the producer’s TV crew. They provided evidence of a transaction which had taken place while they conducted surveillance in Moriones, Tondo, Manila on September 26 and 27, 2011. The crew recorded an asset contacting pimps and asking for a minor. The two parties haggled over the price. The pimps later returned with a woman which led the TV producer to determine the presence of prostitution in the area.Following these reports, an entrapment operation was launched by police operatives. Surveillance was conducted in Plaza Morga, Tondo, where the alleged trafficking was taking place. An operative, posing as an asset, conducted a transaction with the people in this area. The asset agreed a monetary transaction with the pimps for the provision of a woman in a hotel room approximately 20 metres from the Plaza. A.A.A. told the court that on her way to purchase coffee in Plaza Moriones, she received a call in the early hours of September 30, 2011 from Reynaldo Santiago, who told her someone was looking for a woman. She overheard Santiago and his companion haggle for PHP500. She was supposed to receive PHP350 while the remaining PHP150 would go to the person facilitating the transaction. A.A.A. made her way to the motel as per the arrangements made by Reynaldo Santiago over the phone.When the asset signalled the arrival of the pimps to the Plaza, two of the accused, R.C.M. and R.L.A., attempted to run but were later apprehended and arrested by PO1 N. The operatives proceeded to the motel room in Moriones where they found Reynaldo Santiago, who had arranged the transaction with the asset, and A.A.A., the woman he provided for the asset. Both parties were taken into custody. A.A.A. later identified Reynaldo Santiago as the man who had arrived at the Motel with the guest. She admitted to not having sexual intercourse with any man right before the arrest. She was also unaware at this time as to why she was arrested or brought to the police station.No case for prostitution was filed against A.A.A. The three accused were brought to the police station and charged with qualified trafficking in persons on September 30, 2011. A.A.A was named as a witness for the prosecution along with the TV producer and two of the police operatives involved in the entrapment operation, namely, PO1 N and PO1 B.",trafficking in persons,1

"An entrapment operation was devised and launched by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in coordination with such other government agencies as the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and with the cooperation of the International Justice Mission (IJM). Of the three accused named in the Information, only two were present on the day of the operation, Reynaldo Marange y Galoy, manager of Hanna Valley Music & KTV Bar, Willy Rosales y Mahusay, assistant manager. The third, Eduardo Valencia y Eulin, the proprietor and supposed ringmaster, remained at large at the time of trial.The entrapment operation was instigated following the IJM’s provision of assistance to two mothers who were wary about the plight of their daughters whom they learned had been illegally recruited and forced to work in a prostitution den known as the Hanna Valley Music & KTV Bar, in Marigondon, Lapu-lapu City. On June 2, 2008 the two mothers, C.A.C. and J.C.P., both residents of Agdao, Davao City flew together to Cebu after C.A.C. learned through the DSWD-Cebu that her daughter, C.G. was in their custody after escaping and running away from Hanna Valley Music & KTV Bar. D.C.P., the daughter of J.C.P. was only 16 years old at that time and still a minor. She was still at Hanna Valley Music & KTV Bar. The bar is a pub doubling as a disco bar with karaoke TV that actually offered girls, including minors, to customers for sex at the price of Php 2,000 by way of a bar fine which customers had to pay to the bar managers before they could take the girls out. Acting on this information, NBI Agent V conducted a surveillance of the illegal activities being undertaken therein. He began his surveillance at approximately 8:00pm on June 2, 2008 and continued it into the early hours of the next morning. He met the accused, Marange, at this time while posing as a prospective client and through this accused he was able to confirm the presence of prostitution in this establishment.On June 3, 2008, NBI Agent V and members of his team of NBI operatives launched an entrapment operation to rescue the victims and apprehend those operating the bar. Part of the money to be used in the operation was marked with invisible ink and dusted with ultraviolet fluorescent powder. NBI Agent V acted as a tourist guide for three supposed Korean clients. He was supposed to transact with the malefactors at Hanna Valley Music & KTV Bar to provide a girl for each of his three Korean clients so that the girls would have sex with them elsewhere once they had paid the bar fine to the establishment. Once the transaction was closed a raid would be announced by the operatives. The entrapment operation was carried out on the afternoon of June 3, 2008. Reynaldo Marange y Galoy, acting as manager, entertained NBI Agent V and the three Koreans who pretended to be looking for potential sex-partners. It was also Marange who voluntarily described to NBI Agent V what kind of sexual acts or services the girls were capable of extending to their customers or clients, mentioning sexual intercourse and masturbation, among others. Marange also demanded then accepted the bar fine from the operatives in the total amount of Php 6,000. Willy Rosales y Mahusay, the co-accused, assisted Marange in the transaction. He ushered the Korean guests into a ‘display room’ where they could choose girls. He gathered about twenty girls and made them stay in the display room so the Koreans could freely choose or pick their would-be sex-partner. It was agreed that the three girls chosen by the Koreans would be taken out for sex elsewhere. One of the girls chosen, B.E.T. was only 17 years old at the time, and thus still a child under the law. Marange then informed the operatives that their chosen girls were ready and provided them with their respective hygiene or health cards proving they were ‘safe’ (free from sexually transmitted diseases). NBI Agent V then sent the pre-arranged signal and his colleagues arrested the two accused. The third accused, Eduardo Valencia y Eulin was not at the bar at this time. The girls were rescued and were immediately brought to the DSWD-Cebu. The entire entrapment operation was captured by a video camera which was strapped to the body of NBI Agent V.D.C.P., one of the victims, testified before the Court and presented her birth certificate to prove that she was a minor (16 at the time of the crime). She is the youngest of six children and only reached first year in high school before dropping out. On May 22, 2008, she was recruited by a homosexual man named Anoy, together with three of her friends, C.G., M., and C. in Agdao, Davao City to work in Hanna Valley Music Bar in Lapu-lapu  City. Anoy told her she would receive a huge salary. When D.C.P. left her home she did not ask for her parents’ permission. She left Davao  City without their knowledge. She and her companions took the bus from Davao City Cagayan de Oro City. From there they took a boat bound for Cebu City. They arrived in Cebu  City on May 24, 2008 and took a taxi from the pier to Hanna Valley Music & KTV Bar. Upon arrival they had dinner, took a bath and then had to immediately report for duty. She and the other girls were put on display wearing skimpy and seductive apparel. She was supposed to go elsewhere to have sex if picked by a male customer. This was what their job was supposed to be. Every time a girl gets picked by a male customer she is supposed to receive Php 500 as her share of the bar fine. A girl can only be taken out of Hanna  Valley once the bar fine has been paid to Marange by the customer. In D.C.P.’s case the bar fine was supposed to be Php 3,000. D.C.P. testified that she never had sex with the customers because she was never chosen by any of the male customers. She observed that it was co-accused Willy who enticed male customers to choose girls for sex. The girls were put on display from 2:00pm and if not picked they could be still on display at midnight. They worked seven days a week only resting late at night. D.C.P. estimated that there were approximately 50 girls actually residing or being harbored within the compound of Hanna Valley Music & KTV Bar, although she estimated that there were over 100 girls working like her therein. The girls residing on the compound paid Php 250/week for their lodgings. Her stint in Hanna  Valley lasted from May 24, 2008 to June 3, 2008. She recalled the raid on June 3, 2008 in her testimony. She came to know about it when Marange told her to hide. She hid at the back of the compound and following a telephone conversation with her boyfriend (who told her that her mother was there to take her home) she went to VINE, an institution which helps human trafficking victims, where she was picked up by DSWD workers and was eventually reunited with her mother on June 4, 2008.B.E.T., another victim testified before the Court and presented her birth certificate as evidence that she was a minor (17 at the time of the crime). She was present on the day of the rescue operation and was taken to the DSWD where she was interviewed with the other girls. She initially lied about her age but later relented and gave her true age. She testified that she began working at Hanna Valley Music & KTV Bar in January or February 2008. She was assigned to a room where she could stay but paid Php 250/week for her lodgings. Her work consisted of going out with a male customer who paid the bar fine to have sex with her in some hotel. The payment would be received by the co-accused, Edwin, Willy or Marange. She had to lie on the data provided for her health card as she was still a minor and would not have received one for this reason and therefore would not have been allowed to work at the bar. She testified that Marange acted as the manager on the day of the raid.",trafficking in persons,1
"The accused promised the two victims employment in Malaysia as domestic helpers for a salary of 12,000 pesos monthly. Victim M.C. left for Malaysia on 7 May 2008; Victim M.B. on 15 May 2008. In both cases, the date of departure was two days following their meeting with the accused.The accused and her co-conspirator had a system organized to facilitate the transfer of people from the Philippines to Malaysia for work despite the lack of appropriate documentation. The victims were told to wear white t-shirts and to attach a piece of yellow paper with the letter ""A"" on it to the backs of their passports. Though they left on different days, the departure process for both victims was the same. They met with the accused and the rest of their group at the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport. At the the airport, the travelers in M.B.'s had to sign an employment contract for two years with a montly salary of 12,000 pesos. M.C.'s contract offered a 9,000 peso montly salary, with 3 months' salary deduction to cover travel expenses. Under the contract they were not allowed to have cellphone or any days off.Once the contracts were signed, the accused contacted her counterpart in Malaysia saying that she will arrange the plane tickets. Each traveller was given a ticket and 600 pesos for the travel tax. The group was then met by Racel Ong, an immigration officer and co-conspirator. Ong facilitated the group's passage through immigration. They arrived in Malaysia without incident.In Malaysia they were identified by their new employer by their white t-shirts and the yellow paper on their passports. Their passports and return tickets were confiscated and they were driven for several hours to the employer's home. There they were interviewed by potential employers and peformed various domestic chores around the house. In conversation with other workers at the house, victim M.B. learned that they were expected to have intercourse with customers in order to repay their debt to the employer and return to the Philippines.Both victims were placed in domestic service where they were mistreated, allowed very little sleep and inadequate food. Upon return to the employer's house they were informed that their next stop was the prostitution den. M.C. and M.B. were able to escape the employer's home and came to the Philippines Embassy. They were given shelter and their statements taken and they were repatriated to the Philippines.",trafficking in persons,1
"Victim was living with her parents in the mountains of Cebu Island when she was recruited by a woman in Cebu City purportedly for work as a domestic servant. However, the victim was brought to the red-light district and was pimped out by this woman and other people, including the two defendants. The victim was used for sex on an unnamed number of occasions. The defendants were her pimps at least 3 times.The police were notified about the trafficking situation in this particular neighborhood by the Department of Social Welfare and Development and the International Justice Mission. These organizations also provided photographs of suspected pimps. The police accordingly set up a sting operation in the early morning of 3 May 2008. Two police officers posed as tour guides looking for prostitutes for their customers. They booked two hotel rooms for this purpose. The officers took a taxi to Robinson's Place where they were approached by the defendants asking if they wanted ""chicks."" The officers and the defendants agreed on three women for P500.00 each.The defendants brought the three women to the taxi and the entire group returned to the hotel. The defendants and the prostitutes waited in one of the hired rooms. One of the officers went to the second hired room to inform his colleagues who were waiting there. He returned to the first room with P1,500.00 in marked bills. The defendants accepted the money, and following a pre-arranged signal, the other police officers entered the room and arrested them. An information was filed against them on 5 May 2008 and the defendants were arraigned on 4 August 2008.The victim testified at trial that she had engaged in sex for money and that she had been pimped by the two defendants. Her account was supported by the police. The defendants were found guilty and sentenced each to 20 years in prison and to pay a fine of not less than P1,000,000, and all the costs.",trafficking in persons,1
"Two victims testified in this proceeding. The first, J.A.P., was 14 years old when she went to work for the defendants. She had thought that she would be working in a “carenderia” but was instead forced to work as a prostitute. She started work on 2 September 2007. Defendant Orcullo was in charge of the prostitution ring and the others worked as pimps. Customers were charged 500 pesos to have intercourse with the prostitutes; 150 pesos went to the pimps and the rest to the prostitutes. However, J.A.P. never received any money. Instead, Orcullo kept her earnings and J.A.P. had to buy food and other necessaries from Orcullo’s shop. If J.A.P. refused to work, she was fined 1,500 pesos per day. J.A.P. was threatened to keep her from running away, even when she was discovered by her mother. J.A.P.’s mother contacted the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).Victim J.C.M. was 13 years old when she went to work for the defendants, also starting on 2 September 2007. Her testimony was the same as J.A.P.’s. The prostitutes were required to work from 8 pm to 5 or 6 am. Customers would take them to lodges or hotels to have sex with them. The prostitutes were never paid, and were guarded to prevent escape.The mothers of J.A.P. and J.C.M. went to the NBI on 9 October 2007. J.C.M. assisted with surveillance that morning, pointing out the wooden house where the prostitutes were kept. Orcullo was actually using two houses: the wooden house and a concrete house next door. The NBI did not investigate further into the two houses before the raid because some public employees were rumoured to be involved in protecting the prostitution ring and the NBI was afraid of leaks.The raid took place on 10 October 2007. The initial target was wooden house, but NBI agents were told by people in the wooden house that Orcullo and the victims were in the concrete house. The NBI were accompanied by officers of the Department of Social Work and Development and a photographer from a local newspaper. The Ministry of Justice was not involved in the raid, but the raid itself and the items seized by the police were documented by an NBI photographer.A criminal information filed on 10 October 2007, the day of the raid. The defendants captured (arraigned?) on 26 October 2007.The defendants who had been named as pimps by the victims had various defenses for their presence in the concrete house. They all claimed not to be involved in prostitution, but were in the house to watch TV; to have a drink of water after transporting building materials; to meet a girlfriend; or simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Orcullo insisted that she was not involved in prostitution. She also asserted that she was not given a search warrant during the raid and that she had no idea why these minors were in her house. The chief investigating officer rebutted Orcullo’s testimony saying that she was given a warrant to sign at the house.All defendants were found guilty on the evidence. Their various alibis were found unpersuasive. Furthermore, no direct evidence of conspiracy was needed but could be inferred from the defendants' behavior and their conduct of the offense, of which the court was satisfied.",trafficking in persons,1
"Roberto Acuin, a.k.a. Wovie, offered BBB (17 years old), CCC (15 years old) and DDD (16 years old) to work as dancers for fiesta in Laguna. He enticed the girls with a promise to pay each of them PHP 9000 a month. The girls accepted his offer. Acuin also offered AAA (28 years old) a job as a cashier for PHP 400 a day. She also accepted his offer. Later that day, Roberto transferred all the girls to a bus. He told them that the bus was going to Laguna, but the bus finally stopped at Bicol instead. He then took them to the Hannah Bee Videoke Club. Just after their arrival in the Club, Acuin introduced Salvacion Alamares to the girls as the owner of the house. Alamares told the girls that they would work with the customers at the bar as Guest Relations Officers (GROs) and explained that it meant dancing provocatively for the customers. Alamares introduced the girls to G.A., who worked as the cashier and was in charge of VIP rooms inside the Club.During the period of their stay at Hannah Bee, both Acuin and Alamares instructed the girls to sit with customers, dance and give customers sexual favors. The girls never received the actual salary promised by Acuin. Further, they were under constant surveillance by Acuin and Alamares.AAA succeeded in escaping from the Club two days after her arrival. When Alamares noticed that she was missing, she uttered threats, telling the complainants that she was capable of killing AAA. Immediately after escaping from the bar, AAA went home and told the parents of other girls about Acuing forcing them to provide sexual services as GROs. The parents of the girls sought assistance of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). NBI organized a raid to rescue the girls. Two investigators went to the bar to act as undercover customers. They agreed to enter the videoke club, engage in the services of the minors, and give the go-ahead signal if they were successful in their pretense to take a minor into a VIP room. After the signal, the whole operation team entered the bar and confirmed the presence of seven minors. Alamares and G.A. were arrested, Acuin managed to escape but got arrested a few days later.",trafficking in persons,1
"On August 14, 2008, PDEA Agents led by IO2 Jigger Montallana conducted buy-bust operation in Quezon City, particularly at Starbucks Café along Tomas Morato in Timog, which led to the arrest of Richard Calayag, who, allegedly was with the accused LZT. During the buy-bust operation, the accused handed the fifty (50) ecstasy pills to Calayag, who in turn gave the same to poseur-buyer IO1 Vivien Molina on consignment basis. The accused, however, was able to elude arrest right after Calayag was collared by them.Considering that the accused was at large, the case was initially archived on December 9, 2009. A warrant of arrest was issued by the Court dated March 16, 2009 and on January 14, 2010, police authorities informed the court that the accused had been arrested and was detained at Camp Karingal, Quezon City. Counsel for the accused requested that a preliminary investigation be conducted considering that the accused was not a subject of a proper inquest. On January 26, 2010, the Court directed the prosecution to conduct a preliminary investigation and submit the results of the same within sixty (60) days from that date without any extension. On March 22, 2010, RTC Branch 103 under Judge Jaime Salazar had decided Crim. Case No. Q-08-153546, acquitting Calayag, who was allegedly the companion of the accused during the buy-bust operation on August 14, 2008. On March 19, 2010, the prosecution moved for an extension of time to submit the reinvestigation resolution. Despite the lapse of time, however, no reinvestigation resolution was submitted by the prosecution.Since a substantial length of time had elapsed, the Court ordered the arraignment of the accused on July 16, 2010. The accused entered a not guilty plea, with the assistance of a Chinese interpreter who translated the information into Fukien, a dialect known to the accused. On July 27, 2010, the accused filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the decision of Branch 103 of this court can be treated as the law of the case in the instant case because these two (2) cases had the same sets of facts, evidence and witnesses. At the August 13, 2010 hearing, the prosecution commented on this motion to dismiss and opposed the same. Also on that date, pre-trial was conducted by the Court and the prosecution together with the accused; the counsel agreed that this Court can take judicial notice of all the proceedings taken in Branch 103 of this Court in the case of Richard Calayag, including all the transcript of stenographic notes taken in that court.On September 6, 2010, the accused motion to dismiss was denied by the Court. However, via Judgment dated October 22, 2010, the Philippine courts acquitted the accused of the charges for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.",drug offences,0

"David Fernando Porte pleaded guilty to charges of using a carriage service to access child pornography material, possessing child abuse material and possessing a prohibited weapon (a canister of “Mace” brand pepper spray). Mr Porte migrated to Australian at the age of six from Chile. He was self-employed between 2001 and 2011 when his industrial hardware business collapsed. This was partly due to a work related injury which contributed to his unemployment until the time of his arrest in 2013. Following his arrest, he had secured employment until the time of his sentencing. Mr Porte had been married for 21 years, however had no children. Mr Porte had a criminal history including an offence of malicious injury in 1986. He developed an interest in teenage girls and was found to have downloaded child exploitation material from the internet. At his trial, he indicated that any material involving younger girls had been downloaded as part of bulk downloads of files, and not specifically sought out. He also denied that he sought sexual gratification from such material. During his trial, evidence was given by his psychiatrist, who diagnosed Mr Porte with depression and a hoarding disorder. He was not diagnosed with a disorder of abnormal sexual interest such as heterosexual paedophilia. Mr Porte’s offending was extensive and had been conducted between 2011 and 2013. He had accessed child exploitation material using peer-to-peer file sharing technology (computer technology allowing the creation of a network with a group of computer uses with the same networking program, directly connecting with each other to access files on each user’s hard drives), and had also used a carriage service to access child exploitation material between 5 March and 12 March 2013. Through these techniques, Mr Porte had accessed and downloaded 34,000 items of child abuse material including videos and images.As part of an Australian Federal Police investigation into online child exploitation material in 2013, Mr Porte’s Internet Protocol address was found to have been used in connection with downloading such material. The Australian Federal Police executed a search warrant at Mr Porte’s premises in March 2013 and seized computer hardware and hard drives. Additionally, they discovered a prohibited weapon being a canister of Mace (Pepper Spray). During the execution of the warrant, Mr Porte was found to be in the process of downloading 916 files which were confirmed to include child exploitation material.",cybercrime,1
"Christopher Harold Schipanski made use of the internet to gain access to online child exploitation material. This included using a carriage service to obtain child exploitation material. This offence occurred over a period of just under three years. An aspect of the offending was the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology (computer technology allowing the creation of a network with a group of computer uses with the same networking program, directly connecting with each other to access files on each user's hard drives). Mr Schipanski had downloaded material en masse without necessarily having viewed all of it. However, he had downloaded a total of 47,224 images and 8,017 video files meaning that regardless of whether he had viewed all of the material, his offending was extensive.Mr Schipanski became known to law enforcement in 2011 due to an investigation by the Northern Territory Police Online Child Exploitation Investigation Unit. The unit identified his Internet Protocol address as being subscribed to a child exploitation material share folder as part of a peer-to-peer program. He was also identified by South Australian Police who connected his Internet Protocol address with a child exploitation material shared folder. In 2013 police executed a search warrant on his address in Broken Hill. Upon their arrival he stated 'I'm going to gaol, aren't I?'. This was due to his knowledge of the severity of the offences he had committed. The police discovered child exploitation material on various USB's, disks and computers. In regard to the downloaded material, law enforcement officers randomly selected a sample of images and videos in order to estimate the amount of child exploitation material he would have downloaded. It was calculated that there was a total of approximately 20,000 images and approximately 2,000 videos containing child exploitation material.Prior to his arrest Mr Schipanski was suffering from depression and anxiety and he had undertaken sessions with a counsellor in relation to these matters. The counsellor confirmed this fact at his trial, and stated he had problems relating to post traumatic stress disorder, generalised anxiety and prolonged grief disorder following the passing of his mother. He also suffered from stress in relation to witnessing the death of his grandmother in a motor vehicle accident when he was four. Adding to his psychiatric problems were a problematic upbringing and fractured personal relationship with his ex-wife and lack of contact with his children.",cybercrime,1
"The defendant, Derek Richard Mara, along with three others, made up the core members of a group that traded child sexual abuse material via Internet newsgroups. These core members were responsible for reviewing and admitting new members to the group. They served as “administrators” of the group, along with two other group members. The group’s other members – that is, those who were not part of the core group and did not serve as administrators – were known in the group “as the ‘trustworthy.’”The members of the group did not know the true identities of other members – only the nicknames provided by the members. To avoid detection by law enforcement authorities, the nicknames of members and location of the newsgroup were frequently changed, and members altered filename extensions of child sexual abuse material to hide the true nature of what was being traded. Members of the newsgroup also used encryption, and encryption keys were regularly changed. The child sexual abuse material was traded in the newsgroup as binary files that could not be accessed without a key.Despite being a member of a group that engaged in serious crime, the defendant was not charged with a crime associated with organized crime, such as participation in an organized criminal group. Instead, the perpetrator was charged, pleaded guilty to, and was sentenced for several offences related to the production/distribution of child pornographic material.The defendant engaged in these crimes for his own sexual gratification and not for financial reasons. Nevertheless, financial contributions were made by some members of the group to other members when requests were made for custom order of child sexual abuse material.The defendant was sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment. A subsequent appeal against on the basis that the sentence was manifestly excessive was unsuccessful.",cybercrime,1

The respondent allegedly presented himself as an award-winning investor and told investors that their money would be invested in global Silicon Valley companies. Invested funds were captured by a company called Onix Capital SA, of which the respondent was the founder and principal shareholder. The funds were subsequently funnelled to other companies also controlled by the respondent. Only a small part of the money was invested, when the rest was used for private purposes of the respondent.In 2016, when the fraud started coming to light, the respondent fled to Malta. However, his exact whereabouts were unknown and Malta declined an extradition request filed by Chilean authorities. The respondent’s assets were frozen by a criminal court in Chile in 2016.The respondent was placed in compulsory liquidation by a Chilean Court in May 2017. The person appointed as the liquidator of the respondent estate, Mr Abate, applied before Australian Courts for the recognition of the Chilean liquidation as “foreign main proceedings” in order to liquidate the respondent’ assets in Australia. As some of the Australian assets were under the Chilean frozen order, a Chilean criminal court lifted the freezing order regarding these assets and issued a letter of request to Australia, citing UNTOC, requesting that the assets be placed at the disposal of the liquidator.",money laundry,0
"Ka Sing Lai was a trusted and integral part of an international Hong Kong-based crime syndicate in which he arranged the laundering of proceeds of  methamphetamine trafficking. Mr Lai had a history of travelling to Australia using different passports and names. On 13 June 2015, he travelled to Australia and established himself in Sydney. Between then and 10 December 2015, he flew to Perth on ten occasions in order to deal with the proceeds of crime for the syndicate. Upon arriving in Perth, Mr Lai would separately collect AUD$500,000 in cash from a number of contacts. In order to launder the money, Mr Lai would hire a car which he would use to drive money runners to as many as ten banks a day in order to deposit the cash. The cash was deposited into the accounts of newly established Australian companies although their directors were Hong Kong nationals located overseas. This procedure occurred on 13 occasions and a total of 163 bank transactions were undertaken with the money later transferred offshore. In doing so Mr Lai had facilitated the laundering of AUD$5.9 million. Mr Lai was arrested in Perth December 2015. He was found by police in his rental car with AUD$230,000 cash, six mobile phones and several debit cards.",money laundry,1
"Bangladesh born Prabal Islam came to Australia in 1997 via New Zealand. After taking the Higher School Certificate in 2004, he undertook studies and was employed as a real estate agent from 2012-2013. He had, however, become addicted to the drug Ice and was in debt to his dealer to the amount of between AUD$6,000 and AUD$7000. Mr Islam already had a criminal history including a number of driving offences, and after failing to cease offending he was sentenced to six months imprisonment in 2009. He had also been convicted of a number of offences prior to 2009, including obtaining money by deception, an indictable offence. After his release from prison in 2009, Mr Islam was under supervision by a parole officer until May 2012. He then became involved with a drug supplier who supplied him with drugs, and who provided him cash to pay for flights during which he was asked to take cash to Bangladesh. There was evidence that the drug supplier had significant financial resources and had established trust in Mr Islam to undertake these tasks.Due to being known to the police, a telephone conversation between Prabal Islam and the drug supplier was intercepted by the police on 30 July 2012. The call involved discussion of booking flights for Mr Islam and others. On 31 July 2012, Mr Islam purchased from Delight Travel Pty Limited several business class tickets and two first class tickets to Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh. Each ticket was for return travel. Mr Islam paid AUD$58,660 in cash for the tickets. On the same day police observed Mr Islam attending an address in Sydney leased by the drug supplier who subsequently left with an open top bag containing a number of packages. That evening he was then observed by police attending the office of a solicitor associated with the drug supplier where he collected a sports bag. It is believed that both these instances involved Mr Islam receiving cash from the drug supplier to be taken out of Australia. These bags were taken to the airport in Sydney on 1 August 2012 where Mr Islam met two co-offenders, along with members of his family for whom the tickets had been purchased. After meeting, members of the group rearranged the contents of their bags in order to hide the cash. The group then proceeded to check in and attempted to pass through customs where they declared they were not taking more than AUD$10,000 out of the country. The group was selected for a 100 percent baggage check and were escorted to the customs examination area. After being selected, Mr Islam made a call to the drug supplier expressing concern. During the examination process, Mr Islam advised the customs officers that he in fact had just over AUD$10,000 with him. In the course of the search, the officers discovered a total of AUD$1,023,900 hidden in the group’s bags. Mr Islam declared that the cash was his and was arrested. After spending eight days in custody, he was released on bail on 8 August 2012, despite having previously flown with his co-offenders, not having payed tax since 2006 and being on a government benefit program, NewStart (that supported individuals looking for work).",money laundry,1

On the 20th January Ms Jiao met a man previously unknown to her at the Casino. Ms Jiao identified herself to him by exchanging a AUD$5 bank note with a known serial number. It was accepted by Ms Jiao that this method of identification was a common practice when cash is passed between criminal and money laundering syndicates. Ms Jiao proceeded to accompany this man to the casino car park where she collected a sports bag, and together they returned to her room.Ms Jiao then went to the Sovereign Room at the Star Casino and deposited the money amounting to AUD$624,340 into her casino account. A senior staff member noticed that the cash was in relatively poor condition and was not consistent with the way a bank would wrap currency. Ms Jiao requested that AUD$200,000 of the funds in her account to be transferred to a Commonwealth Bank of Australia account in Brisbane in the name of a money remitter. The Star Casino procedures, however, prevented this.On the 21 January 2013, Ms Jiao withdrew AUD$300,000 in cash and took it to a Pyrmont Commonwealth Bank branch where she was arrested by Australian Federal Police who had been contacted by Casino staff. Through cooperation with the police it was revealed that the money was to be sent to a customer of her brother’s business in New Zealand, also managed by her son.Ms Jiao was charged with one offence contrary to s.400.9(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth)) of dealing with money, the value of which at the time of dealing was more than AUD$100,000, that it was reasonable to suspect was the proceeds of crime.

Ms Shi became known to the Haymarket Westpac branch, who told them various stories about why she was dropping off the money. In November 2011, the branch manager interrogated Ms Shi due to concern over the significant sums of cash being deposited, however his concern was directed at the dangers of carrying significant amounts of cash in person.By December 2011 the Australian Federal Police had begun to investigate the matter due to the large amount of cash being deposited.

"David Michael Wills worked for Woolworths Limited as a top executive in charge of its Management Services Division. He was well regarded and remunerated for his work for the company. In the mid-1990’s, Mr Wills was looking for a new Point of Sale system for Woolworths supermarkets. A proposal was taken to the Senior Executives and Woolworths Board that the company should develop their own system in conjunction with an Israeli Company named Az-Ben. The Australian representative of the company, through his company Smart Retail Terminals, also provided Woolworths with computer software and hardware services. Due to showing favour to Az-Ben and pushing their product, APOS 2000 and contractual arrangements to Woolworths, Mr Wills received corrupt benefits from the company’s Principal. Mr Wills received over AUD$3 million from the Principal due to the importance of his role in the Az-Ben-Woolworths negotiations which gave them the benefit of the international rights to jointly developed product with only a modest return promised to Woolworths. The rights to market APOS 2000 were sold by Az-Ben to an American company National Cash Registers in 1998. However Mr Wills continued to receive a large amount of money. A significant portion of this went to a British Virgin Islands Company, Cross Border Holdings of which Mr Wills was a beneficial owner.The corrupt benefits Mr Wills received totalled AUD$1,395,950.50. This amount was received between June 1997 and December 1998.

"Keith William Dobie is a Gold Coast man who, in December 2009, became the first person to be convicted for offences relating to trafficking in persons under Division 271 of the Criminal Code (Cth). Mr Dobie, a hairdresser from Broadbeach, Queensland, started a prostitution racket after flooding and fire destroyed his hair salon, KD Concepts, in Currumbin [Flatley C, “Qld: Human Trafficker to Appeal Sentence”, Australian Associated Press (7 January 2009)]. The necessary repairs left Mr Dobie in mounting debt, reportedly owing $1,200 a week to violent loan sharks who had lent him approximately $50,000 [Greg Stolz, ‘Thais prostituted to pay off debt’, Courier Mail (Brisbane), 21 October 2008, 5]. In the six months between December 2005 and May 2006, Mr Dobie sought to bring four different women from Thailand to Australia to work for him as prostitutes. It has been reported that Mr Dobie, assisted by a friend in Thailand, provided false information to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) and the Australian Embassy in Bangkok to organise visas for the women [Australia, Anti–People Trafficking Interdepartmental Committee, Trafficking in Persons: The Australian Government’s Response January 2004–April 2009, Canberra, ACT: Commonwealth of Australia, 2009, 72]. The false information presented to immigration officials included statutory declarations that the women were travelling to Australia to visit close friends who would sponsor them. In two instances there was a ‘skilful fabrication’ about a pending wedding (para. 37). Mr Dobie successfully lured two of the four women, victim H. and victim A., to Australia, promising them ‘easy money and generous working conditions’ (para. 37). The women were both mothers and saw the trip as an opportunity to set up their families financially and escape the sex trade [Greg Stolz, ‘Thais prostituted to pay off debt’, Courier Mail (Brisbane), 21 October 2008, 5]. As sex workers in Thailand, Mr Dobie knew that the women controlled when and how often they worked. Whilst aware she would be working as a sex worker in Australia, the victim H. was told she could work whenever she wanted to, while victim A. was promised two days off each week. The sentencing judge, however, later found that Mr Dobie had no intention of keeping these promises (para. 37). Mr Dobie used his own money to pay for the airfares and visas for the two women. When the women arrived in Australia, Mr Dobie organised the advertising of their services as sole operators in local papers and would drive them to and from clients.  The women were left unaccompanied with the clients and without a mobile phone. He reportedly promised the women they would be earning up to $14,000 over their three-month stay in Australia, but the women never received any significant payment from him. The women were only ever paid $20 a day for food and personal care. The women stayed with Mr Dobie in his apartment but were not locked up; it was later noted, however, that they did not need to be locked up because ‘they were isolated by culture, by language and poverty’ (para. 37). (i) First complainant   In the case of victim H., a Thai national, Mr Dobie organised a visa for a three-month period during which she was expected to work. The victim H.arrived in Australia on December 19, 2005. She was pressured by Mr Dobie to work whenever a client called and saw up to five customers a day. She stayed in Australia for only 36 days, in that time servicing a minimum of 50 customers and working between 10 and 18 days. If she refused to work, Mr Dobie would abuse her verbally, saying that she could not leave and would be arrested or evicted if she did so. On one occasion, victim H. was pressured to work even though it was physically painful to do so. Despite earning up to $1000 a day for Mr Dobie, he sent back just $640 to victim H. family after she urged him to do so. When she indicated she wanted to return to Thailand, Mr Dobie attempted to delay her departure; on one occasion he physically blocked her for 30 minutes when she tried to leave. The victim H. ultimately sought assistance from a third party to leave Australia. In April 2006 Mr Dobie was convicted and fined $750 for provision of prostitution in relation to victim H. (para. 37). Despite this conviction, Mr Dobie continued to pursue his trafficking scheme, and as late as May 15, 2006 he was attempting to arrange the illegal entry into Australia of two more Thai nationals. (ii) Second complainant   Three weeks after victim H. returned to Thailand, Mr Dobie arranged for victim A. to travel to Australia for three months. Victim A. was sent a text message and later an email that stated she would not have to work on Sunday or Monday. Victim A. arrived on February 26, 2006 and started work on her second day in the country. She was forced to work every day of her 33-day stay, except for two days when her period was heaviest.  During her stay she had sex with at least 70 customers. Victim A. serviced, on average, three to four customers per day and sometimes up to five customers a day. The sentencing judge remarked that Mr Dobie’s treatment of Ms Aunthso was “particularly demeaning and callous (para. 37). On one occasion Mr Dobie pressured victim A. to participate in group sex with three other men, but she became so hysterical that the customers could not continue. Mr Dobie forced her to work even when she was menstruating and verbally abused her when she sought a day off or expressed an intention to leave. In these circumstances he would tell her that he had paid for her travel, passport and accommodation and as such she had to work.  He would also ‘remind’ her that, because he was her immigration sponsor, she was unable to leave. During her stay she earned approximately $11,000 for Mr Dobie, and of that only $650 was sent back to family in Thailand. The sentencing judge found that victim A. only continued working in the hope Mr Dobie would return the money she had earned for her children. When it was clear this was not going to happen, she sought the help of a third party in order to leave and ultimately reported the matter to the police.",other crimes,0
"This case involves Mr Zoltan and Ms Melita Kovacs, a married couple who owned a takeaway food store in the small town of Napranum near Weipa in Far North Queensland. Sometime in December 2000, the couple decided to bring a woman from the Philippines to Australia to have her work in their shop and as a domestic helper in their home. [R v Kovacs [2007] QCA 143 [2] (‘Kovacs’)] Subsequently, Mr Kovacs (an Australian citizen of Hungarian background) and his friend Mr Balint Olasz made plans to travel to Manila to find a suitable woman. [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [7]] Mr Olasz later claimed that he travelled to the Philippines in 2001 intending to find a legitimate relationship with a Filipina woman after seeing his friend Mr Kovacs had a successful marriage to the Phillipines-born Melita. Because Mr Olasz was on an invalid pension and had little money, it was agreed that Mr Kovacs would pay for Mr Olasz’s airfares to the Philippines, provided the costs of this were offset by Mr Olasz’s new wife working for them for a short period. [Margo Zlotkowski, ‘Marriage no sham, says man’, The Cairns Post (Cairns), 12 February 2010, 11] The first attempt made by Mr Olasz to marry failed when the woman returned to her boyfriend a few days after the ceremony. [Margo Zlotkowski, ‘Marriage no sham, says man’, The Cairns Post (Cairns), 12 February 2010, 11] Ms Kovacs then sought assistance from a woman she knew in the Philippines to identify a suitable person. [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [7]] The woman in the Philippines suggested her niece, Ms G. At that time, the Court later heard, Ms G. was working with her aunt in a sewing factory and earning a little over $10 a week. She was then 25 years of age and living in Manila with nine other family members in a one room, galvanised iron shack with no electricity, running water or telephone. The complainant was unmarried and had a son who was ill. [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [7]] When Melita and Zoltan Kovacs approached Ms G.’s mother (who was in poor health at that time) with their plan, the mother encouraged Ms G. to go with them so that Ms G. could assist the family by sending remittances from Australia to the Philippines. [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [7]] On 8 January 2001 Ms G. and Mr Olasz married in the Philippines. [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [10]]. According to court proceedings in 2008, Ms G was aware that the marriage was a sham only for the purpose of securing her visa to enter Australia. [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [9]] This appears to conflict with a claim made by Mr Olasz in 2010 that he intended the marriage to be legitimate. Mr Olasz spent six weeks living with Ms G. ‘as husband and wife’ in the Philippines before returning to Australia. [Margo Zlotkowski, ‘Marriage no sham, says man’, The Cairns Post (Cairns), 12 February 2010, 11] Following this, communication to his new wife ceased until September 2001 when he returned to Manila for three months. The purpose of this visit was to assist Ms G in her application for an Australian visa due to complications with an earlier application. [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51[10]; Margo Zlotkowski, ‘Marriage no sham, says man’, The Cairns Post (Cairns), 12 February 2010, 11] Almost a year later, on 28 August 2002, Ms G. arrived in Australia where she was met by Zoltan Kovacs at Cairns airport.  [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [10]] Mr Olasz was away on a sailing trip at that time. [Kay Dibben, ‘Man jailed for rape of sex slave ‘niece’’, The Sunday Mail (Brisbane), 21 August 2005, 22] They initially stayed in a motel in Cairns for several days where Mr Kovacs allegedly raped Ms G. on at least three occasions. [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [10]. The allegations of rape form the basis of additional charges] In early September 2002, Mr Kovacs brought Ms G. to Weipa and she began working in the shop during the day and in the Kovacs’ house at night. [ Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [9]] The working conditions of Ms G. can be described as nothing short of slavery. She had to work seven days a week, up to 17 hours per day, with little or no pay. At trial, the Court heard evidence that on weekdays Ms G. was working from 6am to 6 pm in the shop, followed by between four and five hours of domestic work at the Kovacs’ house where she cared for three small children and did household duties. She also had to work in the shop on Saturdays between 6am and 12pm and performed domestic work the remainder of the weekend. She was not allocated any work free days. [ Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [9 - 10]] When Ms G. was ‘recruited’ in the Philippines, Melita and Zoltan Kovacs said that she would receive $800 for her work in Australia, which Ms G. assumed was a sum to be paid monthly. Ms G. was also told that some payment would be withheld to cover the expenses for her visa and travel to Australia. The total amount of these expenses was never revealed to her and she was not informed that she would have to do any domestic work in addition to working in the shop. Mr Kovacs did tell Ms G. that she would ‘have to work for five years before she could leave Australia.’ [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [8]]  After arriving in Australia, Ms G. never received a regular salary. At some point, she received two payments, one of $400 and one of $60. Ms G. then gave some of that money, $350, to Zoltan Kovacs to give to her family in Manila. The family later received about 7000 pesos, which converted to approximately $180, and the Kovacs paid for some medical expenses for Ms G.’s son in Manila. It is not clear whether or not further payments were made to the family. [ Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [8 - 9]] Mr Kovacs continued raping Ms G. in Weipa.  At trial, the Court heard evidence that: Mr Kovacs had sexual intercourse with the complainant at the shop two to three mornings a week before the arrival at work of another employee, Ms Kris. On some of these occasions he gave her twenty or thirty dollars, which he described as “pocket money”. He also sexually assaulted her in the house when his wife was absent. [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [11]] Ms G. did not initially complain of or report the rape because Zoltan Kovacs threatened that ‘they would all go to gaol’ if she spoke to police. [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [11]] Ms G. also continued to believe that she may be able to help her family abroad and did not want her mother to worry. Eventually Ms G. made an attempt to flee from the Kovacs in October 2002, about two months after arriving in Australia. On that occasion she took a taxi to Ms Kris, a co-worker, who was the only person Ms G. knew apart from the Kovacs. But Zoltan and Melita Kovacs found Ms G. immediately, brought her back to their house and confiscated her passport. [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [11-13]] In December 2002, Ms G. was able to flee from the Kovacs successfully with the help of Mr Kovacs’ estranged daughter, Ms Fabian, who was visiting her family for Christmas while her father was abroad. During that time she drove Ms G. to the shop several times and on one of these trips Ms G. told Ms Fabian that she had been repeatedly raped by her father and asked for her help to escape. Together with Ms Kris, Ms Fabian helped Ms G. buy a ticket to fly from Weipa to Cairns. [Kovacs [2009] 2 Qd R 51 [13]] She left Weipa with only a small handbag and the clothes she was wearing. [Kay Dibben, ‘Man jailed for rape of sex slave ‘niece’’, The Sunday Mail (Brisbane), 21 August 2005, 22] A former fishing buddy of Mr Kovacs, Mr Les Morvai, gave evidence in 2010 that he, too, helped to shelter Ms G. while they were in Cairns and that together they went to the Kovacs to demand the return of her passport but were refused. [‘Alleged slavery victim ‘ordered’ around, family friend says’, The Cairns Post (Cairns), 16 February 2010, 9] Ms G. later contacted the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) to inquire about obtaining a new passport and DIAC then referred the matter to police.",other crimes,1
"The case of Ms K.S.R. involves a trafficking syndicate that allegedly forced Korean women to work in Sydney brothels. On March 6, 2008 the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in cooperation with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) searched a number of premises in Sydney (Operation Ekkala), leading to the discovery of ten victims of trafficking and to the arrest of five persons. [DIAC, 2007–08 Annual Report (2008) 112]  Most of the victims were employed at ‘Cinderella’, a legal brothel at 509 Crown St in Surry Hills, Sydney. [Kara Lawrence, ‘Brothel slave case against K.S.R. collapses’ (3 Dec 2008) The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)] The head of the group arrested was 47 year-old brothel owner Ms K.S.R. It was later revealed that before moving to Australia, Ms K.S.R. had served time in prison in the United States for sex trafficking offences and a false tax return, and then moved to Canada where she operated a massage parlour under a false name. [Kara Lawrence, ‘Brothel slave case against K.S.R. collapses’ (3 Dec 2008) The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)] Newspaper reports allege that the trafficked women under Ms K.S.R.’s control were forced to work up to twenty hours a day in pursuance to an artificially inflated contract debt of approximately AUD 10,000–40,000. All of the victims were South Korean nationals who had entered Australia on legitimate work visas.

[Simon Kirby, ‘Brothel madam lied to sex slaves: court’ (7 Mar 2008) The Sydney Morning Herald (Sydney) <http://news.smh.com.au/national/brothel-madam-lied-to-sex-slaves-court-2008-03-07-1xpe.html>] The women claimed to have been either subject to or have witnessed physical abuse. Some reports stated that Ms K.S.R. also issued the women with a series of fines ‘if they failed to make their clients happy’, and police presented records of telephone conversations in which Ms K.S.R. threatened to ‘get’ her former workers and considered hiring ‘some professional criminals to fix them’. [Kara Lawrence, ‘Brothel slave case against K.S.R. collapses’ (3 Dec 2008) The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)] The ‘Cinderella’ brothel had been raided twice in the two years prior to the arrests being made in the present case and a number of young Korean women had been removed. It was widely reported that the syndicate made between two and three million dollars per year. [DIAC, 2007–08 Annual Report (2008) 112; US Department of State, 2008 Trafficking in Persons Report (2008), 62; Paula Kruger, ‘Groups Urge Action to Stop Sex Trafficking’ (7 Mar 2008) ABC Radio, The World Today, <www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2008/s2183209.htm>; Kara Lawrence, ‘Brothel slave case against K.S.R. collapses’ (3 Dec 2008) The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)] Each accused was responsible for different tasks within the syndicate. Ms K.S.R. was widely recognised as the head of the syndicate and appears to be the only one charged with trafficking in persons. Mr J.W.L., aged 23, was a receptionist at one of the brothels; Ms J.H.D., a 35-year-old Korean woman, allegedly lured the women to Australia; and Ms N.K.K., a 42-year-old mother-of-two, was alleged to have been responsible for moving the syndicate’s money.

"The case of SIEV 358 (or 'Kaniva'), termed 'Operation Calder' by the Australian Federal Police (AFP), involves an Indonesian vessel carrying 212 Afghan and Pakistani migrants from Indonesia to Australia on 21 June 2012. It capsized some 100 nautical miles from Christmas Island. 110 persons, including some of the crew, could be rescued by Australian authorities. Two of the organisers and two of the two surviving crew members were later charged and convicted for their involvement in this migrant smuggling venture. 8 or more individual involved in the organisation of this venture were later also arrested in Pakistan and Malaysia. The coroner of Western Australia later also investigated the deaths of 17 persons who drowned in this incident and released a report in August 2013.The smuggled migrants were gathered in southern Java and ferried on smaller boats to the vessel that would take them to Australia. The vessel referred to as SIEV 358 or 'Kaniva' by Australian authorities was a 22 metre long wooden boat carrying more than 200 smuggled migrants from Indonesia to Australia. On 19 June 2012 at approximately 10pm, the vessel first issued a distress call that was picked up by Indonesian authorities and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Further calls were received the following day at 1:30am. At 3:15pm on 20 June 2012 a surveillance aircraft first spotted the plane. Criticism was later raised that at that no one was sent to the aid of the vessel at that time and that the vessel was earlier told to return to Indonesia. The vessel capsized approximately 120 nautical miles from Christmas Island in Indonesia's search and rescue zone on 21 June 2012 . The vessel was spotted by an Australian Customs surveillance aircraft at 3pm that day. At that time, the vessel was already capsized with approximately 40 people sighted clinging to the hull and others in the water. Several Australian and Indonesian Navy and Customs vessels, as well as several merchant vessels, then came the site to rescue the people. By 7:20pm, two Australian Navy vessels had reached SIEV 358 and started to pull people out of the water and from the capsized vessel.Only 110 people, including some of the Indonesian crew, could be rescued by Australian authorities and a merchant vessel.

"The defendant managed a brothel called Diamonds and another brothel called Darlings, exercising significant control in the business of Diamonds and over the victims.The defendant, Ms Wong, coordinated with agents in Malaysia who made the arrangements for the complainants to go to Australia, and with an education agent who facilitated the appearance of the victims’ enrolment and attendance at educational courses. The victims, four Malaysian women, all came to Australia on student visas, with the condition not to work more than 20 hours per week and not to work before their course had commenced. The defendant knew the conditions of the student visas held by all the complainants and she directed them to work in excess of the 20 hours per week permitted, to not attend the educational courses they were enrolled in, and coached them to lie to Immigration officials about their working hours and study. Moreover, Ms Wong either directly, or using Diamonds employees, manipulated attendance records of the complainants at some educational institutions and sometimes met with staff at colleges.All of the complainants knew they were to work in a brothel and had done so in Malaysia. While the victims were aware of the nature of the work they would be performing in Australia, they did not know, nor did they agree to the conditions they would be subjected to during their performance of such work. After their arrival in Australia, Ms Wong directed the complainants to apartments leased or owned by her business partner, K.L., or members of his family. There, the complainants lived in crowded conditions, sleeping on mattresses on the floor or in double bunks, four bunks to a room, paying rent disproportionate to the accommodation which had no space for clothes or personal belongings.Ms Wong used a debt bondage system to pressurize and coerce the women: after their arrival in Australia, she would tell them that they had incurred in a debt to cover the arrangements made for her to go to Australia, and that they had to repay that debt before they could leave the brothel. Moreover, while the victims’ earnings went towards repayment of their debts, they did not dispose of any money, and thus had to borrow from Ms Wong to buy food and essential items, amounts which were added to their initial debt.Ms Wong decided and controlled the women’s working hours. Furthermore, the complainants were not allowed to leave the brothel during working hours except with her permission and only for short periods of time. The complainants were dressed in transparent clothing and identified by numbered tags, they were required to work 17hour shifts, to work during illness, they could not refuse clients, they were constantly threatened and were forced to engage in sexual acts they did not wish to perform, such as unprotected sex, under threats of deportation.

"Ms. Nantahkhum migrated to Australia in 2004 to work in the sex industry. According to the defendant, she was initially sold, exploited and subjected to very severe conditions, but she managed to leave that situation and travel to Canberra. Ms. Nantahkhum then went on to establish a prostitution business in units in Braddon, a suburb of Canberra.The first victim was searching for work in Thailand as she needed to support her family which was in financial difficulty. A woman in Bangkok said she could arrange for her to travel to Australia to work as a sex worker, but that she would have to incur a debt to do so. The first victim was hesitant at first, but she decided to travel to Australia after speaking on the phone with Ms. Nantahkhum, who assured her that it would not take her long to repay the debt, and told her that she would not need to see many clients a day in order to repay it. Arrangements were made for the first victim to travel to Australia, involving a number of deceptive representations to the Australian authorities made by the victim and those who arranged for her visa and travel. She was issued with a visa which prohibited her from working while in Australia.The victim arrived in Melbourne and was met by a man. She then travelled to Canberra where she was met by Ms Nantahkhum and another man. When they arrived at the units in Braddon where the first victim was to live and from where she was to work, her passport and return ticket were taken from her by Ms Nantahkhum. Moreover, she was not given a key to the unit, and was not allowed to leave the unit except with Ms Nantahkhum or her friend. The victim was not free to leave, for she knew little English, knew no one in Canberra, and did not have her passport or return ticket. The first victim was required to work for six days a week, and could work on the seventh if she wished to do so. She had to pay a proportion of the fee for each sexual service provided to the defendant to cover for rent and other expenses, and the rest went to reduce her debt. The first victim retained no money until the debt was repaid, except that on her “free” day she was allowed to keep that part of the fee which would otherwise reduce her debt, and to send this money to her family. The first victim negotiated her debt from 45,000$ to 43,000$. She estimated that to repay the debt, she had to provide sexual services to some 700 clients. Moreover, and contrary to the information given by Ms Nantahkhum during their telephone conversation, she had to see up to 14 clients a day. The first victim was required to work when menstruating and when she was ill. She was not initially allowed to seek medical attention or take time off. When she did take time off, that was regarded as her “free day”, which meant she had to give all the profits she made on what otherwise would have been her free day to Ms. Nantahkhum. Later, the first victim moved out of the unit with another sex worker to a house elsewhere in Braddon, which was arranged by Ms Nantahkhum. When the debt had been repaid, she was then charged a daily rent of 200$ by Ms Nantahkhum, whether she worked or not. Her visa expired on September 2007, and thus she had no right to work in Australia as an unlawful non-citizen. She continued, however, to work for Ms Nantahkhum until she left in April 2008. She remained in Canberra engaged in sex work until June 2008, when she was taken into migration custody.The second victim was also a Thai national. When she travelled to Australia to work for Ms. Nantahkhum she thought that she was going to perform massages only and was not initially told that she would be engaging in sex work. Travel arrangements were completed for her in a similar way to those made for the first victim. The second victim, however, paid for the airfare herself from money that she borrowed. After her arrival in Canberra, she was accommodated in the same apartment block as the first victim. She agreed to share half of the earnings from her sex work with Ms Nantahkhum. She was aware, as was Ms Nantahkhum, that her visa did not allow her to work while in Australia. Later, when she and the first victim moved out of the apartment block to a house in Braddon, she was also charged 200$ per day for rent and other services such as advertising and reception services. When her visa expired in November 2007, she had a discussion with Ms Nantahkhum, who convinced her to stay. She stayed until April 2008, when she left with the first victim and they established their own sex work business until she, also, was taken into migration custody in June 2008.While they were in migration detention, the first victim spoke to the police about what had happened to her after arriving in Australia. As a consequence, this case was initiated.In June 2008, one of Ms. Nantahkhum associates, under her orders, offered the first victim 500,000 Baht to return to Thailand.",trafficking in persons,1
"On the 6th of October 2011, Divye Kumar Trivedi pleaded guilty to human trafficking under s 271.2(1B) of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The defendant admitted to having organised or facilitated the entry or receipt of a person –D.R.C.– into Australia, and to being reckless as to whether that person would be exploited by himself or another person after that entry or receipt into Australia.D.R.C. worked as a cook in India. After meeting D.R.C. in India through a mutual friend in September 2006, the defendant recruited D.R.C. to work at his Indian restaurant in Australia. The defendant hired migration agents to arrange an appropriate visa for D.R.C. D.R.C. was relatively unsophisticated, knew no-one in Delhi and only had a very basic understanding in spoken English, and a limited understanding of written Hindi and Punjabi. For this reason, the defendant’s family assisted D.R.C. in completing the necessary formalities to obtain the visa, bought his airline ticket and also took him to the airport.The victim arrived in Australia on 3 August 2007. He was met at the airport by Trivedi, who took him to his restaurant and took possession of his passport. D.R.C. commenced work at Trivedi’s restaurant on the following day, and ate most of his meals at the restaurant.Following a complaint, the Fair Work Ombudsman undertook an investigation of D.R.C.’s employment at the restaurant, but did not find any contravention of Commonwealth workplace laws and therefore did not take any further action.D.R.C. was told that he could not leave Australia unless he repaid the defendant 7,000 AUSD to cover the cost of bringing him into Australia. He was not able to pay that sum, and believed that he was unable to leave his place of work until the visa period ended.In January 2011, D.R.C. was granted a witness protection (trafficking) visa granting him and his family permanent residence in Australia. The Crown relied on the allegations made by D.R.C., which are the subject of dispute in this case. D.R.C. claimed –these facts were disputed by the defendant- that he was told that he would be living in the storeroom of the restaurant and could bathe in the sink in the kitchen of the restaurant. That he was instructed to tell people that he lived with the defendant at his residence. Financial records of the company that owned the restaurant indicated that D.R.C. was paid 34,631 AUSD in 2008. However, D.R.C. claimed that he was not provided with any money whilst working at the restaurant, he only received 7,250 AUSD which was sent to his family in India. That although bank accounts were opened in his name with the assistance of the defendant, Trivedi retained the PIN number and systematically withdrew any funds deposited in his account. D.R.C. also stated that he worked twelve hours a day, seven days a week.",trafficking in persons,1
"Australian Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (OMCG) compete with each other which can result in violence. This case developed due to conflict between the Nomad and Fink gangs. Conflict between the gangs took place in New South Wales, Australia. Escalating violence between them had become an emergency for law enforcement due to concern that an innocent member of the public would be injured. This violence was being investigated by a specialist police unit of the New South Wales Police dedicated to combatting OMCG and organised crime. On the 5 April 2018, 31 search warrants were executed on Nomad and Fink properties. Material was located which suggested the possibility of an increased danger to the public in relation to particular explosives. Other located material included illegal firearms and drugs. Nine Finks members and four Nomads members were charged with offences and subsequently released on bail. Because of the risk of harm to the community police sought to impose serious crime prevention orders on a number of senior Nomad members in order to prevent escalating violence between the gangs. The NSW police arrested a number of men including the accused Bradley Bowtell, the President of the Newcastle City Chapter and four other senior members of the Nomad OMCG. Each man was arrested for various offences and released on bail. Consequently the police deemed it appropriate to instigate preventative order proceedings on the men to prevent further criminal activity.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"Bangladesh born Prabal Islam came to Australia in 1997 via New Zealand. After taking the Higher School Certificate in 2004, he undertook studies and was employed as a real estate agent from 2012-2013. He had, however, become addicted to the drug Ice and was in debt to his dealer to the amount of between AUD$6,000 and AUD$7000. Mr Islam already had a criminal history including a number of driving offences, and after failing to cease offending he was sentenced to six months imprisonment in 2009. He had also been convicted of a number of offences prior to 2009, including obtaining money by deception, an indictable offence. After his release from prison in 2009, Mr Islam was under supervision by a parole officer until May 2012. He then became involved with a drug supplier who supplied him with drugs, and who provided him cash to pay for flights during which he was asked to take cash to Bangladesh. There was evidence that the drug supplier had significant financial resources and had established trust in Mr Islam to undertake these tasks.Due to being known to the police, a telephone conversation between Prabal Islam and the drug supplier was intercepted by the police on 30 July 2012. The call involved discussion of booking flights for Mr Islam and others. On 31 July 2012, Mr Islam purchased from Delight Travel Pty Limited several business class tickets and two first class tickets to Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh. Each ticket was for return travel. Mr Islam paid AUD$58,660 in cash for the tickets. On the same day police observed Mr Islam attending an address in Sydney leased by the drug supplier who subsequently left with an open top bag containing a number of packages. That evening he was then observed by police attending the office of a solicitor associated with the drug supplier where he collected a sports bag. It is believed that both these instances involved Mr Islam receiving cash from the drug supplier to be taken out of Australia. These bags were taken to the airport in Sydney on 1 August 2012 where Mr Islam met two co-offenders, along with members of his family for whom the tickets had been purchased. After meeting, members of the group rearranged the contents of their bags in order to hide the cash. The group then proceeded to check in and attempted to pass through customs where they declared they were not taking more than AUD$10,000 out of the country. The group was selected for a 100 percent baggage check and were escorted to the customs examination area. After being selected, Mr Islam made a call to the drug supplier expressing concern. During the examination process, Mr Islam advised the customs officers that he in fact had just over AUD$10,000 with him. In the course of the search, the officers discovered a total of AUD$1,023,900 hidden in the group’s bags. Mr Islam declared that the cash was his and was arrested. After spending eight days in custody, he was released on bail on 8 August 2012, despite having previously flown with his co-offenders, not having payed tax since 2006 and being on a government benefit program, NewStart (that supported individuals looking for work).",participation in organized criminal group,1
"Mark William Standen was a New South Wales Crime Commission Assistant Director at the time of his arrest by the Australian Federal Police on the 2nd June 2008. Mr Standen had a long history of working for law enforcement and investigative bodies including the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission which he joined in 1996. The NSW Crime Commission’s objectives included activities such as reducing illegal drug trafficking and organised crime. Mr Standen headed an investigation team focussing on drug  trafficking and money laundering. Through his position, Standen acquired an understanding of structures and methods of operation of criminal organisations, with much of this knowledge gained through interaction with informers.Mr Standen was alleged to have conspired with two individuals to important substances for the use in the manufacture of controlled drugs. The main substance that was to be imported was pseudoephedrine which was imported in a commercial quantity. Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic drug and is a common ingredient in methamphetamine, although it can be found in prescription nasal decongestants. The amount to be imported was 300 Kilograms. Mr Standen knew one of the individuals through his wife who had previously been a colleague. The other individual was known to Mr Standen having previously been an informant. Both co-conspirators had a criminal past aiding in their development of the conspiracy. The conspiracy itself involved a wider network including a Dutch criminal syndicate. While taking part in the conspiracy to import and the supply of drugs, Mr Standen also conspired with his co-conspirators to pervert the course of justice in relation to the judicial power of the Commonwealth. Mr Standen agreed to use his position to obtain knowledge and information to prevent court proceedings being undertaken against himself and his co-conspirators.A major element in the criminal activity was a loan of one million dollars from one of the co-offenders to the other in cash. This loan was known to Mr Standen. The first co-offender disguised the money through investments and using his legitimate business. Together the group conspired to import the pseudoephedrine from Pakistan. While Mr Standen was arrested in 2008, a criminal investigation involving Mr Standen had begun in July 2007 by the Australian Federal Police. The investigation had involved surveillance of Standen and his co-conspirators which led to his arrest. Importantly the arrest occurred before the drugs had been imported.",drug offences,1
"The defendant managed a brothel called Diamonds and another brothel called Darlings, exercising significant control in the business of Diamonds and over the victims.The defendant, Ms Wong, coordinated with agents in Malaysia who made the arrangements for the complainants to go to Australia, and with an education agent who facilitated the appearance of the victims’ enrolment and attendance at educational courses. The victims, four Malaysian women, all came to Australia on student visas, with the condition not to work more than 20 hours per week and not to work before their course had commenced. The defendant knew the conditions of the student visas held by all the complainants and she directed them to work in excess of the 20 hours per week permitted, to not attend the educational courses they were enrolled in, and coached them to lie to Immigration officials about their working hours and study. Moreover, Ms Wong either directly, or using Diamonds employees, manipulated attendance records of the complainants at some educational institutions and sometimes met with staff at colleges.All of the complainants knew they were to work in a brothel and had done so in Malaysia. While the victims were aware of the nature of the work they would be performing in Australia, they did not know, nor did they agree to the conditions they would be subjected to during their performance of such work. After their arrival in Australia, Ms Wong directed the complainants to apartments leased or owned by her business partner, K.L., or members of his family. There, the complainants lived in crowded conditions, sleeping on mattresses on the floor or in double bunks, four bunks to a room, paying rent disproportionate to the accommodation which had no space for clothes or personal belongings.Ms Wong used a debt bondage system to pressurize and coerce the women: after their arrival in Australia, she would tell them that they had incurred in a debt to cover the arrangements made for her to go to Australia, and that they had to repay that debt before they could leave the brothel. Moreover, while the victims’ earnings went towards repayment of their debts, they did not dispose of any money, and thus had to borrow from Ms Wong to buy food and essential items, amounts which were added to their initial debt.Ms Wong decided and controlled the women’s working hours. Furthermore, the complainants were not allowed to leave the brothel during working hours except with her permission and only for short periods of time. The complainants were dressed in transparent clothing and identified by numbered tags, they were required to work 17hour shifts, to work during illness, they could not refuse clients, they were constantly threatened and were forced to engage in sexual acts they did not wish to perform, such as unprotected sex, under threats of deportation. Moreover, the victims were threatened with harm to themselves and their families if they left Diamonds before their debts were repaid.",drug offences,1
"On 13 October 1998, the Uniana, a small cargo boat, launched a speed-boat with a three-man crew just off the coast of northern New South Wales near Port Macquarie.The boat reached shore. The occupants were arrested and the shore-based support group was pursued and its members taken into custody at Nabiac. Thirty-one duffel bags containing many kilos of heroin powder were stowed in the speed-boat. In the early hours of 14 October the Uniana was pursued by two Customs boats and the HMAS BENDIGO. It was arrested, boarded and searched and the remaining crew were taken into custody.The amount of heroin powder when analysed was found to weigh 389 kilos and contained 252 kilos of pure heroin with an estimated street value of $620,000,000.It was the conclusion of a long and doubtless expensive investigation which ranged from Hong Kong to Australia and New Zealand.The Uniana was in fact a fishing trawler which has been specially converted for the heroin trade. Although its gunwales had been raised, the cargo hold so enlarged contained only the speed-boat. The ship's only functional derrick was installed solely for the purpose of lifting the speed-boat and launching it. The remainder of the space was used to accommodate long range tanks to obviate the need for frequent re-fuelling.One of those intimately concerned in the importation of the heroin, a prisoner called Chan, gave evidence of the ship's voyage from Hong Kong to the Andaman Sea where the heroin was, after a ten day wait, loaded at night many miles from the coast. Also brought on board was a Chinese national. The voyage then continued down the Kra Isthmus through the Straits of Malacca to Singapore where, by pre-arrangement, a bunkering lighter came out to meet it and the Uniana was re-fuelled.It then proceeded without again stopping, except to lower the speed-boat in order to test its engine, towards Australia, sailing south in the Java Sea, north through the Makassar Straits and then south-east along the northern coast of New Guinea until it reached Atoa where it turned south, sailing through the Coral Sea to Australia and its final destination at Port Macquarie.The heroin had been stowed in a secret compartment beneath the hold which housed the speed-boat. This compartment contained a specially constructed valve which could be used to flood it in case of sudden search and so deceive any Customs officers.The crew, largely Indonesian, had been recruited over a period for another small vessel, the On Shun, and on the day before they left Hong Kong the crew was transferred to the Uniana which had, a little time before, been renovated and registered in Belize.Much, if not all, of the foregoing was not in dispute. The issue central to the case was that of knowledge. The prisoners had, it was conceded, been involved or concerned in the importation of heroin. None however conceded that this concern was knowing concern.The case against each was, as a result, circumstantial, hinging on evidence acquire through the boarding of the Uniana. The Uniana was ordered to stop and prepare for boarding upon its entry into the Australian territorial sea. At this point the Uniana changed direction and left the territorial sea but the pursuit drove it back from the high seas into the territorial sea at which point it was boarded and searched.",drug offences,0

"In March 1973 the vessel Mariana made a voyage from Darwin in return voyage towards Australia, the vessel was under the observation of Australian authorities concerned with the administration of the Australian customs. As the vessel neared the port of Darwin, an Australian Army helicopter co-operating with those authorities began to descend over the vessel in a fashion and to a degree well calculated to alert those on the vessel to the fact that the vessel was under close surveillance. A launch carrying customs officers was at the same time on its way from Darwin towards the vessel. The action of the helicopter indicated to them the imminence of a boarding operation by the customs.Joseph Corns was the master of the vessel: Barry Richard Bull, John Plithakis and Gregory James Conn were either crew members or passengers upon it. The vessel was carrying cannabis, procured in Bali and packed in suitcases. On the near approach of the helicopter these suitcases were jettisoned by those on board the vessel and its decks washed down so that upon the subsequent inspection of the vessel when boarded by the customs officers no cannabis was found on board. Later, in the port of Darwin, no cannabis was found upon any of the persons who had been on the vessel other than 14.8 grams of cannabis resin which was found on Gregory James Conn. However, as the vessel after being boraded was brought into port under escort, the possession within the limits of the port of this quantity of cannabis resin was not relied upon by the Crown in connexion with any of the charges subsequently laid. Some of the contents of the jettisoned suitcases, amounting to 31,000 grams of cannabis, was recovered from the sea by officers of customs.Joseph Corns, Barry Richard Bull, John Plithakis and Gregory James Conn (the accused) were thereafter indicted before the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory with having committed offences against the Customs Act 1901-1971 (Cth) (the Act). In the trial on this indictment, some of the charges were withdrawn, and upon others there was either a verdict of acquittal or no verdict at all. All four accused, however, were found guilty by the jury: 1. of importing into Australia a prohibited import, namely, cannabis, contrary to s. 233B (1)(b) of the Act; 2. of having in possession on board a ship a prohibited import, namely, cannabis, contrary to s. 233B (1)(a) of the Act; and 3. of assembling for the purpose of preventing the seizure of a prohibited import, namely, cannabis, contrary to s. 231 (1) (c) of the Act. The assembling contrary to the Act was said to have taken place on the vessel. Joseph Corns was also found guilty of knowingly allowing the vessel to be used in the importation of goods contrary to s. 233A of the Act.",drug offences,0
"On 14th February 2013, the NGO ""Telefono Arcobaleno"", which operates in the field of the protection of children's rights, denounced to the Public Prosecutor Office of Siracusa the existence of a website in which participants shared child pornography material. Investigations led to the identification of a virtual community, called ""Foto di Preteen"", and its subscribers. The Nucleo Investigativo Telematico (special department of the Public Prosecutor office which conducts investigations requiring digital expertise) acquired the IP codes of every user who accessed the website and through these it was possible to identify the participants of the online community. The Public Prosecutor also ordered house searches and the seizure of hardware and software contents alleged to be child abuse photos.Defendants C. M., D. M., M. S. and S. G. were all suspected, together with other users not yet entirely identified, of being part of an organized criminal group aimed at sharing, distributing and obtaining child pornography contents online. Moreover, investigations highlighted the structure and the modus operandi of the online community. The creator and the promoter of the website was C. M., who called himself ""the master"" (""il padrone""). Through a message that precedes the access to the website's homepage, he warned the new users about the contents of the online community and listed the rules for being a permanent member of it. In order to view, download and upload the website's contents, they had to make a subscription, fill in a form and create a nickname. The webmaster approved new subscriptions but could also remove subscribers who did not comply with the website's rules. In fact, subscribers had to upload new contents regularly or they would have been banned from the online community. Shortly after the arrest, C. M. confessed to his crimes and the illegal network was dismantled.The Court concluded for the existence of an organized criminal group (associazione per delinquere, art. 416 of the Italian criminal code) operating online and aiming at the commission of online child abuse crimes' related.The Court convicted C.M. for participating to the organized criminal group as the promoter and creator (art. 416) and for distributing child pornography material online (art. 600 ter comma III of the Italian criminal code).The Court convicted D. M. and M. S. for obtaining child pornography material online (art. 600 quater of the Italian criminal code). The Court considered proved their participation in the criminal group, but they could not be convicted because of the Statute of limitation.The Court absolved S. G. of all charges (articles 416 and 600 quarter of the Italian criminal code) because is conduct of accessing for a very short period of time the website without downloading or uploading is not sufficient to prove his guilty.",cybercrime,1
The case involves the sending of fake email messages to employees of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other civil servants in order to steal their credentials and access restricted information. The emails were structured in such a way to appear to come from a legitimate sender. The messages contained a hidden trojan horse (malware) able to keep a log of every keystroke typed on the victims' keyboards. Such malware allowed the suspects to obtain usernames and passwords of the victims. The information stolen was then transferred to servers located in Malaysia and then sold.,cybercrime,0
"The defendants were deemed to be members of an organised criminal group dedicated to systematically smuggling migrants from Tunisia to Italy (via Sicily) and, eventually, to other locations in Europe. The organised criminal group facilitated the illegal entry, transit and stay of irregular migrants in Italy (and other European countries, especially France and Belgium) with the purpose of obtaining profit (average of 2000 Euro per person). The smuggling venture was carried out via speed-vessels* and it targeted relatively well-off North African nationals. In addition, the organised criminal group was also involved in tobacco contraband and money laundering.The organised criminal group was well structured, whereby each member had determined tasks assigned. Specifically:-       Defendant 1 was the leader of the organised criminal group, managing and directing it in Tunisia. This entailed (i) collecting and receiving payments, (ii) interacting with interested clients (i.e. migrants to be smuggled), (iii) providing for the necessary means of transport to carry out the planned smuggling ventures from Tunisia to the coast of Italy, (iv) recruiting individuals to master the vessels, (v) reception of, and ‘care’ for the migrants in Italy, (vi) arranging for the eventual continuation of the smuggling venture to other European countries, (vii) managing the proceeds of smuggling activities, including by acquiring new means of transportation (vessels).-       Around 6 September 2016, Defendant 2 provided her husband (i.e. Defendant 1) the funds necessary to acquire vessels to engage in the smuggling ventures.-       Defendants 2, 3 and 4 assisted Defendant 1 in the organisation and promotion of the organised criminal group, especially following the detention of Defendant 1 on 20 October 2016. They were ‘right arms’ of Defendant 1.-       Defendants 5 and 16 were charged in particular with the specifics of acquiring new sea-craft and liaising with in-land associates so as to ensure the reception and ‘care’ of migrants once in Sicily.-       The remaining defendants – all operating in Sicily, in particular in the provinces of Trapani, Agrigento and Palermo – acted under the direct instructions of the ‘organisers’ by receiving/collecting/orienting the smuggled migrants upon their arrival in Italy. They further managed and or directly received payments as well as served as intermediaries between irregular migrants and smugglers operating in other areas that could assist in facilitating the transit to the desired areas/countries of destination. These defendants also provided, if needed, logistical support, e.g. accommodation, transportation in view of future movements.-       Defendants 7 and 14 directly helmed vessels transporting an undetermined number of migrants to Italy.-       Defendant 11 transferred into Italy the proceeds of smuggling of migrants that were still being held abroad. He did so under a modus operandi aimed at, and with the purpose of, concealing the origin of the profits. Importantly, the organised criminal group further used its resources to engage in the contraband of cigarettes and tobacco. The tobacco was received/collected in Tunisia with the purpose of being smuggled into Italy, taking advantage of the criminal enterprise set in motion in order to further smuggling of migrants activities. In this regard, the defendants kept tasks and roles aligned with the description provided above.Through investigations it became clear that this line of ‘business’ was appealing to criminals wanted by Tunisian authorities who saw in it the best option to escaping the reach of justice. The evidence gathered made it very realistic that individuals linked to the Islamic jihad could also resort to the services provided by this organised criminal group. Authorities were able to confirm at least five migrant smuggling episodes, with the following dates of arrival in Italy: (i) 10 October 2016, (ii) 20 October 2016, (iii) 3 December 2016, (iv) 18 February 2017, (v) 17 March 2017.By the same token, authorities were able to document at least two instances of tobacco contraband, which culminated in over 103 kilograms illegally introduced in Italy: (i) 1 September 2016, (ii) 17 March 2017. In establishing the fact, authorities relied muchon testimonial evidence (notably declarations of smuggled migrants and defendants) and surveillance techniques (including interception of communications and personal monitoring), and radiolocation techniques. Legal Findings:Against this background, the Public Prosecutor argued for the existence of strong indicia on the suspects’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants (associazione a delinquere). The defendants were thus indicted for migrant smuggling (for facilitation of illegal entry and or facilitation of illegal stay) and membership in an organised criminal group.The Prosecution noted the existence of a number of aggravating circumstances. Notably:-       Re membership in an organised criminal group: (i) having carried out the criminal conduct through an organised criminal group operating in more than one State, (ii) more than ten individuals having been involved in the perpetration of the crime;-       Re migrant smuggling: (i) having participated in the smuggling of five or more persons, (ii) having committed the crime in three or more individuals, (iii) purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit with the proscribed conduct. For details on the legal reasoning applied, see infra under “Commentary”. ----* Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)). Accordingly, it comprises unseaworthy ships and boats in precarious conditions.",money laundry,0
"The operation originates from the investigations made by the Anti-Mafia Investigation Department of Reggio Calabria, ended in May 2013 with the execution of an order for precautionary custody - issued by the Court Judge- against 22 subjects deemed to belong to Gallicianò 'ndrangheta operates in the municipality of Condofuri and neighboring territories, as well as in the province of Viterbo.The investigative activity, started on September 2009, was divided into two phases. In the first step, the investigations have focused on Nucera family, head of Gallicianò area, and allowed the identification of a well-established money laundering system that starting from Calabria, passed through companies located in Viterbo, and then return in Reggio Calabria area in monthly tranches of 7500 euro and one-off of 50.000 euros, for a total of 600.000 euros. The operation takes its name from this ""recycling"" activity, which has allowed the construction of an entire empire and economic heaven in the province of Viterbo.

"The present case originates from the preliminary investigation delegated to the Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza) of Castelnuovo, in the proceeding n. 3159/10, relating to evidence of crime against 2 suspects.Mobile telephone interceptions and close monitoring operations revealed their involvement in a stable organization for the retrieval and marketing of griffed counterfeit products (such as Moncler, Burberry, Nike, Louis Vuitton etc.) centered in Naples, but with various relationships with China and Bangladesh, where the goods were produced using high manufacturing standards.In particular, the investigation made possible to detect the existence of 4 organized criminal groups, perfectly organized with distinction of hierarchies and roles and operating under the direction of a Mafia (""Camorra"") organization operating mainly in Naples, aimed at committing typical mafia crimes (extortion, illecit control over economic activities, counterfeiting, usury, laundering etc.) with use of intimidating powers and use of financial resources of criminal origin.The complex structure of this organization was described as ""criminal holding"".Article 2 (a) of CTOC well defines ""Organized criminal group"" as ""a structured group of three or more persons, existing for a period of time and acting in concert with the aim of committing one or more serious crimes or offences established in accordance with this Convention, in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit"".Through the interception it was possible to trace the identity of the leaders of the organization, who dealt with the importation of counterfeit products mainly from China, through the intermediary of Mr. XX, Chinese, who carried out orders for hundreds of thousands euro to Chinese businesses devoted to counterfeiting.The sorting of products and the subsequent sale in Italian territory was overseen by the brothers YY.The huge profits were then reinvested in the same illegal activity, allowing the growth of the economic power of the organization.The conversations and telephone communications of the suspects allowed, time after time, to locate other associations dedicated to import, production and sale of counterfeit goodsAt the end of the first phase of investigations, the criminal report was drafted and, subsequently, the anti-Mafia District Directorate of Naples requested to the Investigating Magistrate the application of the precautionary measures of seizure of goods and pre-trial detention against 67 suspects.",money laundry,0
"The case concerns several facts of fencing committed between 2007 and 2008, relating to about 12,000 kg of copper and yard tools stolen all around Sicily.The ""band of copper"" had a pyramidal structure in which each member had a specific function, but it was more properly a family-run business: The chief was in charge of the sale of copper, while the grandchildren were responsible for the recovery of stolen copper and other members cleaned up the copper wires from the plugs.They then deposited the material in a warehouse before selling and delivering it to companies that deal with the recovery of ferrous materials, earning from the sale various hundreds of thousands Euros.After several complints of theft, the investigation began with a local search performed on 3.07.07 in a storage site for copper and other materials in Palermo, owned by one of the defendants. In the site approximately 1,200 kg of copper were found.Subsequently, the Financial Police started an activity of interception of communications (telephone tappings) and surveillance, even using a GPS monitoring system on some of the vehicles owned by the defendants.All of the 16 defendants were accused of the crime of association in an organized criminal group aimed at the commission of crimes against property, in particular fencing and laundering the aforesaid goods.Article 2 (a) of CTOC says that ""Organized criminal group shall mean a structured group of three or more persons, existing for a period of time and acting in concert with the aim of committing one or more serious crimes or offences established in accordance with this Convention, in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit""; in this case the existence of a structured criminal group was clearly demonstrated by the evidence of close links between the accused (most of the members were infact close relatives).",money laundry,0
"Italian authorities’ investigations found out a structured organisation composed by four different criminal groups involved in several crimes related to the realization and the importation in Italy of counterfeited products, especially clothing.The four groups were basically independent one from the others in both the production and the distribution of counterfeited products, however they could be considered as a big organisation due to the mutual cooperation in order to find raw materials or participate to other organisations’ illicit operations.The four groups were very active in the importation in both the national and the communitarian territory of a large amount of counterfeited products made in China, using clandestine factories without any sort of authorization from the owners of the brands counterfeited, such us Dolce e Gabbana, Moncler, Burberry, Hogan, Blauer, Nike, etc.In this way, according to the several wiretappings and the numerous seizures, the accused managed to realize a huge fake market, able to seriously compromise the analogous licit one. Furthermore, the groups operated in total disrespect of industrial property laws, damaging the manufacturers, the licit distributors and those who operates in the commercial circuit, but also the final consumers who, buying those products in complaisant shops, bought poor quality products, often dangerous to health.",money laundry,0
"The case concerns a important criminal organization active in Lombardy, and especially in hinterland southwest of Milan. This organization is a type of organized crime syndicate that primarily practiced protection racketeering, the use of violent intimidation to manipulate local economic activity, especially illicit trade, being bonded by a code of honour, in particular the code of silence that safeguarded the organization from outside intrusion and law enforcement action. The organization was responsible for delivering usurious cash loans, to agree on interest rates, the collecting interest usurious activity through intimidation, blackmail and violence; to make investments in real estate activities, bars, restaurants and assign to figureheads local businesses and corporate shares. The family is linked to ""Valle-De Stefano"" clan, which is a criminal group that has made the history of the 'Ndrangheta in Calabria, active in Milan since the seventies. The clan ""Valle"", native of Calabria, moved to Lombardy in the seventies, because of a bloody war fought in those years by criminal organizations in Calabria.Until the nineties, the Valle family had rooted in Pavese, and then expand their territory until hinterland south-west of Milan. In the grip of the Calabrian family, have fallen, according to the evidences,several of entrepreneurs and craftsmen.

"The defendants were deemed to be members of an organised criminal group dedicated to systematically smuggling migrants from Tunisia to Italy (via Sicily) and, eventually, to other locations in Europe. The organised criminal group facilitated the illegal entry, transit and stay of irregular migrants in Italy (and other European countries, especially France and Belgium) with the purpose of obtaining profit (average of 2000 Euro per person). The smuggling venture was carried out via speed-vessels* and it targeted relatively well-off North African nationals. In addition, the organised criminal group was also involved in tobacco contraband and money laundering.The organised criminal group was well structured, whereby each member had determined tasks assigned. Specifically:-       Defendant 1 was the leader of the organised criminal group, managing and directing it in Tunisia. This entailed (i) collecting and receiving payments, (ii) interacting with interested clients (i.e. migrants to be smuggled), (iii) providing for the necessary means of transport to carry out the planned smuggling ventures from Tunisia to the coast of Italy, (iv) recruiting individuals to master the vessels, (v) reception of, and ‘care’ for the migrants in Italy, (vi) arranging for the eventual continuation of the smuggling venture to other European countries, (vii) managing the proceeds of smuggling activities, including by acquiring new means of transportation (vessels).-       Around 6 September 2016, Defendant 2 provided her husband (i.e. Defendant 1) the funds necessary to acquire vessels to engage in the smuggling ventures.-       Defendants 2, 3 and 4 assisted Defendant 1 in the organisation and promotion of the organised criminal group, especially following the detention of Defendant 1 on 20 October 2016. They were ‘right arms’ of Defendant 1.-       Defendants 5 and 16 were charged in particular with the specifics of acquiring new sea-craft and liaising with in-land associates so as to ensure the reception and ‘care’ of migrants once in Sicily.-       The remaining defendants – all operating in Sicily, in particular in the provinces of Trapani, Agrigento and Palermo – acted under the direct instructions of the ‘organisers’ by receiving/collecting/orienting the smuggled migrants upon their arrival in Italy. They further managed and or directly received payments as well as served as intermediaries between irregular migrants and smugglers operating in other areas that could assist in facilitating the transit to the desired areas/countries of destination. These defendants also provided, if needed, logistical support, e.g. accommodation, transportation in view of future movements.-       Defendants 7 and 14 directly helmed vessels transporting an undetermined number of migrants to Italy.-       Defendant 11 transferred into Italy the proceeds of smuggling of migrants that were still being held abroad. He did so under a modus operandi aimed at, and with the purpose of, concealing the origin of the profits. Importantly, the organised criminal group further used its resources to engage in the contraband of cigarettes and tobacco. The tobacco was received/collected in Tunisia with the purpose of being smuggled into Italy, taking advantage of the criminal enterprise set in motion in order to further smuggling of migrants activities. In this regard, the defendants kept tasks and roles aligned with the description provided above.Through investigations it became clear that this line of ‘business’ was appealing to criminals wanted by Tunisian authorities who saw in it the best option to escaping the reach of justice. The evidence gathered made it very realistic that individuals linked to the Islamic jihad could also resort to the services provided by this organised criminal group. Authorities were able to confirm at least five migrant smuggling episodes, with the following dates of arrival in Italy: (i) 10 October 2016, (ii) 20 October 2016, (iii) 3 December 2016, (iv) 18 February 2017, (v) 17 March 2017.By the same token, authorities were able to document at least two instances of tobacco contraband, which culminated in over 103 kilograms illegally introduced in Italy: (i) 1 September 2016, (ii) 17 March 2017. In establishing the fact, authorities relied muchon testimonial evidence (notably declarations of smuggled migrants and defendants) and surveillance techniques (including interception of communications and personal monitoring), and radiolocation techniques. Legal Findings:Against this background, the Public Prosecutor argued for the existence of strong indicia on the suspects’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants (associazione a delinquere). The defendants were thus indicted for migrant smuggling (for facilitation of illegal entry and or facilitation of illegal stay) and membership in an organised criminal group.The Prosecution noted the existence of a number of aggravating circumstances. Notably:-       Re membership in an organised criminal group: (i) having carried out the criminal conduct through an organised criminal group operating in more than one State, (ii) more than ten individuals having been involved in the perpetration of the crime;-       Re migrant smuggling: (i) having participated in the smuggling of five or more persons, (ii) having committed the crime in three or more individuals, (iii) purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit with the proscribed conduct. For details on the legal reasoning applied, see infra under “Commentary”. ----* Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"The case originates from investigations conducted by the Anti-Mafia Investigation Department of Milan which ended in October 2007. The main characters in this case, especially those charged with participation in an organized criminal group, are well know since the very first proceeding against organized crime in the north of Italy. This first proceeding, called ""Nord-Sud"" showed the existence of an organized criminal group in the north of Italy, but linked with the southern 'Ndrangheta, a criminal organization in Calabria.Many other proceedings occurred afterwards, until the so called Cerberus process which resulted in the accusation and conviction of an organized criminal group operating in the area around Milan. However, a part of this group regenerated and continued its activities with the accused convicted in the case of reference, with similar characteristics.Italian authorities kept on investigating on this very well structured criminal group which  operates in the construction industry and real estates’ brokerage, disrespectful of competition, market rules and legality.",other crimes,0
"The criminal organizations involved are the Chinese crime and the camorra.As to the modus operandi, the organization, made up of Chinese and Italian citizens, directed a large trafficking of counterfeited goods, made in China and other countries of Middle East and marketed in European Union countries. The huge funds produced, through a “concealed” bank were then transferred to several front trust corporations that credit them on over 70 current accounts located in different Italian credit institutions.The front trust companies, in order to justify the constant cash flow in the accounts, presented to the banks fake documents, showing the existence of contracts in cash management with Chinese nationals as owners of businesses.The cash money (figuratively connected to the trust companies) transformed into an account balance, were –through the international bank transfer system called “swift circuit”- transferred into several credit institutions located in China and subsequently used for:• Buy counterfeited products• Invest money to build new textile factories• Find stockpile warehouses in Italy• Speculate in Peking real estate market, in view of the construction works in occasion of 2008 Olympic Games.Moreover the Italian- Chinese organization, backed by consulting and tax accountants, made it possible to obtain the (fake) documents necessary to get bank loans in order to buy real estate in Italy and warehouses for the stockpile of counterfeited goods.The guarantee for the correct payment of the costs was made by letters of credit endorsed by the trust companies in charge of laundering the dirty funds.Thus, the proceeds linked to the sale of the counterfeited goods, were substituted by those out payed through the loans and the financing, giving a legal form to the illicit affairs of the transnational organization.The complex system of money laundering detected, resulted proportionate to the capacity of the criminal organization to hire the so called “white collars” that is professional public accountants, company consultants as well as unfaithful bank clerks.The tested system aimed at producing fake documents, was then used to obtain the issue and renewal of residence permit for Chinese nationals located in Italy.The case also involved legal persons in various ways responsible of the crimes detected, in particular:• Front trust companies to conceal the real owners of the laundered funds;• Companies for commercial and tax consulting service, for falsification of budgets, and to prepare fake documents in order to obtain bank loans and residence permits;• More than 30 enterprises to market counterfeited goods.The complex investigation starts from the comparative analysis between the money flows (anomalous), connected to trust companies controlled by Italian and Chinese subjects and the methods of importation (anomalous) of conspicuous shipments coming from far east Asia and from China through routes non used by the main shipping agents.In particular, considering the several anomalous transactions reports, there were many remarkable money transfers made by trust companies, that in turn concealed the activities of Chinese nationals, who were owners of businesses in the field of clothing and shoes trade, but didn’t’ appeared as importers of the same goods and first of all, were totally unknown to the inland revenue.The system adopted in order to acquire illicit wealth made it possible to trade on a large scale, inside the European Union countries, clothing, shoes of most known brands, smuggling into the market counterfeited products.The front companies, directed by commercial and tax consulting firms were owned by men of straw, and lasted only few years in order not to present the tax and customs declarations, totally evading the national and EU duties and taxes.As to the money laundering of the huge proceeds received, the method used to launder the dirty money seems very useful for the investigations:• First of all, the organization set up a real “concealed bank” , with two counters where the hundreds of Chinese sellers deposited the cash money produced by the sale of the counterfeited products. These proceeds, besides 1,5 million euros per week, were then transferred to front trust societies that in turn send them to 70 accounts located in Italian banks and credit institutions. This is the so-called “placement” phase that is to place into the market the proceeds of the alleged crime by which the criminal organization acquired the capitals, and at the same time transferred them in banking institutions, throughout a complicated series of operations of deposit, exchange, cash transfer or by purchasing goods or financial instruments. This phase is the “immersion”, necessary for the criminal groups to get rid of the cash money –proceed of crimes. The main aim of this phase is to transform the cash money into “substitute money” that is, the favourable balance of the accounts set up at the financial intermediaries, in order to divert the attention of the controlling authorities from too evident movements of money and values, both related to their amount and characteristics. In practice, in this first phase the criminal organizations carry out the subdivision of the sums deposited, throughout the opening of a series of current accounts in the same bank or in different banks, also throughout the help of dummies, in order to use different channels through which starting the procedure of make the funds legitimate. (the so-called “smurfing”);• The front trust companies, to justify the steady cash flow into the accounts, presented to credit institutions, false documents, declaring the existence of cash management contracts with Chinese nationals owners of businesses. Now we are in the phase of layering consisting in laundering (heavy soap) the illicit proceeds and clearing any direct link between the laundered funds and the criminal activity, throughout a series of financial operations carried out on the basis of fake documents. (paper trail)• The cash (connected to the trusts) transformed in account balance, was then transferred- through a system of international money transfers called “swift circuit”- to different credit institutions in China and thanks to the information gathered by the Italian liason officer in China, it was possible to determine the destination of the money used for• Purchase other counterfeited products• To invest money in order to build new textile factories• Find stockpile warehouses in Italy• Speculate in Peking real estate market.This is the last money laundering phase called “integration” , it is when the money or other assets are “integrated” into the legal circuit and made available for the criminal group to use them. The illicit origin, also geographical, has been already hidden.The methods used to make the funds legitimate are only seemingly legal. (purchase of estate or companies, businesses and financial institutions) and it becomes difficult to determine and to recognize the dirty operation from the clean ones. This phase is called spin dry or repatriation.Moreover, the Italian- Chinese organization, backed by consulting and tax accountants, made it possible to obtain the (fake) documents necessary to get bank loans in order to buy real estate in Italy and warehouses for the stockpile of counterfeited goods.The guarantee for the correct payment of the costs was made by letters of credit endorsed by the trust companies in charge of laundering the dirty funds.Thus, the proceeds linked to the sale of the counterfeited goods were substituted by those out payed through the loans and the financing, giving a legal form to the illicit affairs of the transnational organization.As to the origin and the distribution of the huge amount of textile, shoes, the chain started in China where the manufacture factories were located.The goods were then shipped in containers, and arrived in middle east ports, received false documents of origin, in order to pass the customs control and to avoid the limits provided for in EU to protect the textile and shoe sector.The product then, arrived to the ports of EU (Anversa, Hamburg and Marseille) to be distributed all over Europe, after the labelling (application of fake brands), made in Italy in laboratories controlled by the O.C. i.e. camorra.It was possible to determine the routes made by the counterfeited products , smuggled into Italy, thanks to the refined systems used by the Italian Port authority; through the international identification code given to all the boats, and the support received by the foreign authorities, it was possible to prove that the trips originated from China , not from middle east ports, as written in the fake declarations to the customs.The customs agency obtained from the insurance maritime companies the policies related to the single shippings, thus making possible to confirm the exact routes followed by the cargo.At the same time, due to the cooperation with the Customs agency, it was possible to determine all the shippings of suspicious origin; a large scale international information network was created.The European coordination was guarantee by the Antimafia District Attorney’s directions in Rome and Naples through meeting at Eurojust.As said before, during the 2 years long investigation, new alliances between Italian camorra and Chinese crime were detected.The camorra, beside labelling with fake brands the goods in laboratories in Campania, found the warehouses , as well as the businesses where the goods were sold, imposing a kickback for each piece of clothing given.Through interceptions it was possible to find a dangerous camorra fugitive (wanted for over 12 years) who, from a safe hideaway in Venezuela, sent orders to direct the laundering of money.The arrest was conducted in cooperation with Interpol and Venezuela police forces.The present investigation is an example because is based on the overcome of the traditional methods of investigating (focusing on the commission of a crime), to use methods based on the control of money flows and the illicit ways of capital accumulation.The analysis and control of capital movements is essential to effectively counter o.c., in any scale of the crime scheme. From a simple profit or the control over a business in order to gain a living, to a real activity aimed at financing and enlarging a criminal organization, that operating over its national borders, becomes a new transnational criminality directed more and more as a real company from an entrepreneurial point of view.The reduction of risks and the maximization of profits, represent the current criteria to manage the criminal activity , that through the input of the proceeds of crime into the legal economy, can cause serious damages to the economic system, in particular to the principle of free competition and to the stability of the financial international markets.At the basis, the markets globalization, on one hand gives new chances for the economic growth, and on the other makes the system more permeable to the penetration of crime groups and thus a more urgent need arouses to elaborate countering techniques and instruments.The detection, seizure, and confiscation of assets, appear in this framework, as the most effective instruments to dismantle the productive cycle of mafia enterprise, apart from the criminal sector where the money comes or is direct to.In order to obtain this, the procedures connected to the suspicious transactions reports are made stricter for those individuals, working outside but close to the banking institutions and first of all for the legal and accounting sectors, emphasizing the obligations to the “due diligence” and “know your customer”.",other crimes,0
"Our investigation originated from two alerts from the Central Directorate for Anti-Drugs Services (D.C.S.A.) forwarded to us by the General Command – II Unit. These alerts reported the seizure of a total amount of 1,900 kilos of cocaine in May 2005 and March 2006 in Martinique and Guadalupe.The drugs were found on a sailing boat and on a catamaran used by traffickers from Naples. After a careful analysis of the data provided by the Central Directorate, we formulated a number of investigative hypotheses and launched inquiries authorized by the Antimafia District Directorate (D.D.A.) of Naples and involving phone tapping. Our inquiries finally revealed the existence in Naples of a criminal organisation involved in the importation into Italy of large quantities of cocaine and hashish originating from South America and Spain. During our investigation it was also established that the criminal organisation under scrutiny was trying to smuggle huge quantities of hashish from Morocco to Spain. As the hashish was destined for the illegal market in Campania, it was to be shipped to Italy on a vessel identified by the investigating officers.After a long organisational phase necessary to fine-tune the logistical aspects of the drug trafficking operations which were constantly monitored by the investigating officers, the organisation was set to transfer the above-mentioned boat to the Spanish coasts. In order to collect detailed information about the movements of the vessel and to identify the landing port in Spain, on 31th July 2007 our Command set up a long-range ship-tracking system operated by the Operative Aeronaval Command (C.O.A.N.) of Pratica di Mare. Given the need to constantly monitor the suspects’ movements and to gather in real time any useful information about the various stages of the drug smuggling process and especially about the boat’s journey back to the Italian territorial waters once it had been loaded with drugs, with the support of the D.C.S.A. and the General Command – II Unit, our Command implemented police cooperation with the Spanish Vigilanza Aduanera. This allowed officers from the Investigative Group on Organised Crime (G.I.C.O.), with the constant support of vessels of the C.O.A.N., to carry out surveillance, close monitoring and tracking activities in Spain from 7th Aug.2007 to 29th Sept. 2009. We immediately established direct contacts with officers of the Vigilanza Aduanera in Malaga. Thanks to the constant flow of information promptly provided by the officers of our G.I.C.O. as it emerged during the inquiries, on the morning of 19 Oct. 2007 the Spanish authorities intercepted the above-mentioned vessel off the coasts of Puerto de la Duquesa (E), seized around 1,800 kilos of hashish and arrested three people, two from Naples and one Spanish citizen. The Spanish authorities were informed beforehand that a high-ranking officer and operatives from our service were deployed in the area to ensure smooth exchange of information and coordination of law enforcement activities in Spanish territory. Moreover, non-stop technical surveillance (phone tapping and bugging) allowed us to identify a villa in Castelldefels (E) with a “hidden compartment” where the organisation used to store drugs smuggled into Spain. On 2nd Nov. 2007, after the investigating judicial authority in Naples had submitted a formal request for legal assistance to its Spanish counterpart, staff from our G.I.C.O. and from the Squadra Mobile (C.I.D.) of Naples (who were inquiring simultaneously into cases of extortion committed by clan members) travelled to Castelldefels to assist officers of the local Vigilanza Aduanera during the search of the villa and contributed to the discovery of around another 860 kilos of hashish, part of which was concealed in the garage in the above-mentioned “hidden compartment” while the rest was found inside a Volkswagen Touareg car, as well as 6.9 kilos of marijuana.The investigation continued with inquiries into the finances and assets of members of the criminal organisation and their families so as to prevent the commonly used subterfuge of hiding the ‘unjustified’ availability of resources actually belonging to individuals under investigation by registering all assets and other valuables in the name of third parties. Thanks to searches in the databases available to our service and to data provided by a number of financial authorities, we carefully analysed and compared the tax returns submitted by all suspects as personal income tax payers and company tax payers with their assets and financial status as reflected by their lifestyle in order to reveal any excessive difference between living expenses and known sources of income or funds. Our analysis showed a blatant difference between assets owned and income declared, so it could be easily assumed that some of the funds available to suspects did not originate from known sources of income but were likely to be derived from drug trafficking. Based on this evidence we suggested that the investigating Judicial Authority should request the freezing of all assets available to suspects, their family members or in-laws.This request led to the issuing of a preventative seizure order under art. 321 c.c.p. for the following assets with a view to their subsequent confiscation under art. 12, clause 6, of Legislative Decree 306/92: 11 properties (including a luxury villa in Spain); 50 vehicles (cars, motorcycles, lorries and craft); 4 businesses; 25 life insurance policies; 9 bank accounts and post office accounts, with a total value of around €10 million.To this end the Italian Judicial Authority submitted a request for judicial assistance in criminal matters (under art. 15(4) of the European Convention concluded at Strasbourg on 20 April 1959) in order to obtain the seizure of property and movable assets used by the criminal organisation on Spanish soil and listed in the above-mentioned court order.The conclusion of the investigation produced the following results:• 33 individuals were reported to the Italian judicial authorities on suspicion of involvement in the offences referred to in articles 73 and 74 of Pres. Decree 309/1990 and articles 3 and 4 of Law 146/2006; three of them were caught committing the offence in Spain and arrested by Spanish law enforcement authorities;• 2,860 kilos of hashish and 6.918 kilos of marijuana, 1 boat, 5 cars, 2 motorcycles and 1 property were seized in Spain;• 8 individuals at the top of the chain of command of the criminal organisation were imprisoned pending trial under an order for pre-trial detention issued by the Judge for Preliminary Investigations (G.I.P.) of the Court of Naples.• a preventative seizure order under art. 321 c.c.p. was issued at the end of targeted financial investigations for the following assets with a view to their confiscation under art. 12, clause 6, of Legislative Decree 306/1992: 11 properties, 50 vehicles (cars, motorcycles, lorries and craft), 4 businesses, 25 life insurance policies and 9 bank accounts and post office accounts, worth a total of around €10 million.",other crimes,0
"Citizens resident in Poland, namely in Chelm, a town in the province of Lublin (at the border with Ukraine) were identified as the leaders of the organization. The presence of individuals dealing with international smuggling of foreign manufactured tobaccos from Ukraine has been proved in the said area. Among them, we mention in particular:LB and LA (LB’s husband). The investigation carried out with the aid of bugging operations have proved the role of the said individuals in leading the other members of the criminal group with the following aims:1) Purchase of foreign manufactured tobaccos (mostly Marlboro and L&M, both red and white package) in the near former Soviet Republic, to be brought to Poland for storage;2) Arranging freight forwarding to Milan, including carriers and trucks. It is worth mentioning here the special attention paid in arranging trucks and/or commercial vehicles.In particular, each individual plays a different role within the criminal organization. Among all, LB has an outstanding role as organizer of the operational activities within the organization with which she shared the wrongful aims.“LB”, helped by her husband LA, stands out for the following reasons:a) The role played in organizing, directing and controlling the unlawful activities related to the transnational smuggling of foreign manufactured tobaccos from Ukraine to Poland. The woman is known as “dominus” (leader) within the organization, as it emerges from the constant flow of telephone calls during which the organization members took orders, reported difficulties and provided for updated information.Her outstanding role is confirmed by the journey from Poland to Italy she made in order to reaffirm her leadership and try to return the situation seriously affected by the seizure of assets to normal. She also wanted to understand the reasons for that in order to take adequate measures (there is a serious concern over moles hiding within the organization).Finally, due to the concern expressed by her carriers and their refusal to “land” on the market of Milan, considered as a dangerous, no longer suitable place for their activity, Bozena makes a real feasibility study regarding the town of Verona. She involved her fellow citizen ST in assessing size, potential expansion and output of a “virgin” market such as the town of Verona.b) She set up an organization which, although rudimentary, aimed at smuggling to Italy a considerable amount of foreign manufactured tobaccos by- recruiting and affiliating individuals at different times, also mixing them with individuals who have not been fully identified;- establishing stable and professional relationships with smugglers in order to commit a great number of crimes of tobacco smuggling, punished according to Art. 291 bis D.P.R. no. 43 of 23 January 1973;In particular, the team set up by LB is made up of following individuals:- Providers of tobacco from the near Republic of Ukraine (tobaccos from Ukraine are temporarily stored in Poland before being smuggled to Italian and foreign markets, where the offer of illegal good is lucrative for the organization);- Individuals responsible for freight forwarding during all its phases, going back and forth and provided with their own truck fleet either belonging to them or registered under front men’s name. In this way they evade the rules provided for by Art. 301 1 para. of D.P.R. no. 43 of 23 January 1973 concerning the confiscation of assets.- Couriers who are especially trained to assume full responsibility for the freight in case of “mishaps” (detections, controls, arrests and seizures). These individuals are ready to mislead the investigative bodies as they can rely on the prompt intervention and legal aid provided by the criminal organization;- Consignees of tobacco freights/consignments on the market of Milan, who have lived in the Lombardy’s chief town for long, some of them also without a regular permit of stay.The individuals listed below were identified as those being responsible for freight forwarding during all its phases:- DK- SR- MB- KJAs already mentioned, DK, SR, MB, KJ ensure that each transport from Poland to Italy be carried out under their responsibility (are responsible for). The above mentioned individuals, ranked immediately lower than their leaders in the organization, care for arranging the freight forwarding. In particular, they- Provide for the transport of smuggled goods (in vans and occasionally in commercial vehicles and articulated lorries) especially arranged and carrying cover freights, consisting of goods of poor quality and of low fiscal impact. On those occasions, they turned out to be sly and creative, especially as regards coverups such as the following ones:- Modification to the car floor (mostly space wagons) with the body shell being itself a hiding place;- Use of trailers and caravans in summertime, driven by a whole family, pretending to go on holiday together with its child.- Transport of industrial machinery (equipment for yoghurt production and air conditioners) especially provided with electric opening devices aimed at making freight unloading faster and police controls more difficult;- Transport in articulated lorries of a cover freight consisting of cloth rolls and foodstuffs in bags placed on pallets;- Accompanying documents such as invoices and customs documents, that turn out to be false in most cases.The said individuals are responsible for freight forwarding to organization leaders and goods owners.Namely, they- Manage the transport as it happens, carefully avoiding any direct contact with the freight and using radio equipments to avoid the risk of being detected. By doing so, they get a sort of self-protection for themselves and the other organization members.- co-ordinate the local distribution of smuggled tobaccos onto the market, raking the illicit profits.CouriersCouriers rank third as drivers of vans and commercial vehicles carrying tobacco freights. These are usually registered under front men’s names.The criminal organization employed a number of persons acting as carriers for the illicit transport of foreign manufactured tobaccos. Among them the following ones were arrested and identified in the operations carried out:WTJ TML TDS MKWJJM (alias LUCJAN) TJ (alias JAREK)DJW (alias JUREK) DK (DJW’s wife)RK KMGT CSSBR FMKR WMJIP NPAll of them were especially trained in routes and destinations. They were also warned they should not disclose anything to law enforcement agencies in the unhappy event of being taken into custody or arrested.Indeed, they were always calm and confident in the event of seizure or arrest, being aware they could rely on the organization’s support, which regularly happened, especially in terms of legal aid and logistical and financial support.Consignees of foreign manufactured tobaccosAt the bottom of the organization structure there are the buyers on the Milan market. During the said period, these preferred to provide themselves with tobaccos smuggled via Poland, although they supply themselves through various channels. Following persons were identified during the investigation:The above mentioned, despite their different origin, social and cultural background, set up unusual relationships. This may be due to the fact that, being active on the same market, they are attracted by the great chances of making easy money in the face of relatively low personal risk related to performing the illegal activity.SMH HA (Abi)MN MBM (alias Mimmo)HY NVTW STHLD KIThe above mentioned, despite their different origin, social and cultural background, set up unusual relationships. This may be due to the fact that, being active on the same market, they are attracted by the great chances of making easy money in the face of relatively low personal risk related to performing the illegal activity.SMH (Poland)  <- -> HA (Morocco)MBM (Egypt)  <- -> MN (Russia)NV (Rumania)  <- -> HY (Ucraine)STH (Poland)  <- -> TW (Morocco)In particular, the investigation carried out shows that some Polish women investigated for smuggling have set up unusual relationships with nationals from North Africa, combining love and business, although having their own families in their home country. They keep for themselves the key role of arranging the consignments of manufactured tobaccos from Poland, while leaving the Maghrebis the task of storing and sorting out tobacco consignments.In many different occasions the said subjects have been working closer - being involved in the same smuggled tobaccos’ freight forwarding – while in other cases women in particular were rather upset for a sort of “unfair competition”. Everyone was trying to interfere with others’ business in an effort to keep control on the cargo and the carriers (couriers) coming from Poland.It should be mentioned, moreover, that considerable income losses resulting from seizure of forwarded consignments following to our operations, have sometimes caused the criminal organization’s members to argue, complaining to each other about the lack of efficiency which led to seizures. This assumption is confirmed by relevant wire tapping.Investigations could reveal that smugglers were used to frequently receive relatively small consignments, up to 200 to 1000 kg., delivered from Poland almost every week, thus being able to:- pay small amounts of money by each freight forwarding;- use mostly garages located in Milan;- allow a quick rotation of warehouse goods, permanently complying with the needs of the illegal market.In this way, suppliers were in a lower danger of being traced on the criminal route; in addition, they could keep small amounts of stocked goods in Poland (losses being then strictly material and registered/mortgaged in the short term).",other crimes,0
"JF and JE, husband and wife, were both convicted of aggravated human trafficking and facilitating illegal entry. JF was also convicted of drug related offences.The couple, in collaboration with organised criminal groups operating transnationally, were involved in the recruitment, transportation and harbouring of two Nigerian girls (victim1 and victim2), one of whom was a minor,  in order to employ them in the Italian prostitution market and profit from them financially. The victims’ journey from Nigeria to Italy involved the crossing of Niger and Libya and was organised and paid for by the defendants. The fee for transportation ranged from 15.000,00 to 25.000,00 euros, which the girls had to pay back through their work.   The victims were repeatedly subjected to physical violence at the hands of both defendants and were constantly threatened. Before leaving Nigeria, the victims were forced to undergo a voodoo ritual. This meant they believed that if they were to escape, not repay their debt or talk to the police they would be killed, or their families would be harmed. The defendants had different roles within the criminal activity. JE took care of the recruitment of the girls, the voodoo rituals, the organisation of transport to Italy and payment to the criminal groups. She also acted as a ‘madame’, teaching the girls how to solicit customers and how much they should charge the clients. She was responsible for deflowering victim 1 with a banana and threatened the families of the victims after the police raided the house where they were staying and took them to secure accommodation.JF took care of arranging transportation of the victims to Catania and personally pick up the victims and took them to the house he shared with his wife.  He was also in charge of the ‘bookkeeping’ and annotating the respective amounts received by the girls. Based on the testimony of both victims , the evidence collected through phone call surveillance and wiretapping of the prison meetings between JF and his wife, the claims of the defendants, who argued they only rented a room to the girls and knew nothing about their prostitution, were deemed to be false. On 7.10.2019 they were both convicted to 10 years imprisonment and immediate expulsion from Italy upon completion of the sentence.",smuggling of migrants,1
"Subject of this case are a series of decisions taken by the Court of preliminary investigations of Palermo and the prosecutor’s office, deciding upon the arrest and detention (or to the prolongation of the detention) of three suspects for the charges of human trafficking, torture, murder, sexual assault, enabling clandestine migration and kidnapping of hundreds of men, women and children in Libya. The three suspects were accused of forming an organized criminal group and using an abandoned military base as an illegal “prison” in Libya, where migrants were forcibly detained, tortured, beaten and abused in order to coerce them or their families into paying a “liberation fee”. If no payment was made, then victims would either be tortured, killed, or sold to other traffickers for the purpose of sexual or labour exploitation. The head of the organization, a Libyan national, was responsible for running the prison and coordinating with different actors of the organization, including taxi drivers and local police officers who would deliver victims to the prison or other traffickers that would sell victims to the organization. The two other suspects, a Guinean and an Egyptian national, worked as armed prison guards, regularly abusing detainees and occasionally torturing and killing them. All suspects arrived irregularly to Italy, together with 56 other migrants who were rescued by an NGO off the Libyan coast. The suspects continuously denied allegations and claimed they were themselves held prisoners in the facility. Six victims, all of which had spent several months detained by the suspects, came forward and recognized them as the one responsible running / working in the illegal prison. Victims also mentioned several other individuals, all male from different nationalities, that were involved in the criminal organization.",smuggling of migrants,1
"IC was convicted of: heading and running an organised criminal network for the purposes of human trafficking; aggravated human trafficking; heading and running an organised criminal network for the purposes of facilitating illegal immigration; facilitating illegal immigration.   PG was convicted of two offences, namely: aggravated human trafficking and facilitating illegal immigration.   In collaboration with organised criminal groups operating transnationally, IC and PG were involved in the recruitment, transportation and harbouring of young Nigerian women in order to exploit them for use in the Italian prostitution market and in that of several other European countries (Belgium, Germany, UK, and Spain) and to procure such young girls for third-party ‘madames’ throughout Europe, and profit from them financially.   The victims’ journey from Nigeria to Italy involved the crossing of Niger and Libya and was possible due to the defendants’ close relationship with Libyan traffickers with whom they were in constant contact at every stage of the young women’s journey. This was very well coordinated and involved military like control, corruption of border authorities and para-entrepreneurial planning.    IC and PG took care of the transportation fee, and charged the victims up to 45,000 euros, which the women had to pay back through their work. The defendants also provided the women with the ‘story’ to tell to the authorities in order to get relevant residence documents.   Before leaving Nigeria, the victims were forced to undergo a voodoo ritual. This meant they believed that if they were to escape, not repay their debt or talk to the police they would be killed, or their families would be harmed. This gave the defendants very useful leverage over the young women.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The Court of Agrigento examined the request to validate the arrest of Carole Rackete on grounds of alleged offences pertaining to Art. 1100 Naval Code on acts of resistance or violence against a warship and resistance to a public official (Art. 337 of the Italian Criminal Code) related to her conduct of 29 June 2019 when entering the port of Lampedusa. The Court rejected the request to validate the arrest of Carola Rackete, as well as the protective measure of prohibition of stay in the province of Agrigento. The decision invokes the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and especially Art. 98 UNCLOS (duty to render assistance), as well as the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR), but also the general principle of international law “pact sunt servanda”. In this respect, the decision stresses that these provisions are translated and reinforced in Italian domestic law, whereby Art. 1158 of the Naval Code imposes criminal sanctions to masters of ships -national or foreign- that do not render assistance to ships found in difficulty as per Art. 490 of the Naval Code. The decision underlines that from Art. 10 of Decree 286/98 derives an obligation for state authorities and commanders of ships to render assistance and rescue foreigners that have entered the territory of the State even in an irregular manner following rescue at sea operations. Furthermore, with regard to the violation of article 1100 of the Naval Code, the court found that the naval unit of the Guardia di Finanza which was rammed by the Sea Watch captained by Carola Rackete does not fall within the category of “warship” as specified in the provision; as a consequence, the conduct could not be framed under the aforementioned article. The decision stresses that ""the principle of the freedom of states to regulate the flows of entry into their national territory (expression of sovereignty)"" should be in line with ""the limits deriving from customary law and from the limits that the state undertakes by adhering to international treaties"", among which are ""the duty of render assistance to ships in difficulty and rescue persons at sea and the obligation, on the part of the state authorities, to provide first aid and assistance to foreigners who have entered, even irregularly, the territory of the state"". In conclusion the Court found that the alleged offences under Art. 1100 Naval were not substantiated and that the offences under Art. 337 of the Italian Criminal Code are not sustained, as the actions of the accused were in line with Art. 51 of the Italian Criminal Code, which exempts from punishment those who are acting in accordance with a duty imposed by the rule of law or a legitimate order of public authority.",smuggling of migrants,1
"This is a decision sustaining the pre-trial detention order issued against Deji Gift. The proceedings relate to well structured, transnational criminal organisation operating between Libya (city of Sabhah) and Italy of Ghanaians, Nigerians and Libyans, active in trafficking in persons, facilitation of illegal immigration and commission of serious crimes related to criminal association for kidnapping for extortion, murder and sexual violence. The group was active in migration routes in Africa (Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Guinea) kidnapping migrants in order to profit financially and materially by - what the Court calls - trafficking of contemporary slaves. The modus operandi was based on conspiracy, distinct functions and roles of the members of the group, kidnaping of migrants and payment of ransom to dedicated accounts, using firearms and continuous violence aimed at subjugating and reducing migrants to trafficking and enslavement, sexual violence against women, physical and psychological violence, exchange of control with other groups. This case is linked to criminal proceedings RGNR 3930/2017 (accused were John Ogais and Sam Eric Ackom, who were found guilty for kidnapping, sexual violence, homicide, facilitating irregular migration, and were sentenced to life imprisonment in 2018)  where several of the facts were ascertained.The accused Deji Gift – who was later convicted at secondary level to 24 years of imprisonment- is the third accused in the criminal organisation formed with John Ogais and Sam Ackom, that kidnapped, tortured and sexually abused migrants in Libya en route to Italy. His name surfaced during hearings of migrants witnesses during the proceedings of  RGNR 3930/2017. Multiples testimonies speak about killing and torturing of migrants, raping and sexually abusing women migrants. According to witnesses’ testimonies, the accused was detained and then turned into a torturer.The decision elaborates on exercise of jurisdiction to Italian courts of the alleged offences in accordance with Art. 10 of the Italian Criminal Court and of Art. 3-4  of Law 146/2006 related to offences committed entirely abroad and in more than one country. Reference is also made to UNTOC and Art. 3 (2). The Court ordered the detention of the accused for offences related to a) Article 416 of the Italian Criminal Code and Article 4 of Law 146/2006 in association with Eric Ackom and John Ogais in order to commit several crimes against the person - and in particular crimes of trafficking in persons (Article 601 of the Italian Criminal Code), kidnapping of aggravated persons (Article 630, paragraph 3) c.p.), sexual violence (art. 609 bis c.p.); with the aggravating circumstances; b) Article 110 and 630 of the Italian Criminal Code for depriving migrants of freedom, kidnapping, repeatedly mistreating and torturing migrants (with rubber tubes and electric cables), committing sexual violence against women of the group. Aggravating circumstances were included in the case, i.e. death of kidnapped persons.",smuggling of migrants,1
"Between the years of 2015 and 2016, the Somalian defendant in the case, Matammud Osman, on behalf of a large transnational organized criminal group, was charged with procuring the illegal entry of hundreds of migrants to Italy. Their journey, on board minibuses and vessels, often in precarious conditions, was escorted by armed men of the organization. The journey began in Somalia, continued through Ethiopia, Sudan and Libya, with the final destination being the Italian coasts. Throughout the 2-years prolonged criminal activity, the defendant was in charge of two illegal detention camps in Libya: Bani Walid and Sabratah. Inside these camps, hundreds of Somali citizens, women, men and also minors, were kept prisoners and held in often precarious hygienic conditions. Migrants were completely deprived of their personal freedom, having no opportunity to escape. On a daily basis - as a way to punish the non-payment of the sum agreed for the smuggling operation (in most cases around 7,000 USD) - the defendant and his co-conspiritors would regularly go inside the camps to take Somali male citizens to a ""torture room"". There, they were tortured through electric shocks, whips, hit with sticks and iron bars, or left for hours dehydrated under the sun, causing them fractures and in some cases even death. Another type of violence, allegedly perpetrated by the defendant and his men towards migrants, was to cause severe burns by setting fire to plastic bags that were placed on the migrants' backs. These acts of torture were perpetuated in order to give a ""warning"" to other prisoners about the consequences to which they would be exposed in case of rebellion or in case their payment would not come on time.The inhuman and degrading treatments committed against women, on the other hand, were mainly of sexual nature. The victims, many of them minors at the time, experienced rape and other sexual violence on a daily basis. The defendant, through threats of death and physical violence (beating them with fists, kicks, with a belt and with sticks), prevented them from any possibility of movement and would then, since some of them were infibulated girls, open their vaginas with metal instruments in order to penetrate them for the first time.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The defendant was deemed to be a member of a transnational organised criminal group (composed mostly of Somali, Sudanese and Libyan individuals)dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons. In order to achieve these goals, the organised criminal group further engaged in a series of connected and ‘auxiliary’ crimes, namely kidnapping with the purpose of extortion and homicide. The activities of this criminal group occurred mostly in Libya (city of Kufrà) and Italy.The defendant’s role within the said organised criminal group was that of – being armed - monitoring and keeping surveillance over migrants that had been kidnapped and maintained in a slavery-like situation, in a structure known as Hudeyfà (Libya). In so doing, he committed a series of offences against the physical and psychological integrity of migrants. Specifically, upon reaching Libya from their respective countries of origin, the migrants would be coercively detained in Hudeifà. All their possessions were taken by the smugglers. The smugglers would then demand their families for a ransom for their release (up to 5250 USD) and or the fee deemed appropriate for continuation of the journey to Italy. The payments would then occur via the Hawala method. Some migrants declared that the defendant would request the ransom added of 250 USD, which he would directly usurp. Sometimes, the smugglers would torture the migrants and make their families hear their screams over the phone. Once the payments were received, the migrants would either be abandoned in Libya or sold to other smugglers that would facilitate the journey to Italy. Movements between sites occurred by truck or bus.During the kidnapping period, water and food lacked. The migrants were abused and mistreated. This would happen including when they asked for more water or food.  Some, evidenced by marks of torture on their bodies. At least three migrants presented lesions and scars in the abdomen and back consistent with torture imposed via electric cables. Others, declared to have been beaten up with a rubber stick. On 26 May 2017, 307 individuals (including the defendant) were rescued from a vessel*, close to the Libyan coast, by a tugboat. On 27 May 2017, these persons arrived to the port of Lampedusa (Italy) on board of a ship of the Coast Guard that had recovered the said individuals from the tugboat. They were then transferred to the Hotspot of Lampedusa for screening and photograph taking. Following the appropriate assessment, it emerged the 307 migrants did not fulfil the legal requirements to enter and stay in Italy. They were thus irregular migrants. Most migrants were minors.Upon questioning, five migrants declared to have been kidnapped in Kufrà and confirmed the role of the defendant in the context of the organised criminal group that had arranged for their journey to Italy. They further declared that, once in Lampedusa, the defendant had threatened some of them not to give incriminating declarations against him. To others, he had asked for forgiveness. The migrants remained afraid and intimidated.Some migrants declared that deaths had occurred amongst the kidnapped migrants, either due to disease or as a result of torture and mi-treatment. Likewise, some migrants stated to have been told that, before their arrival to the ‘safe house’, few migrants had managed to escape. However, they had been recaptured and killed in front of the other migrants. In establishing the fact, authorities relied muchon testimonial evidence (notably declarations of several smuggled migrants in Lampedusa) and identification of the defendant via photographs. Documentary evidence – notably, photographs of torture marks – taken by the police with the assistance of medical staff was of much importance. These photographs were complemented with expert medical reports. Investigations continued re other alleged members of the organised criminal group. At least one migrant declared that it was planned for other members of the organised criminal group to travel to Europe, from Nigeria, attempting to pass as smuggled migrants. Legal Findings:Against this background, the Public Prosecutor argued for the existence of strong indicia on the defendant’s membership in a transnational organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants (associazione a delinquere). The defendant was thus indicted for migrant smuggling, membership in an organised criminal group, trafficking in persons, and kidnapping with the purpose of extortion.The Prosecution noted the existence of a number of aggravating circumstances. Notably:-       Re membership in an organised criminal group: (i) having carried out the criminal conduct through an organised criminal group operating in more than one State, (ii) more than ten individuals having been involved in the perpetration of the crime;-       Re migrant smuggling: (i) having participated in the smuggling of five or more persons, (ii) having committed the crime in three or more individuals, (iii) purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit with the proscribed conduct, (iv) endangering the life or safety of migrants, (v) submitting migrant to degrading or inhuman treatment. For details on the legal reasoning applied, see infra under “Commentary”. ----* Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)). Accordingly, it comprises unseaworthy ships and boats in precarious conditions.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The defendants were deemed to be members of an organised criminal group dedicated to systematically smuggling migrants from Tunisia to Italy (via Sicily) and, eventually, to other locations in Europe. The organised criminal group facilitated the illegal entry, transit and stay of irregular migrants in Italy (and other European countries, especially France and Belgium) with the purpose of obtaining profit (average of 2000 Euro per person). The smuggling venture was carried out via speed-vessels* and it targeted relatively well-off North African nationals. In addition, the organised criminal group was also involved in tobacco contraband and money laundering.The organised criminal group was well structured, whereby each member had determined tasks assigned. Specifically:-       Defendant 1 was the leader of the organised criminal group, managing and directing it in Tunisia. This entailed (i) collecting and receiving payments, (ii) interacting with interested clients (i.e. migrants to be smuggled), (iii) providing for the necessary means of transport to carry out the planned smuggling ventures from Tunisia to the coast of Italy, (iv) recruiting individuals to master the vessels, (v) reception of, and ‘care’ for the migrants in Italy, (vi) arranging for the eventual continuation of the smuggling venture to other European countries, (vii) managing the proceeds of smuggling activities, including by acquiring new means of transportation (vessels).-       Around 6 September 2016, Defendant 2 provided her husband (i.e. Defendant 1) the funds necessary to acquire vessels to engage in the smuggling ventures.-       Defendants 2, 3 and 4 assisted Defendant 1 in the organisation and promotion of the organised criminal group, especially following the detention of Defendant 1 on 20 October 2016. They were ‘right arms’ of Defendant 1.-       Defendants 5 and 16 were charged in particular with the specifics of acquiring new sea-craft and liaising with in-land associates so as to ensure the reception and ‘care’ of migrants once in Sicily.-       The remaining defendants – all operating in Sicily, in particular in the provinces of Trapani, Agrigento and Palermo – acted under the direct instructions of the ‘organisers’ by receiving/collecting/orienting the smuggled migrants upon their arrival in Italy. They further managed and or directly received payments as well as served as intermediaries between irregular migrants and smugglers operating in other areas that could assist in facilitating the transit to the desired areas/countries of destination. These defendants also provided, if needed, logistical support, e.g. accommodation, transportation in view of future movements.-       Defendants 7 and 14 directly helmed vessels transporting an undetermined number of migrants to Italy.-       Defendant 11 transferred into Italy the proceeds of smuggling of migrants that were still being held abroad. He did so under a modus operandi aimed at, and with the purpose of, concealing the origin of the profits. Importantly, the organised criminal group further used its resources to engage in the contraband of cigarettes and tobacco. The tobacco was received/collected in Tunisia with the purpose of being smuggled into Italy, taking advantage of the criminal enterprise set in motion in order to further smuggling of migrants activities. In this regard, the defendants kept tasks and roles aligned with the description provided above.Through investigations it became clear that this line of ‘business’ was appealing to criminals wanted by Tunisian authorities who saw in it the best option to escaping the reach of justice. The evidence gathered made it very realistic that individuals linked to the Islamic jihad could also resort to the services provided by this organised criminal group. Authorities were able to confirm at least five migrant smuggling episodes, with the following dates of arrival in Italy: (i) 10 October 2016, (ii) 20 October 2016, (iii) 3 December 2016, (iv) 18 February 2017, (v) 17 March 2017.By the same token, authorities were able to document at least two instances of tobacco contraband, which culminated in over 103 kilograms illegally introduced in Italy: (i) 1 September 2016, (ii) 17 March 2017. In establishing the fact, authorities relied muchon testimonial evidence (notably declarations of smuggled migrants and defendants) and surveillance techniques (including interception of communications and personal monitoring), and radiolocation techniques. Legal Findings:Against this background, the Public Prosecutor argued for the existence of strong indicia on the suspects’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants (associazione a delinquere). The defendants were thus indicted for migrant smuggling (for facilitation of illegal entry and or facilitation of illegal stay) and membership in an organised criminal group.The Prosecution noted the existence of a number of aggravating circumstances. Notably:-       Re membership in an organised criminal group: (i) having carried out the criminal conduct through an organised criminal group operating in more than one State, (ii) more than ten individuals having been involved in the perpetration of the crime;-       Re migrant smuggling: (i) having participated in the smuggling of five or more persons, (ii) having committed the crime in three or more individuals, (iii) purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit with the proscribed conduct. For details on the legal reasoning applied, see infra under “Commentary”. ----* Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"This decision relates to the activities of an organised criminal group (associazione a delinquere) dedicated inter alia to migrant smuggling and trafficking in human being for sexual exploitation. The organised criminal group operated in Nigeria, Maghreb countries (especially Libya) and Italy (Lampedusa, Agrigento, Palermo, Reggio Calabria, Napoli, Padova). The investigations unveiled the membership of the defendants in the organised criminal group and its activities. Investigations are on-going to identify other members thereof. In its order for precautionary detention, the Public Prosecutor identified four defendants: J.O., O.G.A., E.C. and I.B. (see Proc. Nr. 3714/2016 R.G.N.R.). Only J.O. and I.B. are subjects in the decision herein analysed.It was ascertained as follows:Defendant J.O. (a.k.a. V.) holds a dominant position within the associazione a delinquere. She managed direct contacts regarding the recruitment of women in Nigeria, overseeing their transport to Italy in order to be affected to prostitution in several regions of the country as well as abroad.Defendant I.B. (together with E.C.) was in charge of the transportation of the victims to different regions in Italy and their accommodation (where they were often coerced to remain). He further took on the management of several logistical aspects (e.g. telephones, vehicles) necessary to the pursuance of the objectives of the organised criminal group, notably prostitution.The women were controlled much via voodoo rituals (set up by O.G.A.). Three victims were identified. From their statements it emerged this case regards a situation that started as a typical scenario of migrant smuggling: the migrant contacts the smuggler or follows-up on his or her contact in order to arrange for the trip to another country, in the hope of improving life conditions. Progressively, it develops into trafficking in human beings. Indeed, the victims wished to come to Italy, though they were not aware of the intent of the organised criminal group to affect them to prostitution. It was established as follows:The victims agreed to engage in a 30 000 Euro debt with the smugglers corresponding to their trip to Italy and other related expenses. The victims were allured with prospects of regular work in Italy.The agreement was celebrated via voodoo rituals, which inculcated particular fear in the victims and strongly contributed to keeping them attached to the associazione a delinquere.The victims were transported to Libya and kept reclusive against their will in a house, while waiting for being transferred to Italy.In Libya, the victims were informed they would be affected to prostitution in order to pay the debts related to their travel. The victims refused and declared to wish to return to Nigeria, which they were not allowed. They were repeatedly threatened and intimidated, including through voodoo invocation. They received SIM cards to contact J.O. once arrived in Italy.The victims were transported by vessel* to Italy. They arrived to Lampedusa (Italy) on 3 May 2015. They were led to the reception centre of Siculiana (Italy), where they remain until 9 May 2015.  One of the victims (who later pressed charges) left the reception centre under the protection of the International Organisation of Migration to be integrated in a community in Favara (Italy). She was later induced to prostitution by the organised criminal group, via threats and intimidation. The others were picked up by associated of J.O. and taken to the house where they would be prostituted.On 1 March 2016, the victims managed to leave the house of J.O. in Reggio Calabria (Italy) and escape the direct control of J.O. However, they continued with prostitution activities in other localities (e.g. Naples, Italy), given the coercive state the victims were held in and the constant threats, namely by phone.The interception of communications documented references to payments of thousands of Euro made by the victims to J.O. and the organised criminal group. It further clearly revealed the violent nature of threats (including dead threats) of J.O. against the victims and their families. In establishing the fact, authorities relied inter alia in the declarations of victims and surveillance techniques (including interception of communications). Legal Findings:Against this background, the Judge for Preliminary Investigations concluded for the existence of strong indicia on the suspects’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group and participation in an organised criminal group (understood as “associazione a delinquere”as defined in Italian law)dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings, in order to obtain a financial or other material benefit.The Judge for Preliminary Investigations acknowledged the underlying precautionary requirements: (i) risk of escape, enhanced by: (a) the defendants‘ declared intention to go abroad, especially to Nigeria, so as to camouflage traces, (b) the defendants’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group specialised inter alia in facilitating illegal movements across borders, undetected by authorities; (ii) risk of recidivism, for the active role of the suspects in an organised and well-established organised criminal group; (iii) risk of tempering with evidence, including by threatening migrants and or their families.Accordingly, the Judge for Preliminary Investigations confirmed the precautionary detention of the defendants.For details on the legal reasoning applied, see infra under “Commentary”. ---* Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"This order for precautionary detention relates to the activities of an organised criminal group (associazione a delinquere) dedicated inter alia to migrant smuggling and trafficking in human being for sexual exploitation. The organised criminal group operated in Nigeria, Maghreb countries (especially Libya) and Italy (Lampedusa, Agrigento, Palermo, Reggio Calabria, Napoli, Padova). The investigations unveiled the membership of the defendants in the organised criminal group and its activities. Investigations are on-going to identify other members of the associazione a delinquere.Specifically:Defendant J.O. (a.k.a. V.) holds a dominant position within the associazione a delinquere insofar as she manages the logistics of the transnational organised criminal group in Italy, collects the profits of prostitution activities, and takes the necessary measures to ensure the victims remain in a situation of dependence and submission to the interests of the criminal network. She, together with defendant O.G.A., carry out a series of intimidating, harming and threatening actions to punish the victims who leave the accommodation unauthorised or to force their return to the prostitution ring once they managed to escape its direct control.Defendant E.C., in close coordination with J.O., was in charge of arranging the transportation of the victims to Italy and making sure it follows as planned.In close coordination with J.O., defendant I.B. provided regular and important logistical support to the associazione a delinquere, namely by renting accommodation where the victims were settled and carried out prostitution activities as well as providing a range of SIM cards through which communication ensued and threats were made in order to keep the victims fearful, intimidated and, consequently, in a state of dependence and vulnerability. Three victims were identified. From their statements it emerged this case regards a situation that starts as a typical scenario of migrant smuggling (whereby the migrant contacts the smuggler or follow-up on his or her contact in order to arrange for the trip to another country, in the hope of improving life conditions) then progressively developing into trafficking in human beings.

It further clearly revealed the violent nature of threats (including dead threats) of J.O. against the victims and their families.At the time of the order of precautionary detention herein under analysis, the victims were still being harassed and threatened, namely via voodoo rituals, per orders and with funding of J.O., with the collaboration of I.B. and O.G.A.In establishing the fact, authorities relied inter alia in the declarations of victims and surveillance techniques (including interception of communications). Legal Findings:Against this background, the Public Prosecutor argued for the existence of strong indicia on the suspects’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation, in order to obtain a financial or other material benefit. The members of the organised criminal group would also be involved in related offences (e.g. inhuman and degrading treatment as per conditions the migrants were submitted to during the crossing of the Channel of Sicily and enforced prostitution). The Public Prosecutor highlighted the underlying precautionary requirements: (i) risk of escape, enhanced by the suspects‘ membership in a transnational organised criminal group whose main purpose is to facilitate the escape of individuals abroad; (ii) risk of recidivism, for the active role of the suspects in an extremely organised and well-established organised criminal group; (iii) risk of tempering with evidence, including by threatening migrants and or their families. For details on the legal reasoning applied, see infra under “Commentary”.--- * Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"On 18 March 2016, following rescue calls, the Italian Guard Coast intercepted in international waters a vessel* with 123 male African irregular migrants on board, one of whom was unconscious. The Italian Coast Guard boarded the migrants into their ships and left adrift the vessel in which the migrants had travelled. The migrants arrived to the Port of Pozzallo (Italy) on 19 March 2016. From investigations resulted that the migrants (mostly original from Central Africa), arrived to Libya following complicate trips from their home-countries. In Libya, they contacted individuals they knew to be intermediaries for a criminal network of Libyan men dedicated to organising the travel of irregular migrants into Italy, upon payment of the established fee. On the day off the trip, armed Libyan men conducted the migrants to a beach where the vessel that should lead them to Italy was anchored. The preparation of the vessel took several hours (from the night of 17 March 2016 to 5.00 a.m. of the following day). Migrants were made to board the vessel one by one, after which the person affected to steer the vessel boarded as well and took his place.Before departure, the Libyan men gave instructions to the defendant. After one hour navigating, the engine of the boat went off. The defendant took approximately one hour to repair it. Following several hours on the sea, the defendant called for rescue via a satellite phone, which he threw into the sea afterwards. Upon the arrival of authorities, the excited migrants struggled to reach the life jackets that were being thrown to them. In the chaos that followed, one migrant was stepped on and smashed. He later died.In Pozzallo, the migrants underwent the first procedures of identification and were interviewed. Several migrants identified the defendant as being the person steering the vessel.Questioned by the Criminal Police, the defendant admitted to the version of events described by the migrants. He added that once reaching Libya from Senegal, he was approach by a Gambian man connected to the smuggling network, who proposed to him to steer the vessel in exchange of him and a friend of his not paying the trip fee. The defendant admitted to have accepted the proposal. The Gambian then took him to the presence of Libyan men, who led him to a house where he was forced to remain with two other men. When he tried to leave the house, he was beaten up. In the following days, the Libyan men took him to the beach where they instructed the defendant on the procedures of the trip (e.g. rescue call, manoeuvring the vessel, with the indication that in case of no rescue he should return to Libya). However, in the questioning in presence of the Judge for Preliminary Investigations, the defendant changed his statement. Specifically he declared to have accepted to steer the vessel because he could not pay for the trip. Once on the beach, he would have been beaten up by the Libyan men, who would have thus coerced him to helm the vessel. In ascertaining the facts, authorities took into account the result of interception of communications, documental and testimonial evidence (all 123 migrants were heard). The Inter-force Police of Ragusa (Italy) further performed verification diligences. Legal findings:The Preliminary Investigations Judge of Ragusa considered the evidentiary material supported the probable responsibility of the defendant for the crime of migrant smuggling, aggravated by (i) having submitted the migrants to degrading and inhuman conditions, (ii) the censored activities having addressed more than five migrants, (iii) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit.  Accordingly, it determined – as precautionary measure - his remand in custody. The Judge for Preliminary Investigations did not find, at the time, sufficient indicia of the crime enshrined in Article 586 Criminal Code, that is death as a result of another crime.On appeal, the Court of Catania (Italy) confirmed the precautionary measure.For further details, see infra “Commentary”. ---* Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"Investigations unveiled the existence of an organised criminal group of Somali origin dedicated to the smuggling of migrants into countries of the North of Europe, via Italy. The organised criminal group is operative in Ragusa (Italy) with several contacts in other regions of Sicily and Naples (Italy) as well as North of Europe.The organised criminal group provided  - upon exorbitant payment (from 800 to 1200 Euro per person) – food and accommodation, false documents and tickets towards the aimed countries of destination. On 19 August 2013, O.M.S. (refugee) denounced the kidnapping of his brother who would have arrived in the Port of Pozzallo (Italy) in July 2013 and from who he had had no news since then. According to the complaint, his brother would be restrained in an apartment in Comiso (Italy). Two members of the said organised criminal group managed such apartment providing accommodation, upon the payment of 1000 Euro per person, to irregular migrants not yet identified and registered by Italian authorities. The same individuals facilitated migrants’ trip to other European countries, until the aimed final destination. O.M.S. declared to have visited the apartment, observed the presence of several irregular migrants living therein as well as to have been threatened and beaten up by those managing the accommodation. On 19 August 2013, authorities carried out a search to the said apartment. It led to the seizure of several satellite telephones and documents. Likewise, authorities found 12 irregular migrants in the apartment. All had abandoned the reception centre of Pozzallo shortly after arrival. Two of these migrants declared that, upon their arrival to Pozzallo, H. (who knew they wanted to proceed to Germany) contacted them proposing to facilitate their travel. They were removed to the searched apartment where they awaited false documents that would enable the continuation of their trip. The other migrants were in the same situation. The owner of the apartment confirmed to have rented the estate at the request of H. so that he (and his associates) could accommodate temporarily irregular migrants. He confirmed H. was part of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants in the terms and with the modus operandi described above. He further stated he should have received 30 Euro per person in the apartment. H. should transfer the money which had not happen given the intervention of police authorities. Through the interception of telecommunication of H., a number of his associates were identified, amongst whom the current appellant. Even though the latter was not organically inserted in the structures of the organised criminal group, he was a major contact point for Somali irregular migrants arrived in Sicily and whishing to proceed towards other European countries. The appellant operated in Sicily, mostly between Mineo and Pozzallo (Italy). He was particularly proactive in recruiting migrants recently arrived to the Ports of Pozzallo and Trapani (Italy), assisting them in avoiding the procedures of photo identification and registration by Italian authorities. The appellant would also have been involved in the arrangement of a fraudulent family reunification for which he requested 2000 Euro.  Legal findings:The Preliminary Investigations Judge of Catania (Italy) considered the evidentiary material supported the probable responsibility of the defendant for the crime of migrant smuggling, aggravated by (i) the censored activities having addressed more than five migrants, (ii) the intent of obtaining a material or other material benefit, (iii) the procurement of false documents.  Accordingly, it determined – as precautionary measure - his obligation of residence in the commune of domicile (i.e. Catania).On appeal, the Court of Catania confirmed the precautionary measure.For further details, see infra “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"On 8 February 2015, an individual (later identified as the suspect) using an Italian mobile phone informed the International Coordination Centre in Madrid (Spain) that several people (including his brother) were on board a ship in direction to Italy. In order to allow tracing the ship, the suspect communicated the number of the satellite phone on board. The information was passed to the International Coordination Centre in Pratica di Mare (Italy). At the same time, the International Coordination Centre in Rome (Italy) received similar information from an individual in Spain. The Italian Coast Guard managed to track the Thuraya satellite phone: the boat was located in Libyan waters. Several merchant ships changed their route in the attempt of assisting the migrants’ ship. The Italian Navy was also deployed. The migrants were finally found in two sinking dinghy boats. As per declarations of the survivors, it is estimated that 202 people lost their lives.Given the seriousness of the events, the Criminal Police immediately opened investigations. It proceeded to the reconstruction of the facts, took migrants’ declarations, launched phone interceptions (including re the satellite phone), and surveillance operations. The interceptions showed inter alia that during the days of the tragedy, the phone used by the suspect (registered under another name) had repeatedly been in contact with the satellite phone on board of the sank boats. The investigation showed the prominent role of the suspect in the migrants’ smuggling activities object of the proceedings. Such activities result from a criminal conspiracy dedicated to the smuggling of migrants, managed by an organised criminal group of transnational nature (operating at least in Libya and Italy). From the evidence resulted as follows:The suspect’s brother arrived to Libya on the first days of February 2015. He remained in the house of the smugglers. On 6 February, migrants set for Italy in four boats, three of which sank.The suspect had for several times carried out unambiguous actions aimed at procuring the illegal entry of his brothers from Libya into Italy. He communicated directly with the smugglers, addressing them by name. He also effectuated payments: 550 Euros per person.The suspect had been in contact with several intermediaries/smugglers in the attempt of tracing his brother (who was on board one of the dinghy boats and ended up perishing in the sea) and his other brother, still in Libya.The organised criminal group the suspect is part of established collection centres in Libya. Migrants were agglomerated there while awaiting departure to Italy and until they paid for the trip (1100-1200 USD).There are indicia indicating that the suspect, together with other associates, might be involved in procuring illegal entry of migrants by air. However, many of the contacts established in this respect were so via Viber. Thus, further investigation is necessary because access to data in relation to such communication platforms is difficult. The suspect might also be involved in facilitating the illegal stay of migrants, namely while awaiting departure to other countries of the EU (upon payment of 1100-1200 USD). The investigation further unveiled clear evidence of involvement of the suspect in drug trafficking. Legal Findings:Against this background, the Judge of Preliminary Investigations confirms the precautionary detention of the suspect, but highlights that: (i) further investigation is necessary, since though significant circumstantial evidence against the suspect is available, it is not overwhelming; (ii) the investigation shall clarify the specific role of the suspect, who does not appear to be an organiser.In its decision, the Judge notes the prevalent precautionary requirements: risk of flight and risk of recidivism.For further details see infra under “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,0
"On 19 October 2015, Italian authorities were informed of a vessel* carrying out app. 300 migrants, off the coast of Italy, southwest of Capo Passero  (Sicily, Italy). It had no flag or visible identifiers. On 20 October 2015, the Italian Navy rescued the said vessel in international waters. It was ascertained it had departed from Egypt. It had 478 migrants on board, who had paid for the trip. Many had come from different African countries, where they dealt with intermediaries. Contacts sometimes ensued via Facebook. Migrants converged to Egypt, where they were “gathered” by the smugglers, while waiting for the travel. A relatively new modus operandiof smugglers was unveiled.Since the beginning of the trip, the vessel later rescued (first vessel) was always accompanied by another vessel (second vessel), with its own crew. At a certain point, it gained some distance from the migrants’ vessel (first vessel). A migrant woman who spoke English was instructed to call Italian authorities and ask for help, which she did. After the rescue operation by the Italian Navy, and the consequent abandonment of the first vessel, the second vessel retrieved the first vessel and towed it in direction of Egypt. Defendants #1 to #7 were identified as the crew of the first vessel (having thus been detained on 20 October 2015). On 21 October 2015, the Italian Navy detained defendants #8 to #21 (crew of the second vessel) in the course of an inspection in international waters. Aware of this modus operadi, Italian authorities had affected a unit to verify the existence and location of the second vessel. It also displayed no flag or identifiersIn the determination of facts, investigative authorities resorted to (i) declarations of migrants, (ii) photo identification of the defendants by migrants, (iii) records of the rescue operations, (iv) records of inspection to the second vessel. Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor considered the crew of both the first and second vessels (all defendants) were responsible for procuring illegal entry of migrants into Italy but also for participating in an organised criminal group (associazione a delinquere) aimed at facilitating irregular migration. It issued the corresponding orders of precautionary detention. However, the Judge for Preliminary Investigations of Catania confirmed the measure only in respect of defendants #8 to #21, in respect of migrant smuggling. It rejected the measure as far as the participation in an organised criminal group – understood as associazione a delinquere as defined in Italian law - was concerned and with regard to all defendants. The Public Prosecutor appealed of this decision. The Court of Catania upheld the appeal and ordered the precautionary detention of all defendants for both facilitation of irregular migration and participation in an organised criminal group (associazione a delinquere).  It acknowledged the precautionary requirements of (i) risk of escape, (ii) risk of recidivism, and (iii) risk of tampering with evidence.

"The case against the defendant results from a broader investigation into the activities of an organised criminal group – mostly composed of Eritrean nationals – operating in Italy and with tight connections abroad. The main scope of the organised criminal group is the smuggling of migrants (Eritrean, in their majority) into Italy and other E.U. country, with the purpose of obtaining a profit therewith (usually, between 120 and 200 Euro per person). The defendant organised and arranged the clandestine trip of irregular migrants arrived in Italy to countries of Central and Northern European, often by bus as it would not imply any document control. To this end, he was in contact with other identified and non-identified intermediaries of the organised criminal group. The main scope of the defendant’s activities was to remove migrants from reception centres before their photo identification and registration in the Eurodac system, thus enabling the presentation of asylum claims in other countries rather than Italy (country of irregular entry) as per the so-called Dublin II System. The defendant also accommodated irregular migrants awaiting their travel to the desired final countries of destination.The defendant admitted to the logistical assistance provided to irregular migrants but denied to have had any lucrative purpose. In ascertaining the facts, authorities took into account the result of interception of communications, documental and testimonial evidence. Authorities further performed verification diligences. Legal findings:The Preliminary Investigations Judge of Catania (Italy) deemed there were no significant indicia of participation in an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants (associazione a delinquere). To the contrary it considered the evidentiary material supported the probable responsibility of the defendant for the crime of migrant smuggling. Accordingly, it determined – as precautionary measure -  the defendant’s obligation to present himself before the Criminal Police every day of the week.On appeal, the Court of Catania confirmed the precautionary measure.For further details, see infra “Commentary”,",smuggling of migrants,1
"On 27 August 2015, the Vessel ‘Poseidon’ (Swedish Coast Guard) arrived to the port of Palermo (Italy) having on board app. 600 migrants. Amongst these, 494 had been transported from Libya to Italy on a 20 meters long boat, deprived of adequate navigability conditions, security systems and clearly overloaded. Around 100 persons were forced to remain throughout the whole trip in the hold of the ship (maximum 150 cm high and four meters wide, with no adequate and available air entries). Importantly, the boat was navigating with the engines on, which were located in the hold. Thus, the migrants therein installed were forced to inhale smokes and gases. These conditions – together with the fact that the crew prevented migrants from coming outside to breath – led to the death of 52 persons by asphyxiation.From the statement of the migrants, photo identification of the suspects, Frontex records, and the verifications carried out by the Criminal Police, it further results as follow:In Libya, the migrants paid app. 1000-1500 Libyan Dinars or 1000 USD for the trip to Italy. After payment, hey stayed in a house guarded by armed men who prevented them from leaving. After app. 20 days in this situation, the migrants were transported to the seaside in small trucks. There, in groups of 20-25, they embarked into small boats. After few hours of navigation, they transferred to a larger ship, in which they attempted to cross the Channel of Sicily.The boat left Libya on 26 August 2015. It was in extremely precarious conditions.Some people were selected, on the basis of racial criteria, to travel in the hold of the ship.The crew (i.e. smugglers) had specific and well-defined roles. B.M. and Z.B. were in charge of driving the boat. The other suspects were responsible for maintaining the order during the trip, notably by preventing those in the hold from coming outside and aggressing them (with bats and knifes) when they tried to do so.The migrants repeatedly informed the crew of the life threatening situation in the hold and, later, of the death of some of them. The crew had no reaction to this information.When recovered in the context of the Search and Rescue (SAR) operation, the bodies already showed signs of rigor mortis. Legal findings:The Preliminary Investigations Judge considered that strong indicia existed of the affiliation of the suspects to an organised criminal group, with transnational character, dedicated to the smuggling of migrants with the purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit. He therefore confirmed their precautionary detention. In so doing, the Judge stressed the precautionary needs: risk of escape, risk of recidivism, and risk of tempering with evidence. These threats were reinforced by the suspect’s involvement in a resourceful and structured organised criminal group (i) dedicated precisely to facilitating illegal movements across countries, (ii) deeply emerged in criminal activities, and (iii) with no reservations in menacing the life and safety of others.

"Investigations disclosed that the appellant occupied a prominent role in a robust organised criminal group dedicated, in a systematic and reiterated manner, to the smuggling of migrants into Italy, with the purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit. The organised criminal group recruited migrants from several African countries and assembled them in Libya. They departed from Tripoli (Libya) by vessel* in direction to the Italian shore. Most of the members of the organised criminal group were Eritrean. The appellant was in charge of assisting the transit of migrants from their points of arrival in the South of Italy to Milan (North of Italy) and countries of Central and Northern Europe. He instructed migrants on the behaviour to adopt in order to elude authorities. He also perceived the payment regarding to his activities of facilitation/assistance.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on testimonial evidence and interception of communications. Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor accused the defendant of migrant smuggling and ordered his precautionary detention. The Judge for Preliminary Investigations confirmed the precautionary detention. In review, the Court of Catania (Italy) confirmed the decision of the Judge for Preliminary Investigations and the defendant appealed. The Court of Cassation upheld the appealed decision. For further details, see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”. --- * Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"On 15 April 2015, an Italian military tugboat arrived to the port of Catania (Italy) with 276 irregular migrants on board. The latter had been rescued off the coast of Libya on 13 April 2015, following a Search and Rescue (SAR) alert. The migrants were travelling in a wooden fishing boat, overloaded, and in precarious conditions. From the (i) records of the SAR operation, (ii) statements of the rescuing tugboat officials, (iii) verifications carried out by the Criminal Police, (iv)  statement of some amongst the migrants, who were heard as suspects in the contravenzzione of illegal immigration,  and (v) photo identification made by the latter, the following was asserted:The migrants were mostly original from the Middle East and Central Africa. Once in Libya, they contacted Libyan intermediaries and smugglers, who connected them with the organised criminal group managing smuggling ventures to Italy. The migrants were then transferred to different houses in Tripoli (Libya).Migrants paid between 4500 and 5000 USD per adult and 1200 Libyan Dinars per child.As departure approached, migrants were directed to a beach close to Sabratah (Libya), where they remained hidden under a marquee. At some point, there was a dispute between two self-proclaimed “bosses”. One of them, avowing himself the “absolute leader”, requires from the other the payment of a pecuniary sum in order to allow the transit of the migrants. The suspect is accompanied of seven men in civilian tenure and one-armed man in military uniform.With several inflatables, the migrants were led in groups of 30 to the fishing boat that would bring them to Italy. In the fishing boat were four Libyan men and another one, who was identified by the migrants as the coxswain. Through photo identification by the interviewed migrants, the coxswain was recognised as the suspect in the proceedings.After approximately 12 hours of navigation, using a Thuraya telephone, the suspect calls a woman, who initially suggests that he turns back as rescuing vessels are taken in other operations. However, the trip continues because migrants refuse to go back. The migrants are finally assisted by an Icelandic merchant vessel and rescued by the Italian tugboat Asso 21, in international waters, and directed to Italy.During rescue, the fishing boat and the tugboat are approached by a speedboat masting the Libyan flag with the writing “Libyan Navy”. The speedboat had on board four men, two of whom armed with Kalashnikov and apparently dressed in military tenure. Some shots were fired into the air to speed up the disembarkment of the migrants, after which the four men led the fishing boat towards the coast of Libya. Legal findings:The Court of Catania concluded for the participation of the suspect in the activities of the transnational organised criminal group, which operated with the purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit. The Court considered there to be aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) the number of migrants transported (much higher than five), and (iii) the risk to the life and safety of migrants, made to travel in an inadequate and deteriorated ship.Against this background, the Court confirmed the remand in custody of the accused, ruling that, were him to be released, there would be (a) risk of recidivism, (b) risk of escape.For further details, see infra “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The current proceedings emerged as the follow-up of the work developed and findings reached in the so-called Glauco Operation (Case n. 10341/15 R.N. G.I.P.- SHERLOC Case Law Database ID ITAh013), carried out by the same Public Prosecutor Office. The organized criminal group therein identified remains fully operative at a transnational level. It holds cells in places/locations of reference. Its members are attributed specific roles in order to allow the smooth accomplishment of the criminal plan: first, illegal entry of migrants in Italy; second, their transit to final destinations – usually in the North of EU – where migrants join their families or close friends. Migrants pay high prices for the “services” of the criminal network.The investigation was much based on phone tapping and surveillance operations.  The declarations of migrants (including in the context of other proceedings) were also very important. The Criminal Police and Public Prosecutor heard several migrants. Migrants’ photo-identification of the suspects was used as evidence. The Criminal Police carried out verification diligences (including searches) in order to confirm information available through the different sources. As a result, and in addition to the above, the following chain of events and methodology was ascertained:The typical modus operandiof the organised criminal group lies on certain main features. Notably: (i) migrants are illegally introduced in Italy; (ii) migrants are strongly advised to avoid the standard identification procedures, including photographs; (iii) before the conclusion of identification and reception procedures, migrants are assisted in moving towards the North of Italy and, from there, to the North of the E.U., thus precluding the application of national and EU laws on immigration. This major effort to avoid the control of authorities upon arrival relates to the fact that – according to EU law - the administrative procedure aimed at obtaining a residence permit and or refugee status shall be finalised where it is initiated. If migrants are photo identified in Italy, the mentioned administrative procedure is triggered, while migrants usually wish to settle in Nordic countries, either because of more advantageous social benefits therein in place or to join relatives or friends.The smuggling ventures towards Italy are organised in different stages. Migrants are firstly collected and assembled in Libya. G.E. (high rank within the organised criminal group) and his associates receive the migrants that – in some instances – have travelled for months in order to reach Libya. They are kept usually in Zuwhara (Libya), where G.A. has control over houses in which he can accommodate the migrants until the day of departure. Migrants are usually monitored under the threat of weapons.Migrants following the so-called terrestrial route (from several African countries towards Libya) are submitted to aggravated violence (including kidnapping) during the trip, of which G.E. and his associates are aware and accomplices. Migrants must pay smugglers for this trip, and are sometimes held and forced to work as a form of payment. G.E. attributes a number to each ‘client’ in order to better organise the work of the organised criminal group as well as to manage those that have already paid. These records unveils that the organised criminal group manages hundreds of millions of USD just in respect of ‘African smuggling’. To such values must be added the amounts paid in the EU.The migrants are then embarked into all the more precarious boats, usually in direction to Italy. Relying on the Operation Mare Nostrum, smugglers abandon these boats – often in very precarious conditions – in international waters, after launching a request for help to authorities. This part of the smuggling venture (i.e., by sea) is also subject to payment.Once in Italian soil, migrants are again ‘recruited’ by members of the organized criminal group operating in Italy, with the promise of facilitating their further movements, always upon payment. Migrants are demanded different amounts: first, to reach Rome (Italy) or Milan (Italy); second, to go from there to their final destination (Switzerland, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Norway). The trip to Rome or Milan usually occurs by public bus or private vehicles (driven by members or associates of the organized criminal group). The bus is currently a popular and preferred means for smugglers insofar as there is no need to exhibit an identification document in order to buy the ticket or travel. Furthermore, buses are often not subject to search and control operations by authorities (as, e.g., trains and private vehicles). The ‘prices’ vary. Usually migrants are requested 200-400 Euro for one or two days of accommodation in Sicily (Italy) plus the ticket to the North of Italy. Then, they have to pay 1000-2000 Euro to continue the trip towards their final destination. The real ‘price’ will, however, vary according to the economic power of the migrant, which will also determine the ‘quality’ and extent of the ‘services’ provided by the organized criminal group (e.g., for the proper ‘price’, the migrant may be accompanied and accommodated until the final destination).To this effect, the ”agreement” with the migrant to continue relying on the organized criminal group after entry in Italy is crucial. Sometimes, the “agreement” is reached by telephone. The organized criminal group assists the migrant in escaping the reception centre/structure and provides the necessary logistical support (e.g., accommodation) until the trip to the North of Italy. Different methodologies are used to ‘attract clients’: (i) collaboration of migrants living in the reception centres/structures; (ii) contacts through relatives, whereby the later contact the smugglers and these ask for the phone number of the potential ‘client’ in order to formalise details; (iii) direct engagement, whereby smugglers go to the points of entry of migrants and carefully ‘advert’ the available services. Again, all services are dependent on payment.Payments are usually done in advance, without which no ‘service’ will be made available by the organized criminal group. Payments take place through different systems, legal and otherwise: (i) directly in cash; (ii) ‘Hawala’ banking system (based on trust, this modality of payment requires neither the movement of cash by the sender and receiver nor formal registration, thus escaping the scrutiny of authorities and anti-laundry regulations); (iii) through financial services providers that allow a quick and smooth movement of cash, such as Western Union, MoneyGram, and, in Italy, Postpay.The organized criminal group also procures false documents so as to allow migrants to continue their travelling abroad undetected by authorities. There is likewise reference to sham marriages as a means of procuring and or enabling illegal entry, transit and stay.G.E., M.M.Y. (in North Africa) and G.A. (in Italy) are at this stage identified as the main leaders of the organized criminal group, directing operations and or men. However, evidence was gathered showing the essential contribution of all suspects to the smuggling of migrants and related offences carried out by the organized criminal group. They had precise yet varied roles within the organized criminal group, e.g. migrants’ receiver and or collector, driver, hawalar.The investigation individualized several specific episodes/businesses, mostly in relation to the disembarkment of hundreds of migrants in 2014 and 2015 in Sicily. The organised criminal group remains operative. Investigations are on-going with the purpose of identifying the remaining members and associates. The organised criminal group is responsible for smuggling tens of thousands of migrants, in often-inhuman conditions. Legal Findings:The Public Prosecutor argued for the existence of strong evidence on the suspects’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants, in order to obtain a financial or other material benefit.  This organised criminal group operates mostly in Central Africa (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan), Maghreb countries (especially Libya), Italy and the North of Europe (Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Germany). The members of the organised criminal group would also be involved in related offences (e.g. inhuman and degrading treatment as per conditions the migrants were submitted to during the crossing of the Channel of Sicily, and crimes against the public order as per production and procurement of false documents). The Public Prosecutor concluded for the existence of evidence upholding the individual responsibility of all suspects for (i) criminal conspiracy dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and (ii) procuring and or enabling the illegal entry, transit and stay of migrants into Italy (and from there to other EU countries). He stressed the existence of aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) that more than five people were smuggled, (iii) that more than 3 people were engaged in the criminal act, (iv) the danger to the life and safety of migrants, (iv) the inhuman treatment migrants were subjected to, (v) transnational character of the organised criminal group, and (vi) the use of weapons in public. The Public Prosecutor finally highlighted the underlying precautionary requirements: (i) risk of escape, enhanced by the suspects‘ membership in a transnational organised criminal group; (ii) risk of recidivism, for the active role of the suspects in an extremely organised and well-established organised criminal group as well as the expected amelioration on seas and weather condition, which are likely to prompt additional smuggling ventures; (iii) risk of tempering with evidence, including by threatening migrants and or their families. Against this background, the Public Prosecutor determined the precautionary detention of the suspects.

"On 19 July 2014, 2100 migrants arrived to the Port of Salerno (Italy). They had been adrift in different vessels* when they were rescued by a ship of the Italian Navy. The Public Prosecutor accused three individuals of smuggling of migrants. The irregular migrants who identified the defendants as smugglers had not been interrogated with the assistance of legal counsel even though they (the migrants) were being investigated for the related offence of illegal entry and stay in the national territory (Article 10 bis Decree Law 286/1998). Defendant A.A. was heard with the assistance of legal counsel. He admitted to have accepted the task of mastering the vessel but his declarations were not preceded of the warnings enshrined in Article 64 (3) Code of Criminal Procedure, including (i) his or her declarations might be used against him or her, (ii) right not to answer to certain questions in the terms determined by law. The other defendants denied criminal responsibility. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence. Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor accused the defendants of migrant smuggling and ordered their precautionary detention. The Judge for Preliminary Investigations denied the precautionary detention of the defendants given that the declarations of the migrants (that identified the defendants as smugglers) had to be declared null given that they had not been heard with the assistance of legal counsel. The Public Prosecutor appealed. The Court of Cassation denied the appeal and upheld the appealed decision.For further details, see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”. --- * Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"On 10 September 2013, a ship of the Romanian Navy informed Italian authorities of a vessel* in international waters which appeared to intend to transfer a high number of people into a smaller vessel it had been towing. Shortly after, both vessels were progressing side by side. After the transfer, the small vessel took the direction of Siracusa (Italy) while the larger one (mother-vessel) headed back. On 12 September 2013, 199 migrants were rescued from the smaller vessel by a ship of the Italian Guardia di Finanza. They were taken to Siracusa.Meanwhile the Romanian ship had halted the mother-vessel, which exhibited no flag. It inspected the members of the crew, who presented 15 documents written in Arabic. All declared to be fishermen. A ship of the Italian Guardia di Finanzia joined the Romanian authorities and seized the mother-vessel.Migrants declared to have initiated the smuggling venture in small vessels, which transported them to the mother-vessel. It was in this latter vessel that the majority of the trip occurred.From investigations it emerged that the facts described integrated the systematic practice of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants into Italy, with the purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit. The organised criminal group acted on the basis of the mother-vessel/small-vessel modus operandi, whereby the former (more robust and in better navigability conditions) remains in international waters with the purpose of avoiding the reach of States’ jurisdiction. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, interception of communications, and photo identification. Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor accused the defendants of migrant smuggling and ordered their precautionary detention. The Judge for Preliminary Investigations confirmed the precautionary detention. In review, the Court of Catania (Italy) confirmed the decision of the Judge for Preliminary Investigations and the defendant appealed. The Court of Cassation upheld the appealed decision. For further details, see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”. uuu * Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"On 13 February 2015, following a Search and Rescue (SAR) alert, the Italian Navy vessel Spica rescued 276 migrants in international waters. The merchant ship MSC Belle had previously recovered them from three drifting boats in precarious conditions. Due to the turbulent sea, the migrants arrived in Lampedusa (Italy) only the day after. The Court of Catania – in the proceedings under analysis herein - dealt with the events related to one of those dinghy boats, from where 104 migrants were rescued. As a result of the (i) records of the SAR operation, (ii) statements of the crew of the Navy ship Spica, (iii) verifications carried out by the Criminal Police, (iv)  statements of migrants,  (v) photo identification of the suspect, (vi) confession of the suspect, and (vii) circumstantial evidence, the following was asserted:The migrants were mostly original from Central Africa, in particular Gambia, Chad, Ivory Coast, Senegal and Nigeria. Once in Libya, and after few months in jail, they contacted their countrymen acting as mediators. The latter connected them with the organised criminal group managing illegal trips to Italy in exchange of app. 2000 USD. The migrants were then transferred to a shed on the seaside near Tripoli (Italy), where they remained with several other individuals for periods ranging from few days to some months.During such periods, the migrants remained under tight surveillance of Libyan armed men. The weapons would be used against migrants in case of disobedience. Migrants were prevented from leaving or moving freely. They were very poorly fed.On 12 February 2015, the migrants were transported in a big lorry to the beach where they were made to board a rubber dinghy. A man (recognised as the suspect) - that had never been in the shed with the migrants - took over the helm and mastered the boat throughout the whole trip, showing his expertise even when the sea was turbulent.The suspect admitted to his role in the criminal plan: being a fisherman, he made himself available to the Libyan organisers of the trip to master the boat in exchange for not paying the demanded travel fee. The Libyan organisers had provided him with a campus and Thuraya satellite phone. After eight hours of navigation, the suspect called the Libyan base with the Turaya phone, who then alerted the authorities.The migrants had been warned in advance that at a certain stage, the Italian authorities would be called to their rescue, which would effectively lead to their entry into the State. Legal findings:The Court of Catania concluded for the existence of strong indicia of the suspect’s criminal responsibility in procuring the illegal entry of migrants in Italy as well as participating in the activities of the Libyan organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants.The Court considered there to be aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) the number of migrants transported (much higher than five), and (iii) the risk to the life and safety of migrants, made to travel in an inadequate and deteriorated ship, overcrowded and with no safety equipment.Against this background, the Court confirmed the remand in custody of the accused, considering that, were him to be released, there would be (a) risk of recidivism, (b) risk of escape. Yet, the Court acknowledged the prompt collaboration of the suspect with authorities, which could be relevant in determining the penalty in case of conviction.For further details, see infra “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"In spite of the international public opinion outcry following the tragic shipwreck of 3 April 2013 that happened between the Libyan and Italian coast, causing the deaths of 366 people, the migratory flux did not stop. Among others, on 25/10/2015 the Italian coastal authority registered the arrival on the Italian territory (namely the island of Lampedusa, Sicily) of the accused. Once at the reception centre he was assaulted by a group of shipwreck victims requiring the intervention of the Italian Police to block their attempt to lynch him. During the first investigations the facts surrounding the case at issue emerged.According to the consistent statements rendered by the 7 witnesses, the journey of circa 130 people started in Eritrea, transiting to Ethiopia, Sudan and then Chad (across the desert) to reach Libya and finally, via sea, to Europe (Italy, Lampedusa). The witnesses explained that the journey involved quarantine in an area of the border between Sudan and Chad and in Tripoli, Libya where each migrant had to provide a ransom fee (between 1.000,00-4.000,00 USD) in order to proceed to the next destination. Besides the degrading conditions of the places they were quarantined and of the transfer means (overcrowding leading to death or shipwreck), witnesses also reported cases of torture (i.e. bodies scattered with gasoline so as to cause severe skin pain due to its abrasive nature; people forced to put their feet on wet floors and then electric shocks being delivered; sexual assaults; physical assaults with and without firearms, psychological menace; …), deprivation of personal liberty (oppression), inhuman treatment, extortion and sexual abuse all perpetrated by the defendant.",smuggling of migrants,1
"On 3 October 2013, a boat with migrants in provenance from Libya and directed to Sicily (Italy), capsized and killed 366 people. Only 156 people survived. The migrants were all Eritrean, with the exception of one Tunisian. The boat was clearly overloaded vis-à-vis its conditions of navigability. The survivors were sent to the reception centre of Lampedusa (Italy).On 25 October 2013, a group of migrants who had also been rescued off the coast of Italy was sent to the same reception centre. One of the new arrivals (the accused)  was aggressed by around 15 of the migrants already settled at the centre, amongst whom there were women in state of shock. The situation was controlled due to the intervention of the authorities.At least eight migrants were heard within the institute of incidente probatorio, in the presence of legal counsel and interpreters as they were heard as suspects in the contravvenzioneof illegal immigration. It resulted as follows:Some of the migrants started their trip in Eritrea, following to Ethiopia, Sudan, and Chad. They were then taken under the threat of weapons to the Sahara desert where they were prevented from leaving. The accused was the manager of the household (holding the keys of it). He carried out acts of sexual violence of the women. The same behaviour was manifested by associates of the accused. One of the women harassed and taken away did never return. Her whereabouts remained unknown.The organised criminal group requested 3300 USD to release the migrants. Those monitoring the household were armed.Once paid the ransom (usually by family members) the migrants were directed to Libya (often Tripoli) where they were delivered to another associate, who then demanded 1600 euro for the trip to Lampedusa.After approximately one month, the migrants were transported to a large boat off the coast of Libya, in which they travelled to Lampedusa and sank on 3 October 2013.Some migrants recognised the accused, once he arrived in the reception centre on 25 October.The accused was also heard, denying all the accusations and sustaining to be a smuggled migrant at the resemblance of all the others. Legal findings:The Court concludes that the accused: (i) was member of a highly structured and transnational organised criminal group based in Africa, acting with the purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, and dedicated to the smuggling of migrants (amongst other crimes), (ii) directly managed an illegal detention centre in the desert of Sahara, where (together with other non-identified Somali individuals) submitted the migrants to major violence, including sexual and gender-based violence against the women, (iii) organised, together with his associates, the remaining of the trip of the migrants, notably to Tripoli.The Court further considered there to be aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) more than five people were smuggled, (iii) more than 3 people were engaged in the criminal act, (iv) the life and safety of migrants was endangered. The Court refused the application of attenuating circumstances as it saw no sign of regret nor evidence contradicting its understanding of the events. Against this background, the Court convicted the accused of criminal conspiracy for the purpose of smuggling migrants as well as procuring the illegal entry of migrants in Italy. For further details, see infra under “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"On 30 August 2013, the Air Coastal Guard detected a ship off the coat of Sicily (Italy), presumably transporting irregular migrants, and towing a smaller boat. In time, the two ships separated, with the smaller navigating towards Italy and the larger one in the opposite direction. On the morning of 31 August, la Guardia di Finanza intercepted the smaller boat, having on board 110 foreigners, all men, all Egyptians, except for one Syrian. At least five migrants were heard by the criminal police, as suspects in the contravvenzione of irregular immigration. It resulted that migrants paid between 3000 and 3500 Euro for the trip. They were taken by bus to Alessandria (Egypt) where they stayed in a house in the countryside. After some days, they were transferred to the seaside, wherefrom, in small groups, they boarded inflatables. Following a one day trip, they again transferred to a large boat that towed a smaller one. After 24 hours of navigation, the migrants were passed to this latter ship, where there were four crew men. It was there that the migrants were rescued from by Italian authorities. The larger boat left towards Egypt. During the travel, the smugglers deprived the migrants of their money, mobile phones, and other possessions, mis-treated and threatened them. From the statement of the migrants as well as another accused resulted that:the defendant had held a position of control in the smaller boat, giving instructions, making sure order was maintained, and driving it;the actual leader was on board of the larger vessel that travelled back to Egypt;both the defendant and his partners (minors) had taken such positions in exchange for not paying their “tickets” (app. 2500 Euro). Legal findings:The Court concluded for the responsibility of the defendant in procuring illegal entry into Italy through a transnational organised criminal group. The Court considered there to be aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) more than five people were smuggled, (iii) more than 3 people were engaged in the criminal act, (iv) the life and safety of migrants was endangered. The Court also refused the application of attenuating circumstances as it saw no sign of regret nor evidence contradicting its understanding of the events. Against this background, the Court convicted the defendant for procuring illegal entry into Italy through an organised criminal group. However, it absolved him of the offence of criminal conspiracy, as it could not conclude for the existence of the necessary intrinsic associative bondage rather than an occasional, non-indispensable participation in a criminal act of the organised criminal group.The accused was thus convicted of aggravated procurement of illegal entry.For further details see infra under “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The defendant helmed a vessel that transported 234 migrants into Italy. The vessel sank, causing the death of 17 irregular migrants. According to the accusation, the defendant would have deliberately tampered with the engine in order to justify the rescue operation by Italian authorities. Upon being interrogated, the defendant admitted not to be experienced in mastering a vessel and that it was the first time he had actually done so.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on testimonial evidence. Legal findings:The Judge for Preliminary Investigations of Catania (Italy) confirmed the precautionary detention of the appellant considering the indicia of (i) causing the wrecking of a vessel, (ii) voluntary homicide (multiple counts), (iii) migrant smuggling. In review, the Court of Catania confirmed the decision of the Judge for Preliminary Investigations regarding migrant smuggling, annulled it in respect of the crime of “causing the wrecking of a vessel” and requalified “voluntary homicide” into “death or harm resulting from other crime” (Article 586 Criminal Code). Following the appeal of the Public Prosecutor, the Court of Cassation annulled the appealed decision regarding the crime of “causing the wrecking of a vessel” and confirmed it otherwise. For further details, see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”. --- * Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"On 14 October 2014, aerial and maritime units of the Italian Navy traced a merchant ship of considerable dimensions in international waters. This ship showed no flag nor did it evidence any identifiers. The ship was located East of the coat of Sicily and apparently in direction thereto. In view of these suspicious elements, the Italian vessel exercises its right of visit under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and national law. As a result, 323 migrants in provenance from several Asian and African countries, in particular Syria, were rescued and arrived in Catania on 16 October 2016. In asserting the facts of the case, the following means of evidence were taken into account: (i) records of seizure of the ship transporting the migrants, (ii) acts of investigation regarding the flag of such ship and verification carried out by the Navy, (iii)    statement by some of the migrants,  (iv) photo identification made by the latter, (v) confession of the suspect, and (vi) circumstantial evidence. Importantly, international cooperation played a crucial role. Indeed, by cross-checking the information gathered by the Italian Navy with that available to the Turkish Coastal Guard, it was determined:The ship transporting the smuggled migrants first departed from Istanbul (Turkey) on 18 September 2014, under the name TISS (as per A.I.S. – Automatic Identification System), with six crew men, and directed to Beirut (Lebanon).On 30 September 2014, with the new name of UFC-5, it stops in Northern Cyprus for several hours to then retake its journey towards Beirut. However, the ship takes a completely different route towards Alessandria (Egypt).It stops there for several hours to then again leave, under the name of TISS, towards Sicily (Italy) .In international waters, the ship was intercepted by the Italian Navy vessel Spica, which monitored it until it realised its precarious and overcrowded condition.On 15 October, a radio emergency call is placed, whereby it is mentioned the presence of app. 300 people on board, absence of captain and crew, malfunction of the engine and consequent need of rescue.The investigation made it reasonable to conclude that during the period of mid-September to mid-October, the merchant ship was taking onboard irregular migrants from different countries with the purpose of procuring their illegal entry in Italy. For instance, the first “package” of app. 100 migrants was called “Group 1” by the organisers. This group was transported in minivan and then via inflatables to the merchant ship off shore the city of Mersin (Libya), after a trip of app 6 hours. The migrants were threatened by the organisers were they not to hold their eyes down. Once on the merchant boat, the migrants were hidden under a marquee. It was further concluded:Some of the migrants, after irregularly reaching Turkey, contacted Syrian intermediaries (several) to whom they paid app. 6000-6500 USD.When transported to the merchant ship, the crew seized the mobile phones of the migrants. However, some managed to hide them, which allowed the migrants to follow the itinerary of the trip (as supra detailed). In each stop, new large groups of migrants boarded. Some members rebelled since they started doubting they would ever arrive to Italy. In those cases, they were kept under control by armed men (Egyptian).The migrants are made aware that if there were to be any malfunction with the ship, they should call the Red Cross, of which they had the contact (the mobile phones had been returned once leaving Egypt).The crewmembers were six Syrian and a Somali. The crewmembers never mingled with the migrants except when the ship was monitored by a helicopter.The suspect was identified by migrants as the captain of the ship.  Legal findings:Against this background, the Court of Catania concluded for the existence of strong indicia of the suspect’s responsibility in procuring the illegal entry of migrants in Italy as well as taking part in a criminal conspiracy to promote the smuggling of migrants. The Court considered there to be aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) the number of migrants transported (much higher than five), (iii) the number of perpetrators (more than three) and (iv) the risk to the life and safety of migrants, made to travel in an inadequate and deteriorated ship, overcrowded and with no safety equipment, (iv) transnational character of the operations of the organised criminal group. Thus, the Court confirmed the remand in custody of the accused, considering that, were him to be released, there would be (a) risk of recidivism, (b) risk of escape, (c) risk of tempering with evidence. For further details see infra under “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"This order for precautionary detention derives from a complex investigation that followed the tragic events of 3 October 2013. Specifically, a boat with migrants in provenance from Libya (and directed to Sicily, Italy) capsized, resulting in the death of at least 366 people. As per migrant’s reports, there would have been as many as 500 people in the boat. The migrants were mostly from Eritrea. The ship was clearly overloaded vis-à-vis its conditions of navigability. The survivors were sent to the reception centre of Lampedusa (Italy).Several migrants were heard preliminarily upon their arrival to Lampedusa by the State police and, later on, by the Criminal Police and Public Prosecutor. Migrants were likewise required to proceed to photo identification of the suspects. Phone tapping and surveillance operations also took place. In addition to the above, the following chain of events was ascertained:Migrants were contacted  by (or themselves contacted) the suspect G.E., with the purpose that the latter procured their illegal entry by sea into Italy.On 25 October 2013, a group of migrants - who had also been rescued off the coast of Italy - was directed to the reception centre of Lampedusa. One of the new arrivals (M.E.M., Somali, subject to separate criminal proceedings) was aggressed by app. 15 of the migrants already settled at the centre. The situation appeared to escalate into a lynching attempt but was controlled by the prompt intervention of authorities. M.E.M. was identified as the leader of an armed group – likely composed of Somali militiamen – responsible for the kidnapping of several migrants in July 2013, in the Sahara desert, when they were in course of the journey from their home countries to Libya. Migrants were taken under the threat of weapons to a house in Sheba (Libya) where they were prevented from leaving. The group of armed men carried out several acts of aggravated violence towards the migrants. The organised criminal group requested 3300 USD to release the migrants. Relatives of the migrants paid the ransom to M.E.M.’s associates, or via Money Transfer through codes supplied by the kidnappers.The migrants were then directed in groups of app. 20-30 people to other locations, often Tripoli (Libya), where they were delivered to the suspect G.E.. In the trip from Sheba to Tripoli, migrants changed several times means of transportation. G.E. had organised in Libya a “collection camp” where up to 600 persons were held and to whom 1600 euro per person were demanded for the trip to Lampedusa.After approximately one month, the migrants were transported to a large boat off the coast of Libya, in which they travelled to Lampedusa and that sank on 3 October 2013.The suspect M.J. was identified as a high leader of this organised criminal group. Direct evidence is available on his and G.E. involvement in the preparation and organisation, with a profitable purpose, of several trips (including, and similar to, the one culminating in the tragedy of 3 October 2013), dating as early as 2006/2007. Both suspects were also in the position of instructing others, collecting and disseminating information related to the criminal activities.The participation of all suspects in organising, procuring and enabling the illegal entry, transit and or stay of migrants in Italy, for profitable purposes, was further determined in respect of a number of specific episodes/criminal acts. In this context, some of the suspects (together with individuals not yet identified) inter alia organised and or assisted the escape of migrants from the reception centres, provided logistical support (tickets, clothing, temporary accommodation) and arranged their travel to the North of Italy and or other European countries. The suspects operating in Italy to enable the illegal transit and stay of irregular migrants were paid via: (i) Western Union, (ii) direct cash delivery by relatives of migrants, (iii) post payment systems.In respect of activities aimed at procuring the illegal entry in other EU countries, circumstantial evidence points to the purchase of several plane tickets, notably with low-cost companies such as Ryanair and Easyjet. Other times, the travel would be arranged via private transportation through the suspects’ associates. Furthermore, it was asserted that the organised criminal group procured and or produced false passports as well as engaged in the practice of supplying valid passports (after being tempered, namely by changing the picture) belonging to a third party so as to allow trips out with Italy. The migrants were then required to send back the passport to the involved suspects.The organised criminal group in order to procure illegal entry and enable illegal stay in Italy, under the institute of family reunification, also resorted to sham marriages. The respective “price” would be app.7500 USD-10000 USD.The members of the organised criminal group had a structured, systematic and well-organised network of communications, resorting e.g. to satellite phones, mobile phones (generally registered under false names), Skype, Viber, Tango, and Facebook. Legal Findings:Against this background, the Public Prosecutor argued for the existence of strong evidentiary indicia on the suspects’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants, in order to obtain a financial or other material benefit.  This organised criminal group would operate (at least) in Eritrea, Sudan, Maghreb countries and Italy. The members of the organised criminal group would also be involved in related offences (e.g. inhuman and degrading treatment as per conditions the migrants were submitted to during the crossing of the Channel of Sicily, and crimes against the public order as per production and procurement of false documents). The Public Prosecutor determined the precautionary detention of the suspects.

"On 10 September 2013, a Frontex Romanian patrol ship signalled to Italian authorities that, in international waters, a larger vessel* (so-called mother vessel) was boarding a significant number of people into a smaller vessel it had been towing. This operation took approximately 45 minutes, after which the two vessels separated. The mother-vessel turned 180º and headed back towards the Nord of Africa. The small vessel headed towards the coast of Sicily (Italy). The small vessel, given its precarious conditions, was rescued by an Italian ship of the Guardia di Finanza. The small vessel was abandoned adrift. The 199 migrants rescued arrived to the port of Siracusa (Italy) on 12 September 2013.Meanwhile, the Frontex Romanian ship had followed the mother-vessel. On 11 September 2013, the Frontex ship approached the mother-vessel to take photographs of it. It observed it masted no flag. At the request of the Frontex officials, the crew of the mother-vessel (15 men) presented identity documents in Arabic. They alleged to be fishermen. In the late afternoon, a ship of the Italian Guardia di Finanziajoined the Frontex ship and boarded the mother-vessel. The crew was arrested and the vessel was confiscated. The related investigations integrated a larger investigation (initiated in July 2013) into the actions of an organised criminal group composed of Italians and Egyptians intended to procure the illegal entry into Italy of migrants coming from certain African and Middle East countries, in exchange for financial gain. Mostly through electronic surveillance, it was possible to confirm the existence of a well-structured organised criminal group, composed of several individuals with specific tasks and access to robust resources, dedicated to facilitating the illegal entry in Italy of migrants. The criminal group carried out its criminal plan systematically and repeatedly, on the basis of the mother-vessel modus operandi as explained above. Investigations demonstrated that every crossing was monitored by the base in Egypt as well as by the support unit in Sicily (Italy) and the crew at sea. The commander of the Frontex ship and, at least, two migrants, identified the appellant as a member of the crew of the mother-vessel, who was tasked with controlling and managing the migrants. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on the outcome of searches and seizures (namely of the vessels used in the smuggling venture), testimonial evidence from migrants (at least five), documental evidence (e.g. statement of boarding carried out by the Romanian Frontex patrol ship), photo identification, interception of communications and corresponding verification diligences carried out by investigative authorities. Legal findings:In review, the Court of Catania upheld the decision of the Judge for Preliminary Investigations that determinedthe precautionary detention of the appellant, deeming there were strong indicia of responsibility for the crimes of aggravated migrant smuggling and participation in a criminal group (associazione a delinquere) dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. The Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. For further details, see “Other background” under “Accused Persons” and and “Commentary”. --- * Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"On 15 October 2013, the Italian Navy rescued 211 migrants (several nationalities) from international waters. On 3 November 2013, 29 migrants coming from Libya (26 Palestinians, two Syrians and one Eritrean) were also rescued in the same terms. The migrants were led to the local reception centre. Some of the migrants arrived on 15 October to the reception centre (six in particular) rebelled against one of the new arrivals, in what appeared to develop into a lynching attempt. After inquiry by the authorities, the migrants explained that the target of their rage was the defendant, who had been identified as the smuggler to whom the migrants had paid for the trip to Italy. These migrants were later heard in the context of the institute of incidente probatorio. Authorities also heard at least four of the migrants rescued on 3 November 2013. It was determined as follows:The defendant is within the higher ranks of an organised criminal group in Libya, dedicated to the smuggling of migrants into Italy. In his operations, the defendant was assisted by several men armed with machine guns. He was contacted by the migrants via telephone, upon the advice of friends or relatives. The defendant gave them instructions on the modalities of payment (app.1600-1800 USD). The migrants were kept in hiding, in a house in Sabratah (close to Tripoli, Libya), under the surveillance of armed men, who did not allow the migrants to leave even to buy food.During the stay in this house, the defendant was amongst those that went to deliver bread and water to the migrants.On the day of the trip, when migrants were to pass from the smaller boat to the larger ship, the defendant, together with armed men escorting him, deprived the migrants of all their possessions.(money, passports, mobile phones, etc).The defendant drove the boat that sank on 3 November 2013. In addition to their statements, migrants proceeded to photo identification of the defendant. The authorities were able to confirm the phone numbers referred by the migrants as pertaining to the defendant. A search was carried out into the belongings of the defendant, therefrom resulting different passports certifying identity different from the one asserted by the defendant. The records of the Coast Guard of Lampedusa (Italy) were admitted as evidence. The defendant himself was heard. The Court took into account a range of circumstantial evidence, from the deceiving manoeuvres of the defendant, emotional reaction of migrants to the arrival of the defendant in the reception centre, and items found in possession of the defendant (e.g. various communication devices). Legal findings:The Court stressed the existence of aggravating circumstances given the (i) intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) transnational character of the operations of the organised criminal group, (iii) danger to life and safety of migrants, and (iv) inhuman treatment. The Court convicted the accused for participation in a criminal conspiracy dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and for procuring illegal entry in Italy.

"On 8 August 2013, the control center of the harbormaster’s office in Rome (Italy) announced it had diverted the “Britta K” motor ship, flying the Lebanese flag, in order to render assistance to a boat in distress carrying several migrants in direction to Lampedusa (Italy).  The motor ship rescued the migrants and led them to the port of Pozzallo, Ragusa (taly). From verifications carried out by the Criminal Police, and the declarations of migrants (some of whom heard in the context of the institute of incidente probatorio), strong indicia emerged on the existence of an organized criminal group dedicated, upon payment, to the smuggling of migrants. In the current case, the rescued boat had departed from Libya and transported over 100 individuals from various nationalities, with the purpose of procuring their illegal entry in Italy. The suspect (and one other individual), who was photographically identified by migrants, operated the boat.  During the journey, due to the overloading and precarious conditions of the boat, two passengers fell in the sea and drowned.  The persons at the helm of the boat did not attempt to help them, rather re-initiating the engine.It was further ascertained that, before departure, migrants had been informed that two Egyptian men (not amongst them) would drive the boat. When such men appeared (including the suspect), they covered their faces so as to avoid recognition. The suspect and his accomplice had then started a discussion with the other smugglers re payment amount. Legal findings:The Supreme Court upheld the precautionary detention previously reversed by the Court of Catania (Italy) and sent the case back to this latter court for review.

"Investigations disclosed the existence of a robust organised criminal group dedicated, in a systematic and reiterated manner, to the smuggling of migrants into Italy, with the purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit. The organised criminal group was based in Libya and composed mostly of Libyan, Syrian and Tunisian. The organised criminal group charged 3000 Euro per person for the trip from Libya to Italy. It owned estates in the Libyan coast where migrants were kept until the moment of departure. The first part of the trip was made in a larger, more robust vessel* (mother-vessel) and the second and last part proceed in a small, precarious and unseaworthy vessel.The appellant was accused of having helmed the small vessel(with 16 migrants on board) after it separated from the mother-vessel. The small vessel was rescued by a vessel flying the Liberian flag, which later brought the migrants to the Port of Pozzallo, in Sicily (Italy).In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on testimonial evidence and interception of communications. Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor accused the defendant of migrant smuggling and ordered his precautionary detention. The Judge for Preliminary Investigations confirmed the precautionary detention. In review, the Court of Catania (Italy) annulled the decision of the Judge for Preliminary Investigations and ordered the release of the defendant.The Court of Cassation partially annulled the appealed decision. For further details, see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”. --- * Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"On 29 January 2014, aerial and maritime units of the Italian Navy traced two ships (in convoy) in direction to the coast of Sicily (Italy). Later that day, while the small boat (in wood, with no flag or identifiers and carrying an extremely elevated number of people) continued in route towards Sicily, the larger vessel had turned in the opposite direction, navigating towards the North of Africa. Given the precarious and overcrowded conditions of the small boat, the Italian authorities proceeded to its rescue in the context of a Search and Rescue (SAR) operation. On 31 January, 176 migrants arrived to the port of Augusta (Italy). Meanwhile, another Italian vessel had followed the larger ship (Mother-Vessel). It realised the latter held not flag and was performing a range of intended deceiving manoeuvres. Accordingly, it intercepted the Mother-Vessel and exercised its right of visit. The boat was seized and the crew arrested. According to (i) records of seizure of the ship transporting the migrants and the Mother-Vessel, (ii) verifications carried out by the Navy, (iii)    statement by some of the migrants, who were heard as suspects of the related contravvenzione coif illegal immigration, (iv) photo identification of the suspect by migrants, it was determined as followsThe migrants were original from several African countries. They went to Egypt, where they contacted intermediaries of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants to Italy, upon payment of 3500 USD per person.Some migrants were taken and hidden in the countryside, under the surveillance of armed men. They were transferred in groups of 25, made to board a wooden boat and then (after app. 1 day trip) led to a larger iron ship, where they were made to remain hidden.After a five-day trip, the migrants were again transferred to a smaller boat, together with five members of the crew, following which they were rescued by Italian authorities.The crew members often communicated with their partners in land through a satellite phone.The suspect in the proceedings was identified as part of the crew of the Mother-Vessel, having steered it until the transfer to the smaller boat. Legal findings:The Court of Catania concluded for the existence of strong indicia of the suspect’s responsibility in procuring the illegal entry of migrants in Italy through a well structured transnational organised criminal group.The Court considered there to be aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) the number of migrants transported (much higher than five), (iii) the number of perpetrators (more than three) and (iv) the risk to the life and safety of migrants, made to travel in an inadequate and deteriorated ship, overcrowded and with no safety equipment, (iv) transnational character of the operations of the organised criminal group.Against this background, the Court confirmed the remand in custody of the accused, considering that, were him to be released, there would be (a) risk of recidivism, (b) risk of escape, (c) risk of tempering with evidence. For further details, see infra under “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"This case regards the investigation and criminal proceedings of three Italian nationals regarding transnational illicit trafficking of arms and dual-use items.Following an injunction issued by the Antimafia District Directorate (DDA) in Naples, three Italian nationals were arrested by the tax unit of the Italian financial police (Polizia Tributaria della Guardia di Finanza) in Venice on 31 January 31, 2017. Mario Di Leva, Annamaria Fontana, and Andrea Pardi, the CEO of Società Italiana Elicotteri (a company that specializes in the supply of new and used helicopters and spare parts), were charged with trafficking arms and dual-use items to Libya and Iran, in violation of both countries' arms embargoes, between 2011 and 2015. The goods were negotiated and sold in a number of African, Asian, and European countries. Without passing through Italian territory, the products were shipped to Iran and Libya.The illegal trade included the selling of anti-tank and surface-to-air missiles, helicopter spare parts, and ammunition made in the Soviet Union. Three A129 Mangusta helicopters, a number of MI-17 Soviet attack helicopters, an air ambulance convertible for military use, 12 engine shut-off units for aircraft, 13,950 M14 rifles, and other rockets and explosives were apparently included in another deal that was thwarted by the arrests. The DDA ordered the suspects' detention after several years of surveillance because they had implemented audio surveillance countermeasures and were considered a flight risk. During later investigations, the DDA discovered an email order for guns on Di Leva's computer, among other things.",trafficking in firearms,1
"The case originates from investigations conducted by the Anti-Mafia Investigation Department of Milan which ended in October 2007. The main characters in this case, especially those charged with participation in an organized criminal group, are well know since the very first proceeding against organized crime in the north of Italy. This first proceeding, called ""Nord-Sud"" showed the existence of an organized criminal group in the north of Italy, but linked with the southern 'Ndrangheta, a criminal organization in Calabria.Many other proceedings occurred afterwards, until the so called Cerberus process which resulted in the accusation and conviction of an organized criminal group operating in the area around Milan. However, a part of this group regenerated and continued its activities with the accused convicted in the case of reference, with similar characteristics.Italian authorities kept on investigating on this very well structured criminal group which  operates in the construction industry and real estates’ brokerage, disrespectful of competition, market rules and legality.",trafficking in firearms,0
"JF and JE, husband and wife, were both convicted of aggravated human trafficking and facilitating illegal entry. JF was also convicted of drug related offences.The couple, in collaboration with organised criminal groups operating transnationally, were involved in the recruitment, transportation and harbouring of two Nigerian girls (victim1 and victim2), one of whom was a minor,  in order to employ them in the Italian prostitution market and profit from them financially. The victims’ journey from Nigeria to Italy involved the crossing of Niger and Libya and was organised and paid for by the defendants. The fee for transportation ranged from 15.000,00 to 25.000,00 euros, which the girls had to pay back through their work.   The victims were repeatedly subjected to physical violence at the hands of both defendants and were constantly threatened. Before leaving Nigeria, the victims were forced to undergo a voodoo ritual. This meant they believed that if they were to escape, not repay their debt or talk to the police they would be killed, or their families would be harmed. The defendants had different roles within the criminal activity. JE took care of the recruitment of the girls, the voodoo rituals, the organisation of transport to Italy and payment to the criminal groups. She also acted as a ‘madame’, teaching the girls how to solicit customers and how much they should charge the clients. She was responsible for deflowering victim 1 with a banana and threatened the families of the victims after the police raided the house where they were staying and took them to secure accommodation.JF took care of arranging transportation of the victims to Catania and personally pick up the victims and took them to the house he shared with his wife.  He was also in charge of the ‘bookkeeping’ and annotating the respective amounts received by the girls. Based on the testimony of both victims , the evidence collected through phone call surveillance and wiretapping of the prison meetings between JF and his wife, the claims of the defendants, who argued they only rented a room to the girls and knew nothing about their prostitution, were deemed to be false. On 7.10.2019 they were both convicted to 10 years imprisonment and immediate expulsion from Italy upon completion of the sentence.",trafficking in persons,1
"Subject of this case are a series of decisions taken by the Court of preliminary investigations of Palermo and the prosecutor’s office, deciding upon the arrest and detention (or to the prolongation of the detention) of three suspects for the charges of human trafficking, torture, murder, sexual assault, enabling clandestine migration and kidnapping of hundreds of men, women and children in Libya. The three suspects were accused of forming an organized criminal group and using an abandoned military base as an illegal “prison” in Libya, where migrants were forcibly detained, tortured, beaten and abused in order to coerce them or their families into paying a “liberation fee”. If no payment was made, then victims would either be tortured, killed, or sold to other traffickers for the purpose of sexual or labour exploitation. The head of the organization, a Libyan national, was responsible for running the prison and coordinating with different actors of the organization, including taxi drivers and local police officers who would deliver victims to the prison or other traffickers that would sell victims to the organization. The two other suspects, a Guinean and an Egyptian national, worked as armed prison guards, regularly abusing detainees and occasionally torturing and killing them. All suspects arrived irregularly to Italy, together with 56 other migrants who were rescued by an NGO off the Libyan coast. The suspects continuously denied allegations and claimed they were themselves held prisoners in the facility. Six victims, all of which had spent several months detained by the suspects, came forward and recognized them as the one responsible running / working in the illegal prison. Victims also mentioned several other individuals, all male from different nationalities, that were involved in the criminal organization.",trafficking in persons,1
"IC was convicted of: heading and running an organised criminal network for the purposes of human trafficking; aggravated human trafficking; heading and running an organised criminal network for the purposes of facilitating illegal immigration; facilitating illegal immigration.   PG was convicted of two offences, namely: aggravated human trafficking and facilitating illegal immigration.   In collaboration with organised criminal groups operating transnationally, IC and PG were involved in the recruitment, transportation and harbouring of young Nigerian women in order to exploit them for use in the Italian prostitution market and in that of several other European countries (Belgium, Germany, UK, and Spain) and to procure such young girls for third-party ‘madames’ throughout Europe, and profit from them financially.   The victims’ journey from Nigeria to Italy involved the crossing of Niger and Libya and was possible due to the defendants’ close relationship with Libyan traffickers with whom they were in constant contact at every stage of the young women’s journey. This was very well coordinated and involved military like control, corruption of border authorities and para-entrepreneurial planning.    IC and PG took care of the transportation fee, and charged the victims up to 45,000 euros, which the women had to pay back through their work. The defendants also provided the women with the ‘story’ to tell to the authorities in order to get relevant residence documents.   Before leaving Nigeria, the victims were forced to undergo a voodoo ritual. This meant they believed that if they were to escape, not repay their debt or talk to the police they would be killed, or their families would be harmed.

"The investigations began with the rescue of an inflatable boat in international waters carrying eighty-nine people from Central Africa by the merchant ship ""Gaz Concord'', flying the Panamanian flag, following precise instructions received from the General Command of the Port Authorities of Rome, on 16 February 2015. The migrants rescued were accompanied and landed in the harbor of Pozzallo, and then allocated to the annexed receiving centre.In consideration of the fact that nine of the immigrants were women, all of Nigerian nationality, and considering the standardized ways in which young Africans living in Italy are recruited to perform prostitution, the Italian Flying Squad decided to start appropriate investigations and proceeded, therefore, to informally recognize the aforesaid women as potential victims of trafficking.Among the women rescued, a young woman, Anonymous 1, reported on 19 February 2015 that she left Nigeria to overcome the conditions of extreme poverty in which she lived with her brothers and recounted in detail the journey she made to Italy. She decided to depart on the recommendation of an acquaintance called ""Collins"", who told her that one of his sisters was in Italy, ""Mrs. Faith"" (identified as Ogagaoghene Ejiro Oghene), would help her. Anonymous 1 left Nigeria in November 2014 and, passing through Niger, arrived illegally in Libya: at first in the city of Gadron, and then in Saba. During the further transfer to the city of Tripoli, she was stopped, identified and kidnapped by some young people who had closed her in a structure similar to a prison together with several other men and women.After approximately one month she was released thanks to the intercession of a certain ""Samuel"", also known as “Papa” or “Pape”, a Nigerian citizen about forty years old, who, when presenting himself at the place of imprisonment, told her that he was sent by Mrs. Faith, who had paid for her release and to whom she should return the money for the ransom, as well as the cost of the journey, once she arrived in Italy. Samuel then took her to another Libyan locality, to an apartment with him and another woman who, like her, was detained for a month without the possibility of leaving the house. On that occasion, the girl was informed by Samuel himself that, once in Italy, she was supposed to be a prostitute until she had paid her debt with Mrs. Faith.Saturday 14 February 2015, another Libyan man arrived at the home to pick up the two women and take them by car to a shed where they found many other people, all destined to leave for Italy. Shortly afterwards, they were deprived of their belongings, and transferred by Libyan men to a beach from where they then boarded. According to Samuel's indications, once in Italy, the girl had to contact ""Mrs. Faith"" at the telephone number provided by the aforementioned Collins, so that the woman could pick her up at the center where she would have been located.Based on the statements made by Anonymous 1, the investigative authorities carried out a series of telephonic interceptions. The technical activity provided for, on the one hand, a complete verification of the young woman’s statements and, on the other hand, a broader picture of the criminal dynamics related to the migrants' journeys from Africa to Italy. The telephone interceptions sheds lights on three criminal groups involved in the prostitution sector, and connected to the person of Papa (remaining, at the present, unidentified).On this basis, on 3 November 2015, the Public Prosecutor of the Court of Catania issued a detention order against all persons accused of being involved in the three criminal organizations that trafficked young Nigerian women to Italy for the purpose of prostitution and which, in addition to Ogagaoghene Ejiro Ogagaoghene, included her cousinOju Ogaga Oghene, Oboh Angela, as well as Izogie Felicia Kelechi. In execution of this order, investigators found and identified Anonymous 2, another Nigerian young woman victim of the criminal groups, inside the apartment of Ogagaoghene Ejiro Ogagaoghene.The two identified victims were summoned at the time of the special evidentiary hearing. The statements of the girls enriched the probative framework with reference to the organization of the criminal associations and to the execution of the alleged crimes of trafficking in persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation.A Preliminary Hearing was held on 4 April 2016, during which all the defendants were found guilty of having established and promoted a criminal association dedicated to: a) the trafficking of young Nigerian women, illegally introduced into the Italian State in order to engage them in prostitution; b) inciting and exploitation of the prostitution of the aforementioned women. The accused thus lodged an appeal, which was heard before the Court of Assizes of Appeal in Catania. On 13February 2018, the Court upheld the Preliminary Hearing judgement confirming the guilt of all the accused with respect to their charges, while it re-determined their sanction treatment by reducing their penalties.",trafficking in persons,1
"This is a decision sustaining the pre-trial detention order issued against Deji Gift. The proceedings relate to well structured, transnational criminal organisation operating between Libya (city of Sabhah) and Italy of Ghanaians, Nigerians and Libyans, active in trafficking in persons, facilitation of illegal immigration and commission of serious crimes related to criminal association for kidnapping for extortion, murder and sexual violence. The group was active in migration routes in Africa (Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Guinea) kidnapping migrants in order to profit financially and materially by - what the Court calls - trafficking of contemporary slaves. The modus operandi was based on conspiracy, distinct functions and roles of the members of the group, kidnaping of migrants and payment of ransom to dedicated accounts, using firearms and continuous violence aimed at subjugating and reducing migrants to trafficking and enslavement, sexual violence against women, physical and psychological violence, exchange of control with other groups. This case is linked to criminal proceedings RGNR 3930/2017 (accused were John Ogais and Sam Eric Ackom, who were found guilty for kidnapping, sexual violence, homicide, facilitating irregular migration, and were sentenced to life imprisonment in 2018)  where several of the facts were ascertained.The accused Deji Gift – who was later convicted at secondary level to 24 years of imprisonment- is the third accused in the criminal organisation formed with John Ogais and Sam Ackom, that kidnapped, tortured and sexually abused migrants in Libya en route to Italy. His name surfaced during hearings of migrants witnesses during the proceedings of  RGNR 3930/2017. Multiples testimonies speak about killing and torturing of migrants, raping and sexually abusing women migrants. According to witnesses’ testimonies, the accused was detained and then turned into a torturer.The decision elaborates on exercise of jurisdiction to Italian courts of the alleged offences in accordance with Art. 10 of the Italian Criminal Court and of Art. 3-4  of Law 146/2006 related to offences committed entirely abroad and in more than one country. Reference is also made to UNTOC and Art. 3 (2). The Court ordered the detention of the accused for offences related to a) Article 416 of the Italian Criminal Code and Article 4 of Law 146/2006 in association with Eric Ackom and John Ogais in order to commit several crimes against the person - and in particular crimes of trafficking in persons (Article 601 of the Italian Criminal Code), kidnapping of aggravated persons (Article 630, paragraph 3) c.p.), sexual violence (art. 609 bis c.p.); with the aggravating circumstances; b) Article 110 and 630 of the Italian Criminal Code for depriving migrants of freedom, kidnapping, repeatedly mistreating and torturing migrants (with rubber tubes and electric cables), committing sexual violence against women of the group. Aggravating circumstances were included in the case, i.e. death of kidnapped persons.",trafficking in persons,1
"The defendant was deemed to be a member of a transnational organised criminal group (composed mostly of Somali, Sudanese and Libyan individuals)dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons. In order to achieve these goals, the organised criminal group further engaged in a series of connected and ‘auxiliary’ crimes, namely kidnapping with the purpose of extortion and homicide. The activities of this criminal group occurred mostly in Libya (city of Kufrà) and Italy.The defendant’s role within the said organised criminal group was that of – being armed - monitoring and keeping surveillance over migrants that had been kidnapped and maintained in a slavery-like situation, in a structure known as Hudeyfà (Libya). In so doing, he committed a series of offences against the physical and psychological integrity of migrants. Specifically, upon reaching Libya from their respective countries of origin, the migrants would be coercively detained in Hudeifà. All their possessions were taken by the smugglers. The smugglers would then demand their families for a ransom for their release (up to 5250 USD) and or the fee deemed appropriate for continuation of the journey to Italy. The payments would then occur via the Hawala method. Some migrants declared that the defendant would request the ransom added of 250 USD, which he would directly usurp. Sometimes, the smugglers would torture the migrants and make their families hear their screams over the phone. Once the payments were received, the migrants would either be abandoned in Libya or sold to other smugglers that would facilitate the journey to Italy. Movements between sites occurred by truck or bus.During the kidnapping period, water and food lacked. The migrants were abused and mistreated. This would happen including when they asked for more water or food.  Some, evidenced by marks of torture on their bodies. At least three migrants presented lesions and scars in the abdomen and back consistent with torture imposed via electric cables. Others, declared to have been beaten up with a rubber stick. On 26 May 2017, 307 individuals (including the defendant) were rescued from a vessel*, close to the Libyan coast, by a tugboat. On 27 May 2017, these persons arrived to the port of Lampedusa (Italy) on board of a ship of the Coast Guard that had recovered the said individuals from the tugboat. They were then transferred to the Hotspot of Lampedusa for screening and photograph taking. Following the appropriate assessment, it emerged the 307 migrants did not fulfil the legal requirements to enter and stay in Italy. They were thus irregular migrants. Most migrants were minors.Upon questioning, five migrants declared to have been kidnapped in Kufrà and confirmed the role of the defendant in the context of the organised criminal group that had arranged for their journey to Italy. They further declared that, once in Lampedusa, the defendant had threatened some of them not to give incriminating declarations against him. To others, he had asked for forgiveness. The migrants remained afraid and intimidated.Some migrants declared that deaths had occurred amongst the kidnapped migrants, either due to disease or as a result of torture and mi-treatment. Likewise, some migrants stated to have been told that, before their arrival to the ‘safe house’, few migrants had managed to escape. However, they had been recaptured and killed in front of the other migrants. In establishing the fact, authorities relied muchon testimonial evidence (notably declarations of several smuggled migrants in Lampedusa) and identification of the defendant via photographs. Documentary evidence – notably, photographs of torture marks – taken by the police with the assistance of medical staff was of much importance. These photographs were complemented with expert medical reports. Investigations continued re other alleged members of the organised criminal group. At least one migrant declared that it was planned for other members of the organised criminal group to travel to Europe, from Nigeria, attempting to pass as smuggled migrants. Legal Findings:Against this background, the Public Prosecutor argued for the existence of strong indicia on the defendant’s membership in a transnational organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants (associazione a delinquere). The defendant was thus indicted for migrant smuggling, membership in an organised criminal group, trafficking in persons, and kidnapping with the purpose of extortion.The Prosecution noted the existence of a number of aggravating circumstances. Notably:-       Re membership in an organised criminal group: (i) having carried out the criminal conduct through an organised criminal group operating in more than one State, (ii) more than ten individuals having been involved in the perpetration of the crime;-       Re migrant smuggling: (i) having participated in the smuggling of five or more persons, (ii) having committed the crime in three or more individuals, (iii) purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit with the proscribed conduct, (iv) endangering the life or safety of migrants, (v) submitting migrant to degrading or inhuman treatment. For details on the legal reasoning applied, see infra under “Commentary”. ----* Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

The organised criminal group operated in Nigeria, Maghreb countries (especially Libya) and Italy (Lampedusa, Agrigento, Palermo, Reggio Calabria, Napoli, Padova). The investigations unveiled the membership of the defendants in the organised criminal group and its activities. Investigations are on-going to identify other members thereof. In its order for precautionary detention, the Public Prosecutor identified four defendants: J.O., O.G.A., E.C. and I.B. (see Proc. Nr. 3714/2016 R.G.N.R.). Only J.O. and I.B. are subjects in the decision herein analysed.It was ascertained as follows:Defendant J.O. (a.k.a. V.) holds a dominant position within the associazione a delinquere. She managed direct contacts regarding the recruitment of women in Nigeria, overseeing their transport to Italy in order to be affected to prostitution in several regions of the country as well as abroad.Defendant I.B. (together with E.C.) was in charge of the transportation of the victims to different regions in Italy and their accommodation (where they were often coerced to remain). He further took on the management of several logistical aspects (e.g. telephones, vehicles) necessary to the pursuance of the objectives of the organised criminal group, notably prostitution.The women were controlled much via voodoo rituals (set up by O.G.A.). Three victims were identified. From their statements it emerged this case regards a situation that started as a typical scenario of migrant smuggling: the migrant contacts the smuggler or follows-up on his or her contact in order to arrange for the trip to another country, in the hope of improving life conditions. Progressively, it develops into trafficking in human beings. Indeed, the victims wished to come to Italy, though they were not aware of the intent of the organised criminal group to affect them to prostitution. It was established as follows:The victims agreed to engage in a 30 000 Euro debt with the smugglers corresponding to their trip to Italy and other related expenses. The victims were allured with prospects of regular work in Italy.The agreement was celebrated via voodoo rituals, which inculcated particular fear in the victims and strongly contributed to keeping them attached to the associazione a delinquere.The victims were transported to Libya and kept reclusive against their will in a house, while waiting for being transferred to Italy.In Libya, the victims were informed they would be affected to prostitution in order to pay the debts related to their travel. The victims refused and declared to wish to return to Nigeria, which they were not allowed. They were repeatedly threatened and intimidated, including through voodoo invocation. They received SIM cards to contact J.O. once arrived in Italy.The victims were transported by vessel* to Italy. They arrived to Lampedusa (Italy) on 3 May 2015. They were led to the reception centre of Siculiana (Italy), where they remain until 9 May 2015.  One of the victims (who later pressed charges) left the reception centre under the protection of the International Organisation of Migration to be integrated in a community in Favara (Italy). She was later induced to prostitution by the organised criminal group, via threats and intimidation. The others were picked up by associated of J.O. and taken to the house where they would be prostituted.On 1 March 2016, the victims managed to leave the house of J.O. in Reggio Calabria (Italy) and escape the direct control of J.O. However, they continued with prostitution activities in other localities (e.g. Naples, Italy), given the coercive state the victims were held in and the constant threats, namely by phone.The interception of communications documented references to payments of thousands of Euro made by the victims to J.O. and the organised criminal group. It further clearly revealed the violent nature of threats (including dead threats) of J.O. against the victims and their families. In establishing the fact, authorities relied inter alia in the declarations of victims and surveillance techniques (including interception of communications). Legal Findings:Against this background, the Judge for Preliminary Investigations concluded for the existence of strong indicia on the suspects’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group and participation in an organised criminal group (understood as “associazione a delinquere”as defined in Italian law)dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings, in order to obtain a financial or other material benefit.The Judge for Preliminary Investigations acknowledged the underlying precautionary requirements: (i) risk of escape, enhanced by: (a) the defendants‘ declared intention to go abroad, especially to Nigeria, so as to camouflage traces, (b) the defendants’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group specialised inter alia in facilitating illegal movements across borders, undetected by authorities; (ii) risk of recidivism, for the active role of the suspects in an organised and well-established organised criminal group; (iii) risk of tempering with evidence, including by threatening migrants and or their families.Accordingly, the Judge for Preliminary Investigations confirmed the precautionary detention of the defendants.For details on the legal reasoning applied, see infra under “Commentary”. ---* Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

Investigations are on-going to identify other members of the associazione a delinquere.Specifically:Defendant J.O. (a.k.a. V.) holds a dominant position within the associazione a delinquere insofar as she manages the logistics of the transnational organised criminal group in Italy, collects the profits of prostitution activities, and takes the necessary measures to ensure the victims remain in a situation of dependence and submission to the interests of the criminal network. She, together with defendant O.G.A., carry out a series of intimidating, harming and threatening actions to punish the victims who leave the accommodation unauthorised or to force their return to the prostitution ring once they managed to escape its direct control.Defendant E.C., in close coordination with J.O., was in charge of arranging the transportation of the victims to Italy and making sure it follows as planned.In close coordination with J.O., defendant I.B. provided regular and important logistical support to the associazione a delinquere, namely by renting accommodation where the victims were settled and carried out prostitution activities as well as providing a range of SIM cards through which communication ensued and threats were made in order to keep the victims fearful, intimidated and, consequently, in a state of dependence and vulnerability. Three victims were identified.

The members of the organised criminal group would also be involved in related offences (e.g. inhuman and degrading treatment as per conditions the migrants were submitted to during the crossing of the Channel of Sicily and enforced prostitution). The Public Prosecutor highlighted the underlying precautionary requirements: (i) risk of escape, enhanced by the suspects‘ membership in a transnational organised criminal group whose main purpose is to facilitate the escape of individuals abroad; (ii) risk of recidivism, for the active role of the suspects in an extremely organised and well-established organised criminal group; (iii) risk of tempering with evidence, including by threatening migrants and or their families. For details on the legal reasoning applied, see infra under “Commentary”.--- * Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"In spite of the international public opinion outcry following the tragic shipwreck of 3 April 2013 that happened between the Libyan and Italian coast, causing the deaths of 366 people, the migratory flux did not stop. Among others, on 25/10/2015 the Italian coastal authority registered the arrival on the Italian territory (namely the island of Lampedusa, Sicily) of the accused. Once at the reception centre he was assaulted by a group of shipwreck victims requiring the intervention of the Italian Police to block their attempt to lynch him. During the first investigations the facts surrounding the case at issue emerged.According to the consistent statements rendered by the 7 witnesses, the journey of circa 130 people started in Eritrea, transiting to Ethiopia, Sudan and then Chad (across the desert) to reach Libya and finally, via sea, to Europe (Italy, Lampedusa). The witnesses explained that the journey involved quarantine in an area of the border between Sudan and Chad and in Tripoli, Libya where each migrant had to provide a ransom fee (between 1.000,00-4.000,00 USD) in order to proceed to the next destination. Besides the degrading conditions of the places they were quarantined and of the transfer means (overcrowding leading to death or shipwreck), witnesses also reported cases of torture (i.e. bodies scattered with gasoline so as to cause severe skin pain due to its abrasive nature; people forced to put their feet on wet floors and then electric shocks being delivered; sexual assaults; physical assaults with and without firearms, psychological menace; …), deprivation of personal liberty (oppression), inhuman treatment, extortion and sexual abuse all perpetrated by the defendant.",trafficking in persons,1
"The victim (a minor Ghanaian), after obtaining the status of refugee in Italy, moved to Rosarno in November 2009 in order to find a job as fruit picker. After a few weeks living in an abandoned factory, he was hired by the Defendant, who drove him to a field, where some animals were kept in a barn. The victim was told he would live in such barn, which had no proper roof nor flooring, no water and sanitary system and no electricity. The victim was provided a small electrical generator and a gas cylinder, which he could only use to cook. He had to fetch the water and transport it in jerry cans and slept on a beach chair. The victim had to groom the animals every morning at dawn; at 7 am the defendant would pick him up and drive him to a citrus grove, where he had to pick fruits under the supervision of the defendant or the defendant’s wife. He had to work under all weather conditions and had only a 30 minutes break during the day. After the day at the citrus grove, he had to treat the fruits with some chemicals, which caused his hands an irritation and only then was he given a pair of gloves. Every night he was driven back to the barn. He worked 7 days per week and was paid 20 € per day for the first month.During the second month, the victim worked for two weeks and then, fearing for his life due to the lynching of some Africans in the area in early 2010, he asked the defendant to be paid; the defendant refused to do so, claiming that he would pay him only at the end of the month. The victim could not leave, since he had no money to buy a train ticket and the barn where he was living was 45 minutes walking distance from the closest village. On one occasion the defendant demanded the victim to throw his phone away and, when he refused, he beat him with a stick on the head, causing him a bleeding. Finally, the defendant paid the victim 150 €, using a counterfeit 100 € bill. One day, the victim asked the defendant to stop at a shop to buy a top-up for his phone; once out of the truck, he fled and went to the Police to report what had happened. He was able to produce precise indications such as the perpetrator’s phone number and the licence plate of the truck he drove, as well as the details of the barn he was forced to live in.",trafficking in persons,1

She had no other way of sustain herself and was therefore considered to be in a condition of slavery, since she was completely lacking self-determination possibilities.",trafficking in persons,1

"The applicants’ version of the eventsThree applicants (a husband, wife and their daughter) arrived in Milan on 12 May 2003 following a promise of work by X., a Roma man of Serbian nationality, residing in Italy, who accommodated them in a villa in the village of Ghislarengo. They remained in the villa for several days, during which time they undertook household chores. After a while, X. declared to the father (the second applicant) that Y., his nephew, wanted to marry his daughter (the first applicant). As her parents refused to agree, they were beaten, threatened with death and forced to leave their daughter in Italy and go back to Bulgaria. On 18 May 2003, they went back to Bulgaria. Their daughter was kept under constant surveillance and was forced to steal against her will, was beaten, threatened with death and repeatedly raped by Y. On 24 May 2003, her mother (the third applicant) returned to Italy, accompanied by the first applicant’s sister-in-law (the fourth applicant), and lodged a complaint with the Italian police in Turin, reporting that she and her husband had been beaten and threatened and that the first applicant had been kidnapped. She further feared that her daughter might be led into prostitution. Apparently frustrated with the police’s slowness in responding to the complaint, the second applicant lodged written complaints with many other institutions. It has been shown that, 18 days after the lodging of the complaint, the police raided the house in Ghislarengo, found the first applicant and made a number of arrests.The first applicant was taken to a police station and questioned, in the presence of an interpreter. The applicants alleged that she was treated roughly and threatened that she would be accused of perjury and libel if she did not tell the truth. Allegedly she was then forced to declare that she did not wish her supposed kidnappers to be prosecuted, to answer ‘yes’ to all other questions, and to sign certain documents in Italian, which she did not understand. They also alleged that the interpreter did not do her job properly and remained silent in the face of the treatment being inflicted. The applicants further alleged that Y. was present during certain parts of the first applicant’s questioning. The same allegations came from the third applicant. All the applicants were then taken by the police to the railway station and travelled back to Bulgaria.No criminal proceedings were instituted in Italy against the first applicant’s kidnappers. After June 2003, the applicants sent several letters and emails to the Italian Authorities, with a request to provide them with information about the police raid of 11 June 2003 and to start criminal proceedings against the alleged kidnappers. They also complained that they had suffered threats, humiliation and ill-treatment at the hands of the police. At the same time, they also wrote to Bulgarian Authorities requesting them to protect their rights and assist them in obtaining information from the Italian authorities. The Italian Government’s version of the eventsIt appeared from the documents, that the first applicant made allegations that showed a number of discrepancies with the complaint previously submitted by her mother, and which led the authorities to conclude that no kidnapping, but rather an agreement about a marriage, had in reality taken place between the two families. This conclusion was confirmed by photographs given to the police by X. after the raid, showing a wedding party at which the second applicant received a sum of money from X. When showed the photographs, the first applicant denied that her father had taken money as part of the agreement about the marriage. The third applicant also stated that her daughter had not married Y. of her own free will, and claimed that the photographs were nothing but a fake, taken on purpose by the alleged kidnappers. As a result of these interviews, the Public Prosecutor decided to turn the proceedings against unknown persons for kidnapping into proceedings against the first and third applicants for perjury and libel.In June 2005, the Juvenile Court decided not to proceed with the charges against the first applicant as the offences were one-off and not serious, and therefore ‘socially irrelevant’. In February 2006, the Turin Criminal Court acquitted the third applicant, on the ground that the facts of which she was accused did not subsist.The Bulgarian Government’s version of the eventsOn the basis of the documents produced by the Italian Government, particularly the declarations made by X., Y., and Z., the Bulgarian Government considered the facts to be as follows: The applicants agreed to marry their daughter for the price of the bride of EUR 11,000. After the wedding party and after the price being paid, the bride’s parents left for Bulgaria on 18 May 2003. Following the second applicant’s notification, the Bulgarian authorities took immediate action and the claim was forwarded to the Bulgarian Embassy in Rome. Following an investigation by the Italian authorities, criminal proceedings against the first and third applicants for perjury were initiated. The applicants did not inform the Bulgarian authorities of the latter proceedings.",trafficking in persons,0
"Italian authorities discovered a criminal organization of Nigerians dedicated to trafficking in young Nigerian women and their exploitation as prostitutes.These young women were recruited in the poorest parts of Nigeri. They were attracted by the possibility of living and working in Italy. They were tsmuggled into Italy, with fake documents, and consigned to a maman, who was supposed to find the girls a job as ahairdresser, caregiver or in-house keeper.Unfortunately, the girls were forced by the maman into prostitution and were forced to give them the majority of their income if they ever wished to be released.

These recruiters forced  them to  work for 10-12 hours a day, with no weekly rest. Compensation were far below those provided by national collective agreements and in any case out of proportion to the quantity and quality of work performed. The recruiters hosted them, cramming them in abandoned and decaying houses, with no toilets and furniture. They compelled them to pay disproportionate and excessive prices for the supply of food and drink and transportation to the fields, all of which was deducted from their ""final pay"".",trafficking in persons,0
"The Defendant acted like he owned the Victim, exercising full control over her life and treating her like a commercial good to put on the prostitution market. The victim, living and working illegally in Italy as a prostitute, had undergone a severe surgical operation which had made her unable to work. The Defendant abused her position of vulnerability and sold her to another pimp who later gave her back, because –due to the surgical operation- she could not be exploited as a prostitute. The Defendant subsequently returned her back to her original pimp, considering her “damaged good”.",trafficking in persons,1
"Subject of this case are a series of decisions taken by the Court of preliminary investigations of Palermo and the prosecutor’s office, deciding upon the arrest and detention (or to the prolongation of the detention) of three suspects for the charges of human trafficking, torture, murder, sexual assault, enabling clandestine migration and kidnapping of hundreds of men, women and children in Libya. The three suspects were accused of forming an organized criminal group and using an abandoned military base as an illegal “prison” in Libya, where migrants were forcibly detained, tortured, beaten and abused in order to coerce them or their families into paying a “liberation fee”. If no payment was made, then victims would either be tortured, killed, or sold to other traffickers for the purpose of sexual or labour exploitation. The head of the organization, a Libyan national, was responsible for running the prison and coordinating with different actors of the organization, including taxi drivers and local police officers who would deliver victims to the prison or other traffickers that would sell victims to the organization. The two other suspects, a Guinean and an Egyptian national, worked as armed prison guards, regularly abusing detainees and occasionally torturing and killing them. All suspects arrived irregularly to Italy, together with 56 other migrants who were rescued by an NGO off the Libyan coast. The suspects continuously denied allegations and claimed they were themselves held prisoners in the facility. Six victims, all of which had spent several months detained by the suspects, came forward and recognized them as the one responsible running / working in the illegal prison. Victims also mentioned several other individuals, all male from different nationalities, that were involved in the criminal organization.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"IC was convicted of: heading and running an organised criminal network for the purposes of human trafficking; aggravated human trafficking; heading and running an organised criminal network for the purposes of facilitating illegal immigration; facilitating illegal immigration.   PG was convicted of two offences, namely: aggravated human trafficking and facilitating illegal immigration.   In collaboration with organised criminal groups operating transnationally, IC and PG were involved in the recruitment, transportation and harbouring of young Nigerian women in order to exploit them for use in the Italian prostitution market and in that of several other European countries (Belgium, Germany, UK, and Spain) and to procure such young girls for third-party ‘madames’ throughout Europe, and profit from them financially.   The victims’ journey from Nigeria to Italy involved the crossing of Niger and Libya and was possible due to the defendants’ close relationship with Libyan traffickers with whom they were in constant contact at every stage of the young women’s journey. This was very well coordinated and involved military like control, corruption of border authorities and para-entrepreneurial planning.    IC and PG took care of the transportation fee, and charged the victims up to 45,000 euros, which the women had to pay back through their work. The defendants also provided the women with the ‘story’ to tell to the authorities in order to get relevant residence documents.   Before leaving Nigeria, the victims were forced to undergo a voodoo ritual. This meant they believed that if they were to escape, not repay their debt or talk to the police they would be killed, or their families would be harmed. This gave the defendants very useful leverage over the young women.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The investigations began with the rescue of an inflatable boat in international waters carrying eighty-nine people from Central Africa by the merchant ship ""Gaz Concord'', flying the Panamanian flag, following precise instructions received from the General Command of the Port Authorities of Rome, on 16 February 2015. The migrants rescued were accompanied and landed in the harbor of Pozzallo, and then allocated to the annexed receiving centre.In consideration of the fact that nine of the immigrants were women, all of Nigerian nationality, and considering the standardized ways in which young Africans living in Italy are recruited to perform prostitution, the Italian Flying Squad decided to start appropriate investigations and proceeded, therefore, to informally recognize the aforesaid women as potential victims of trafficking.Among the women rescued, a young woman, Anonymous 1, reported on 19 February 2015 that she left Nigeria to overcome the conditions of extreme poverty in which she lived with her brothers and recounted in detail the journey she made to Italy. She decided to depart on the recommendation of an acquaintance called ""Collins"", who told her that one of his sisters was in Italy, ""Mrs. Faith"" (identified as Ogagaoghene Ejiro Oghene), would help her. Anonymous 1 left Nigeria in November 2014 and, passing through Niger, arrived illegally in Libya: at first in the city of Gadron, and then in Saba. During the further transfer to the city of Tripoli, she was stopped, identified and kidnapped by some young people who had closed her in a structure similar to a prison together with several other men and women.After approximately one month she was released thanks to the intercession of a certain ""Samuel"", also known as “Papa” or “Pape”, a Nigerian citizen about forty years old, who, when presenting himself at the place of imprisonment, told her that he was sent by Mrs. Faith, who had paid for her release and to whom she should return the money for the ransom, as well as the cost of the journey, once she arrived in Italy. Samuel then took her to another Libyan locality, to an apartment with him and another woman who, like her, was detained for a month without the possibility of leaving the house. On that occasion, the girl was informed by Samuel himself that, once in Italy, she was supposed to be a prostitute until she had paid her debt with Mrs. Faith.Saturday 14 February 2015, another Libyan man arrived at the home to pick up the two women and take them by car to a shed where they found many other people, all destined to leave for Italy. Shortly afterwards, they were deprived of their belongings, and transferred by Libyan men to a beach from where they then boarded. According to Samuel's indications, once in Italy, the girl had to contact ""Mrs. Faith"" at the telephone number provided by the aforementioned Collins, so that the woman could pick her up at the center where she would have been located.Based on the statements made by Anonymous 1, the investigative authorities carried out a series of telephonic interceptions. The technical activity provided for, on the one hand, a complete verification of the young woman’s statements and, on the other hand, a broader picture of the criminal dynamics related to the migrants' journeys from Africa to Italy. The telephone interceptions sheds lights on three criminal groups involved in the prostitution sector, and connected to the person of Papa (remaining, at the present, unidentified).On this basis, on 3 November 2015, the Public Prosecutor of the Court of Catania issued a detention order against all persons accused of being involved in the three criminal organizations that trafficked young Nigerian women to Italy for the purpose of prostitution and which, in addition to Ogagaoghene Ejiro Ogagaoghene, included her cousinOju Ogaga Oghene, Oboh Angela, as well as Izogie Felicia Kelechi. In execution of this order, investigators found and identified Anonymous 2, another Nigerian young woman victim of the criminal groups, inside the apartment of Ogagaoghene Ejiro Ogagaoghene.The two identified victims were summoned at the time of the special evidentiary hearing. The statements of the girls enriched the probative framework with reference to the organization of the criminal associations and to the execution of the alleged crimes of trafficking in persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation.A Preliminary Hearing was held on 4 April 2016, during which all the defendants were found guilty of having established and promoted a criminal association dedicated to: a) the trafficking of young Nigerian women, illegally introduced into the Italian State in order to engage them in prostitution; b) inciting and exploitation of the prostitution of the aforementioned women. The accused thus lodged an appeal, which was heard before the Court of Assizes of Appeal in Catania. On 13February 2018, the Court upheld the Preliminary Hearing judgement confirming the guilt of all the accused with respect to their charges, while it re-determined their sanction treatment by reducing their penalties.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"This is a decision sustaining the pre-trial detention order issued against Deji Gift. The proceedings relate to well structured, transnational criminal organisation operating between Libya (city of Sabhah) and Italy of Ghanaians, Nigerians and Libyans, active in trafficking in persons, facilitation of illegal immigration and commission of serious crimes related to criminal association for kidnapping for extortion, murder and sexual violence. The group was active in migration routes in Africa (Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Guinea) kidnapping migrants in order to profit financially and materially by - what the Court calls - trafficking of contemporary slaves. The modus operandi was based on conspiracy, distinct functions and roles of the members of the group, kidnaping of migrants and payment of ransom to dedicated accounts, using firearms and continuous violence aimed at subjugating and reducing migrants to trafficking and enslavement, sexual violence against women, physical and psychological violence, exchange of control with other groups. This case is linked to criminal proceedings RGNR 3930/2017 (accused were John Ogais and Sam Eric Ackom, who were found guilty for kidnapping, sexual violence, homicide, facilitating irregular migration, and were sentenced to life imprisonment in 2018)  where several of the facts were ascertained.The accused Deji Gift – who was later convicted at secondary level to 24 years of imprisonment- is the third accused in the criminal organisation formed with John Ogais and Sam Ackom, that kidnapped, tortured and sexually abused migrants in Libya en route to Italy. His name surfaced during hearings of migrants witnesses during the proceedings of  RGNR 3930/2017. Multiples testimonies speak about killing and torturing of migrants, raping and sexually abusing women migrants. According to witnesses’ testimonies, the accused was detained and then turned into a torturer.The decision elaborates on exercise of jurisdiction to Italian courts of the alleged offences in accordance with Art. 10 of the Italian Criminal Court and of Art. 3-4  of Law 146/2006 related to offences committed entirely abroad and in more than one country. Reference is also made to UNTOC and Art. 3 (2). The Court ordered the detention of the accused for offences related to a) Article 416 of the Italian Criminal Code and Article 4 of Law 146/2006 in association with Eric Ackom and John Ogais in order to commit several crimes against the person - and in particular crimes of trafficking in persons (Article 601 of the Italian Criminal Code), kidnapping of aggravated persons (Article 630, paragraph 3) c.p.), sexual violence (art. 609 bis c.p.); with the aggravating circumstances; b) Article 110 and 630 of the Italian Criminal Code for depriving migrants of freedom, kidnapping, repeatedly mistreating and torturing migrants (with rubber tubes and electric cables), committing sexual violence against women of the group.

"Between the years of 2015 and 2016, the Somalian defendant in the case, Matammud Osman, on behalf of a large transnational organized criminal group, was charged with procuring the illegal entry of hundreds of migrants to Italy. Their journey, on board minibuses and vessels, often in precarious conditions, was escorted by armed men of the organization. The journey began in Somalia, continued through Ethiopia, Sudan and Libya, with the final destination being the Italian coasts. Throughout the 2-years prolonged criminal activity, the defendant was in charge of two illegal detention camps in Libya: Bani Walid and Sabratah. Inside these camps, hundreds of Somali citizens, women, men and also minors, were kept prisoners and held in often precarious hygienic conditions. Migrants were completely deprived of their personal freedom, having no opportunity to escape. On a daily basis - as a way to punish the non-payment of the sum agreed for the smuggling operation (in most cases around 7,000 USD) - the defendant and his co-conspiritors would regularly go inside the camps to take Somali male citizens to a ""torture room"". There, they were tortured through electric shocks, whips, hit with sticks and iron bars, or left for hours dehydrated under the sun, causing them fractures and in some cases even death. Another type of violence, allegedly perpetrated by the defendant and his men towards migrants, was to cause severe burns by setting fire to plastic bags that were placed on the migrants' backs. These acts of torture were perpetuated in order to give a ""warning"" to other prisoners about the consequences to which they would be exposed in case of rebellion or in case their payment would not come on time.The inhuman and degrading treatments committed against women, on the other hand, were mainly of sexual nature. The victims, many of them minors at the time, experienced rape and other sexual violence on a daily basis. The defendant, through threats of death and physical violence (beating them with fists, kicks, with a belt and with sticks), prevented them from any possibility of movement and would then, since some of them were infibulated girls, open their vaginas with metal instruments in order to penetrate them for the first time.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The defendant was deemed to be a member of a transnational organised criminal group (composed mostly of Somali, Sudanese and Libyan individuals)dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons. In order to achieve these goals, the organised criminal group further engaged in a series of connected and ‘auxiliary’ crimes, namely kidnapping with the purpose of extortion and homicide. The activities of this criminal group occurred mostly in Libya (city of Kufrà) and Italy.The defendant’s role within the said organised criminal group was that of – being armed - monitoring and keeping surveillance over migrants that had been kidnapped and maintained in a slavery-like situation, in a structure known as Hudeyfà (Libya). In so doing, he committed a series of offences against the physical and psychological integrity of migrants. Specifically, upon reaching Libya from their respective countries of origin, the migrants would be coercively detained in Hudeifà. All their possessions were taken by the smugglers. The smugglers would then demand their families for a ransom for their release (up to 5250 USD) and or the fee deemed appropriate for continuation of the journey to Italy. The payments would then occur via the Hawala method. Some migrants declared that the defendant would request the ransom added of 250 USD, which he would directly usurp. Sometimes, the smugglers would torture the migrants and make their families hear their screams over the phone. Once the payments were received, the migrants would either be abandoned in Libya or sold to other smugglers that would facilitate the journey to Italy. Movements between sites occurred by truck or bus.During the kidnapping period, water and food lacked. The migrants were abused and mistreated. This would happen including when they asked for more water or food.  Some, evidenced by marks of torture on their bodies. At least three migrants presented lesions and scars in the abdomen and back consistent with torture imposed via electric cables. Others, declared to have been beaten up with a rubber stick. On 26 May 2017, 307 individuals (including the defendant) were rescued from a vessel*, close to the Libyan coast, by a tugboat. On 27 May 2017, these persons arrived to the port of Lampedusa (Italy) on board of a ship of the Coast Guard that had recovered the said individuals from the tugboat. They were then transferred to the Hotspot of Lampedusa for screening and photograph taking. Following the appropriate assessment, it emerged the 307 migrants did not fulfil the legal requirements to enter and stay in Italy. They were thus irregular migrants. Most migrants were minors.Upon questioning, five migrants declared to have been kidnapped in Kufrà and confirmed the role of the defendant in the context of the organised criminal group that had arranged for their journey to Italy. They further declared that, once in Lampedusa, the defendant had threatened some of them not to give incriminating declarations against him. To others, he had asked for forgiveness. The migrants remained afraid and intimidated.Some migrants declared that deaths had occurred amongst the kidnapped migrants, either due to disease or as a result of torture and mi-treatment. Likewise, some migrants stated to have been told that, before their arrival to the ‘safe house’, few migrants had managed to escape. However, they had been recaptured and killed in front of the other migrants. In establishing the fact, authorities relied muchon testimonial evidence (notably declarations of several smuggled migrants in Lampedusa) and identification of the defendant via photographs. Documentary evidence – notably, photographs of torture marks – taken by the police with the assistance of medical staff was of much importance. These photographs were complemented with expert medical reports. Investigations continued re other alleged members of the organised criminal group. At least one migrant declared that it was planned for other members of the organised criminal group to travel to Europe, from Nigeria, attempting to pass as smuggled migrants. Legal Findings:Against this background, the Public Prosecutor argued for the existence of strong indicia on the defendant’s membership in a transnational organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants (associazione a delinquere). The defendant was thus indicted for migrant smuggling, membership in an organised criminal group, trafficking in persons, and kidnapping with the purpose of extortion.The Prosecution noted the existence of a number of aggravating circumstances. Notably:-       Re membership in an organised criminal group: (i) having carried out the criminal conduct through an organised criminal group operating in more than one State, (ii) more than ten individuals having been involved in the perpetration of the crime;-       Re migrant smuggling: (i) having participated in the smuggling of five or more persons, (ii) having committed the crime in three or more individuals, (iii) purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit with the proscribed conduct, (iv) endangering the life or safety of migrants, (v) submitting migrant to degrading or inhuman treatment. For details on the legal reasoning applied, see infra under “Commentary”. ----* Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"The defendants were deemed to be members of an organised criminal group dedicated to systematically smuggling migrants from Tunisia to Italy (via Sicily) and, eventually, to other locations in Europe. The organised criminal group facilitated the illegal entry, transit and stay of irregular migrants in Italy (and other European countries, especially France and Belgium) with the purpose of obtaining profit (average of 2000 Euro per person). The smuggling venture was carried out via speed-vessels* and it targeted relatively well-off North African nationals. In addition, the organised criminal group was also involved in tobacco contraband and money laundering.The organised criminal group was well structured, whereby each member had determined tasks assigned. Specifically:-       Defendant 1 was the leader of the organised criminal group, managing and directing it in Tunisia. This entailed (i) collecting and receiving payments, (ii) interacting with interested clients (i.e. migrants to be smuggled), (iii) providing for the necessary means of transport to carry out the planned smuggling ventures from Tunisia to the coast of Italy, (iv) recruiting individuals to master the vessels, (v) reception of, and ‘care’ for the migrants in Italy, (vi) arranging for the eventual continuation of the smuggling venture to other European countries, (vii) managing the proceeds of smuggling activities, including by acquiring new means of transportation (vessels).-       Around 6 September 2016, Defendant 2 provided her husband (i.e. Defendant 1) the funds necessary to acquire vessels to engage in the smuggling ventures.-       Defendants 2, 3 and 4 assisted Defendant 1 in the organisation and promotion of the organised criminal group, especially following the detention of Defendant 1 on 20 October 2016. They were ‘right arms’ of Defendant 1.-       Defendants 5 and 16 were charged in particular with the specifics of acquiring new sea-craft and liaising with in-land associates so as to ensure the reception and ‘care’ of migrants once in Sicily.-       The remaining defendants – all operating in Sicily, in particular in the provinces of Trapani, Agrigento and Palermo – acted under the direct instructions of the ‘organisers’ by receiving/collecting/orienting the smuggled migrants upon their arrival in Italy. They further managed and or directly received payments as well as served as intermediaries between irregular migrants and smugglers operating in other areas that could assist in facilitating the transit to the desired areas/countries of destination. These defendants also provided, if needed, logistical support, e.g. accommodation, transportation in view of future movements.-       Defendants 7 and 14 directly helmed vessels transporting an undetermined number of migrants to Italy.-       Defendant 11 transferred into Italy the proceeds of smuggling of migrants that were still being held abroad. He did so under a modus operandi aimed at, and with the purpose of, concealing the origin of the profits. Importantly, the organised criminal group further used its resources to engage in the contraband of cigarettes and tobacco. The tobacco was received/collected in Tunisia with the purpose of being smuggled into Italy, taking advantage of the criminal enterprise set in motion in order to further smuggling of migrants activities. In this regard, the defendants kept tasks and roles aligned with the description provided above.Through investigations it became clear that this line of ‘business’ was appealing to criminals wanted by Tunisian authorities who saw in it the best option to escaping the reach of justice. The evidence gathered made it very realistic that individuals linked to the Islamic jihad could also resort to the services provided by this organised criminal group. Authorities were able to confirm at least five migrant smuggling episodes, with the following dates of arrival in Italy: (i) 10 October 2016, (ii) 20 October 2016, (iii) 3 December 2016, (iv) 18 February 2017, (v) 17 March 2017.By the same token, authorities were able to document at least two instances of tobacco contraband, which culminated in over 103 kilograms illegally introduced in Italy: (i) 1 September 2016, (ii) 17 March 2017. In establishing the fact, authorities relied muchon testimonial evidence (notably declarations of smuggled migrants and defendants) and surveillance techniques (including interception of communications and personal monitoring), and radiolocation techniques. Legal Findings:Against this background, the Public Prosecutor argued for the existence of strong indicia on the suspects’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants (associazione a delinquere). The defendants were thus indicted for migrant smuggling (for facilitation of illegal entry and or facilitation of illegal stay) and membership in an organised criminal group.The Prosecution noted the existence of a number of aggravating circumstances. Notably:-       Re membership in an organised criminal group: (i) having carried out the criminal conduct through an organised criminal group operating in more than one State, (ii) more than ten individuals having been involved in the perpetration of the crime;-       Re migrant smuggling: (i) having participated in the smuggling of five or more persons, (ii) having committed the crime in three or more individuals, (iii) purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit with the proscribed conduct. For details on the legal reasoning applied, see infra under “Commentary”. ----* Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"The operation originates from the investigations made by the Anti-Mafia Investigation Department of Reggio Calabria, ended in May 2013 with the execution of an order for precautionary custody - issued by the Court Judge- against 22 subjects deemed to belong to Gallicianò 'ndrangheta operates in the municipality of Condofuri and neighboring territories, as well as in the province of Viterbo.The investigative activity, started on September 2009, was divided into two phases. In the first step, the investigations have focused on Nucera family, head of Gallicianò area, and allowed the identification of a well-established money laundering system that starting from Calabria, passed through companies located in Viterbo, and then return in Reggio Calabria area in monthly tranches of 7500 euro and one-off of 50.000 euros, for a total of 600.000 euros. The operation takes its name from this ""recycling"" activity, which has allowed the construction of an entire empire and economic heaven in the province of Viterbo. The organization created a bridge in the Viterbo area, where they set up companies to ""clean"" the money.In the second part, the investigation documented the presence of three ""locals"" of 'ndragheta in the municipality of Condofuri: those of Condofuri Marina, San Carlo, and Gallicianò, detecting the internal dynamics (roles, functions, and evaluations of the structure as well) and criminal activities.The Anti-Mafia District, simultaneously with the enforcement of the restraining order, has ordered the seizure of six companies operating in the transport, fruit and vegetable and real estate sectors.

"This decision relates to the activities of an organised criminal group (associazione a delinquere) dedicated inter alia to migrant smuggling and trafficking in human being for sexual exploitation. The organised criminal group operated in Nigeria, Maghreb countries (especially Libya) and Italy (Lampedusa, Agrigento, Palermo, Reggio Calabria, Napoli, Padova). The investigations unveiled the membership of the defendants in the organised criminal group and its activities. Investigations are on-going to identify other members thereof. In its order for precautionary detention, the Public Prosecutor identified four defendants: J.O., O.G.A., E.C. and I.B. (see Proc. Nr. 3714/2016 R.G.N.R.). Only J.O. and I.B. are subjects in the decision herein analysed.It was ascertained as follows:Defendant J.O. (a.k.a. V.) holds a dominant position within the associazione a delinquere. She managed direct contacts regarding the recruitment of women in Nigeria, overseeing their transport to Italy in order to be affected to prostitution in several regions of the country as well as abroad.Defendant I.B. (together with E.C.) was in charge of the transportation of the victims to different regions in Italy and their accommodation (where they were often coerced to remain). He further took on the management of several logistical aspects (e.g. telephones, vehicles) necessary to the pursuance of the objectives of the organised criminal group, notably prostitution.The women were controlled much via voodoo rituals (set up by O.G.A.). Three victims were identified. From their statements it emerged this case regards a situation that started as a typical scenario of migrant smuggling: the migrant contacts the smuggler or follows-up on his or her contact in order to arrange for the trip to another country, in the hope of improving life conditions. Progressively, it develops into trafficking in human beings. Indeed, the victims wished to come to Italy, though they were not aware of the intent of the organised criminal group to affect them to prostitution. It was established as follows:The victims agreed to engage in a 30 000 Euro debt with the smugglers corresponding to their trip to Italy and other related expenses. The victims were allured with prospects of regular work in Italy.The agreement was celebrated via voodoo rituals, which inculcated particular fear in the victims and strongly contributed to keeping them attached to the associazione a delinquere.The victims were transported to Libya and kept reclusive against their will in a house, while waiting for being transferred to Italy.In Libya, the victims were informed they would be affected to prostitution in order to pay the debts related to their travel. The victims refused and declared to wish to return to Nigeria, which they were not allowed. They were repeatedly threatened and intimidated, including through voodoo invocation. They received SIM cards to contact J.O. once arrived in Italy.The victims were transported by vessel* to Italy. They arrived to Lampedusa (Italy) on 3 May 2015. They were led to the reception centre of Siculiana (Italy), where they remain until 9 May 2015.  One of the victims (who later pressed charges) left the reception centre under the protection of the International Organisation of Migration to be integrated in a community in Favara (Italy). She was later induced to prostitution by the organised criminal group, via threats and intimidation. The others were picked up by associated of J.O. and taken to the house where they would be prostituted.On 1 March 2016, the victims managed to leave the house of J.O. in Reggio Calabria (Italy) and escape the direct control of J.O. However, they continued with prostitution activities in other localities (e.g. Naples, Italy), given the coercive state the victims were held in and the constant threats, namely by phone.The interception of communications documented references to payments of thousands of Euro made by the victims to J.O. and the organised criminal group. It further clearly revealed the violent nature of threats (including dead threats) of J.O. against the victims and their families. In establishing the fact, authorities relied inter alia in the declarations of victims and surveillance techniques (including interception of communications). Legal Findings:Against this background, the Judge for Preliminary Investigations concluded for the existence of strong indicia on the suspects’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group and participation in an organised criminal group (understood as “associazione a delinquere”as defined in Italian law)dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings, in order to obtain a financial or other material benefit.The Judge for Preliminary Investigations acknowledged the underlying precautionary requirements: (i) risk of escape, enhanced by: (a) the defendants‘ declared intention to go abroad, especially to Nigeria, so as to camouflage traces, (b) the defendants’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group specialised inter alia in facilitating illegal movements across borders, undetected by authorities; (ii) risk of recidivism, for the active role of the suspects in an organised and well-established organised criminal group; (iii) risk of tempering with evidence, including by threatening migrants and or their families.Accordingly, the Judge for Preliminary Investigations confirmed the precautionary detention of the defendants.For details on the legal reasoning applied, see infra under “Commentary”. ---* Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"On 8 February 2015, an individual (later identified as the suspect) using an Italian mobile phone informed the International Coordination Centre in Madrid (Spain) that several people (including his brother) were on board a ship in direction to Italy. In order to allow tracing the ship, the suspect communicated the number of the satellite phone on board. The information was passed to the International Coordination Centre in Pratica di Mare (Italy). At the same time, the International Coordination Centre in Rome (Italy) received similar information from an individual in Spain. The Italian Coast Guard managed to track the Thuraya satellite phone: the boat was located in Libyan waters. Several merchant ships changed their route in the attempt of assisting the migrants’ ship. The Italian Navy was also deployed. The migrants were finally found in two sinking dinghy boats. As per declarations of the survivors, it is estimated that 202 people lost their lives.Given the seriousness of the events, the Criminal Police immediately opened investigations. It proceeded to the reconstruction of the facts, took migrants’ declarations, launched phone interceptions (including re the satellite phone), and surveillance operations. The interceptions showed inter alia that during the days of the tragedy, the phone used by the suspect (registered under another name) had repeatedly been in contact with the satellite phone on board of the sank boats. The investigation showed the prominent role of the suspect in the migrants’ smuggling activities object of the proceedings. Such activities result from a criminal conspiracy dedicated to the smuggling of migrants, managed by an organised criminal group of transnational nature (operating at least in Libya and Italy). From the evidence resulted as follows:The suspect’s brother arrived to Libya on the first days of February 2015. He remained in the house of the smugglers. On 6 February, migrants set for Italy in four boats, three of which sank.The suspect had for several times carried out unambiguous actions aimed at procuring the illegal entry of his brothers from Libya into Italy. He communicated directly with the smugglers, addressing them by name. He also effectuated payments: 550 Euros per person.The suspect had been in contact with several intermediaries/smugglers in the attempt of tracing his brother (who was on board one of the dinghy boats and ended up perishing in the sea) and his other brother, still in Libya.The organised criminal group the suspect is part of established collection centres in Libya. Migrants were agglomerated there while awaiting departure to Italy and until they paid for the trip (1100-1200 USD).There are indicia indicating that the suspect, together with other associates, might be involved in procuring illegal entry of migrants by air. However, many of the contacts established in this respect were so via Viber. Thus, further investigation is necessary because access to data in relation to such communication platforms is difficult. The suspect might also be involved in facilitating the illegal stay of migrants, namely while awaiting departure to other countries of the EU (upon payment of 1100-1200 USD). The investigation further unveiled clear evidence of involvement of the suspect in drug trafficking. Legal Findings:Against this background, the Judge of Preliminary Investigations confirms the precautionary detention of the suspect, but highlights that: (i) further investigation is necessary, since though significant circumstantial evidence against the suspect is available, it is not overwhelming; (ii) the investigation shall clarify the specific role of the suspect, who does not appear to be an organiser.In its decision, the Judge notes the prevalent precautionary requirements: risk of flight and risk of recidivism.For further details see infra under “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,0
"On 19 October 2015, Italian authorities were informed of a vessel* carrying out app. 300 migrants, off the coast of Italy, southwest of Capo Passero  (Sicily, Italy). It had no flag or visible identifiers. On 20 October 2015, the Italian Navy rescued the said vessel in international waters. It was ascertained it had departed from Egypt. It had 478 migrants on board, who had paid for the trip. Many had come from different African countries, where they dealt with intermediaries. Contacts sometimes ensued via Facebook. Migrants converged to Egypt, where they were “gathered” by the smugglers, while waiting for the travel. A relatively new modus operandiof smugglers was unveiled.Since the beginning of the trip, the vessel later rescued (first vessel) was always accompanied by another vessel (second vessel), with its own crew. At a certain point, it gained some distance from the migrants’ vessel (first vessel). A migrant woman who spoke English was instructed to call Italian authorities and ask for help, which she did. After the rescue operation by the Italian Navy, and the consequent abandonment of the first vessel, the second vessel retrieved the first vessel and towed it in direction of Egypt. Defendants #1 to #7 were identified as the crew of the first vessel (having thus been detained on 20 October 2015). On 21 October 2015, the Italian Navy detained defendants #8 to #21 (crew of the second vessel) in the course of an inspection in international waters. Aware of this modus operadi, Italian authorities had affected a unit to verify the existence and location of the second vessel. It also displayed no flag or identifiersIn the determination of facts, investigative authorities resorted to (i) declarations of migrants, (ii) photo identification of the defendants by migrants, (iii) records of the rescue operations, (iv) records of inspection to the second vessel. Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor considered the crew of both the first and second vessels (all defendants) were responsible for procuring illegal entry of migrants into Italy but also for participating in an organised criminal group (associazione a delinquere) aimed at facilitating irregular migration. It issued the corresponding orders of precautionary detention. However, the Judge for Preliminary Investigations of Catania confirmed the measure only in respect of defendants #8 to #21, in respect of migrant smuggling. It rejected the measure as far as the participation in an organised criminal group – understood as associazione a delinquere as defined in Italian law - was concerned and with regard to all defendants. The Public Prosecutor appealed of this decision. The Court of Catania upheld the appeal and ordered the precautionary detention of all defendants for both facilitation of irregular migration and participation in an organised criminal group (associazione a delinquere).  It acknowledged the precautionary requirements of (i) risk of escape, (ii) risk of recidivism, and (iii) risk of tampering with evidence.

"On 27 August 2015, the Vessel ‘Poseidon’ (Swedish Coast Guard) arrived to the port of Palermo (Italy) having on board app. 600 migrants. Amongst these, 494 had been transported from Libya to Italy on a 20 meters long boat, deprived of adequate navigability conditions, security systems and clearly overloaded. Around 100 persons were forced to remain throughout the whole trip in the hold of the ship (maximum 150 cm high and four meters wide, with no adequate and available air entries). Importantly, the boat was navigating with the engines on, which were located in the hold. Thus, the migrants therein installed were forced to inhale smokes and gases. These conditions – together with the fact that the crew prevented migrants from coming outside to breath – led to the death of 52 persons by asphyxiation.From the statement of the migrants, photo identification of the suspects, Frontex records, and the verifications carried out by the Criminal Police, it further results as follow:In Libya, the migrants paid app. 1000-1500 Libyan Dinars or 1000 USD for the trip to Italy. After payment, hey stayed in a house guarded by armed men who prevented them from leaving. After app. 20 days in this situation, the migrants were transported to the seaside in small trucks. There, in groups of 20-25, they embarked into small boats. After few hours of navigation, they transferred to a larger ship, in which they attempted to cross the Channel of Sicily.The boat left Libya on 26 August 2015. It was in extremely precarious conditions.Some people were selected, on the basis of racial criteria, to travel in the hold of the ship.The crew (i.e. smugglers) had specific and well-defined roles. B.M. and Z.B. were in charge of driving the boat. The other suspects were responsible for maintaining the order during the trip, notably by preventing those in the hold from coming outside and aggressing them (with bats and knifes) when they tried to do so.The migrants repeatedly informed the crew of the life threatening situation in the hold and, later, of the death of some of them. The crew had no reaction to this information.When recovered in the context of the Search and Rescue (SAR) operation, the bodies already showed signs of rigor mortis. Legal findings:The Preliminary Investigations Judge considered that strong indicia existed of the affiliation of the suspects to an organised criminal group, with transnational character, dedicated to the smuggling of migrants with the purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit. He therefore confirmed their precautionary detention. In so doing, the Judge stressed the precautionary needs: risk of escape, risk of recidivism, and risk of tempering with evidence. These threats were reinforced by the suspect’s involvement in a resourceful and structured organised criminal group (i) dedicated precisely to facilitating illegal movements across countries, (ii) deeply emerged in criminal activities, and (iii) with no reservations in menacing the life and safety of others.

"Investigations disclosed that the appellant occupied a prominent role in a robust organised criminal group dedicated, in a systematic and reiterated manner, to the smuggling of migrants into Italy, with the purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit. The organised criminal group recruited migrants from several African countries and assembled them in Libya. They departed from Tripoli (Libya) by vessel* in direction to the Italian shore. Most of the members of the organised criminal group were Eritrean. The appellant was in charge of assisting the transit of migrants from their points of arrival in the South of Italy to Milan (North of Italy) and countries of Central and Northern Europe. He instructed migrants on the behaviour to adopt in order to elude authorities. He also perceived the payment regarding to his activities of facilitation/assistance.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on testimonial evidence and interception of communications. Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor accused the defendant of migrant smuggling and ordered his precautionary detention. The Judge for Preliminary Investigations confirmed the precautionary detention. In review, the Court of Catania (Italy) confirmed the decision of the Judge for Preliminary Investigations and the defendant appealed. The Court of Cassation upheld the appealed decision. For further details, see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”. --- * Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"On 15 April 2015, an Italian military tugboat arrived to the port of Catania (Italy) with 276 irregular migrants on board. The latter had been rescued off the coast of Libya on 13 April 2015, following a Search and Rescue (SAR) alert. The migrants were travelling in a wooden fishing boat, overloaded, and in precarious conditions. From the (i) records of the SAR operation, (ii) statements of the rescuing tugboat officials, (iii) verifications carried out by the Criminal Police, (iv)  statement of some amongst the migrants, who were heard as suspects in the contravenzzione of illegal immigration,  and (v) photo identification made by the latter, the following was asserted:The migrants were mostly original from the Middle East and Central Africa. Once in Libya, they contacted Libyan intermediaries and smugglers, who connected them with the organised criminal group managing smuggling ventures to Italy. The migrants were then transferred to different houses in Tripoli (Libya).Migrants paid between 4500 and 5000 USD per adult and 1200 Libyan Dinars per child.As departure approached, migrants were directed to a beach close to Sabratah (Libya), where they remained hidden under a marquee. At some point, there was a dispute between two self-proclaimed “bosses”. One of them, avowing himself the “absolute leader”, requires from the other the payment of a pecuniary sum in order to allow the transit of the migrants. The suspect is accompanied of seven men in civilian tenure and one-armed man in military uniform.With several inflatables, the migrants were led in groups of 30 to the fishing boat that would bring them to Italy. In the fishing boat were four Libyan men and another one, who was identified by the migrants as the coxswain. Through photo identification by the interviewed migrants, the coxswain was recognised as the suspect in the proceedings.After approximately 12 hours of navigation, using a Thuraya telephone, the suspect calls a woman, who initially suggests that he turns back as rescuing vessels are taken in other operations. However, the trip continues because migrants refuse to go back. The migrants are finally assisted by an Icelandic merchant vessel and rescued by the Italian tugboat Asso 21, in international waters, and directed to Italy.During rescue, the fishing boat and the tugboat are approached by a speedboat masting the Libyan flag with the writing “Libyan Navy”. The speedboat had on board four men, two of whom armed with Kalashnikov and apparently dressed in military tenure. Some shots were fired into the air to speed up the disembarkment of the migrants, after which the four men led the fishing boat towards the coast of Libya. Legal findings:The Court of Catania concluded for the participation of the suspect in the activities of the transnational organised criminal group, which operated with the purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit. The Court considered there to be aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) the number of migrants transported (much higher than five), and (iii) the risk to the life and safety of migrants, made to travel in an inadequate and deteriorated ship.Against this background, the Court confirmed the remand in custody of the accused, ruling that, were him to be released, there would be (a) risk of recidivism, (b) risk of escape.For further details, see infra “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"The current proceedings emerged as the follow-up of the work developed and findings reached in the so-called Glauco Operation (Case n. 10341/15 R.N. G.I.P.- SHERLOC Case Law Database ID ITAh013), carried out by the same Public Prosecutor Office. The organized criminal group therein identified remains fully operative at a transnational level. It holds cells in places/locations of reference. Its members are attributed specific roles in order to allow the smooth accomplishment of the criminal plan: first, illegal entry of migrants in Italy; second, their transit to final destinations – usually in the North of EU – where migrants join their families or close friends. Migrants pay high prices for the “services” of the criminal network.The investigation was much based on phone tapping and surveillance operations.  The declarations of migrants (including in the context of other proceedings) were also very important. The Criminal Police and Public Prosecutor heard several migrants. Migrants’ photo-identification of the suspects was used as evidence. The Criminal Police carried out verification diligences (including searches) in order to confirm information available through the different sources. As a result, and in addition to the above, the following chain of events and methodology was ascertained:The typical modus operandiof the organised criminal group lies on certain main features. Notably: (i) migrants are illegally introduced in Italy; (ii) migrants are strongly advised to avoid the standard identification procedures, including photographs; (iii) before the conclusion of identification and reception procedures, migrants are assisted in moving towards the North of Italy and, from there, to the North of the E.U., thus precluding the application of national and EU laws on immigration. This major effort to avoid the control of authorities upon arrival relates to the fact that – according to EU law - the administrative procedure aimed at obtaining a residence permit and or refugee status shall be finalised where it is initiated. If migrants are photo identified in Italy, the mentioned administrative procedure is triggered, while migrants usually wish to settle in Nordic countries, either because of more advantageous social benefits therein in place or to join relatives or friends.The smuggling ventures towards Italy are organised in different stages. Migrants are firstly collected and assembled in Libya. G.E. (high rank within the organised criminal group) and his associates receive the migrants that – in some instances – have travelled for months in order to reach Libya. They are kept usually in Zuwhara (Libya), where G.A. has control over houses in which he can accommodate the migrants until the day of departure. Migrants are usually monitored under the threat of weapons.Migrants following the so-called terrestrial route (from several African countries towards Libya) are submitted to aggravated violence (including kidnapping) during the trip, of which G.E. and his associates are aware and accomplices. Migrants must pay smugglers for this trip, and are sometimes held and forced to work as a form of payment. G.E. attributes a number to each ‘client’ in order to better organise the work of the organised criminal group as well as to manage those that have already paid. These records unveils that the organised criminal group manages hundreds of millions of USD just in respect of ‘African smuggling’. To such values must be added the amounts paid in the EU.The migrants are then embarked into all the more precarious boats, usually in direction to Italy. Relying on the Operation Mare Nostrum, smugglers abandon these boats – often in very precarious conditions – in international waters, after launching a request for help to authorities. This part of the smuggling venture (i.e., by sea) is also subject to payment.Once in Italian soil, migrants are again ‘recruited’ by members of the organized criminal group operating in Italy, with the promise of facilitating their further movements, always upon payment. Migrants are demanded different amounts: first, to reach Rome (Italy) or Milan (Italy); second, to go from there to their final destination (Switzerland, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Norway). The trip to Rome or Milan usually occurs by public bus or private vehicles (driven by members or associates of the organized criminal group). The bus is currently a popular and preferred means for smugglers insofar as there is no need to exhibit an identification document in order to buy the ticket or travel. Furthermore, buses are often not subject to search and control operations by authorities (as, e.g., trains and private vehicles). The ‘prices’ vary. Usually migrants are requested 200-400 Euro for one or two days of accommodation in Sicily (Italy) plus the ticket to the North of Italy. Then, they have to pay 1000-2000 Euro to continue the trip towards their final destination. The real ‘price’ will, however, vary according to the economic power of the migrant, which will also determine the ‘quality’ and extent of the ‘services’ provided by the organized criminal group (e.g., for the proper ‘price’, the migrant may be accompanied and accommodated until the final destination).To this effect, the ”agreement” with the migrant to continue relying on the organized criminal group after entry in Italy is crucial. Sometimes, the “agreement” is reached by telephone. The organized criminal group assists the migrant in escaping the reception centre/structure and provides the necessary logistical support (e.g., accommodation) until the trip to the North of Italy. Different methodologies are used to ‘attract clients’: (i) collaboration of migrants living in the reception centres/structures; (ii) contacts through relatives, whereby the later contact the smugglers and these ask for the phone number of the potential ‘client’ in order to formalise details; (iii) direct engagement, whereby smugglers go to the points of entry of migrants and carefully ‘advert’ the available services. Again, all services are dependent on payment.Payments are usually done in advance, without which no ‘service’ will be made available by the organized criminal group. Payments take place through different systems, legal and otherwise: (i) directly in cash; (ii) ‘Hawala’ banking system (based on trust, this modality of payment requires neither the movement of cash by the sender and receiver nor formal registration, thus escaping the scrutiny of authorities and anti-laundry regulations); (iii) through financial services providers that allow a quick and smooth movement of cash, such as Western Union, MoneyGram, and, in Italy, Postpay.The organized criminal group also procures false documents so as to allow migrants to continue their travelling abroad undetected by authorities. There is likewise reference to sham marriages as a means of procuring and or enabling illegal entry, transit and stay.G.E., M.M.Y. (in North Africa) and G.A. (in Italy) are at this stage identified as the main leaders of the organized criminal group, directing operations and or men. However, evidence was gathered showing the essential contribution of all suspects to the smuggling of migrants and related offences carried out by the organized criminal group. They had precise yet varied roles within the organized criminal group, e.g. migrants’ receiver and or collector, driver, hawalar.The investigation individualized several specific episodes/businesses, mostly in relation to the disembarkment of hundreds of migrants in 2014 and 2015 in Sicily. The organised criminal group remains operative. Investigations are on-going with the purpose of identifying the remaining members and associates. The organised criminal group is responsible for smuggling tens of thousands of migrants, in often-inhuman conditions. Legal Findings:The Public Prosecutor argued for the existence of strong evidence on the suspects’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants, in order to obtain a financial or other material benefit.  This organised criminal group operates mostly in Central Africa (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan), Maghreb countries (especially Libya), Italy and the North of Europe (Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Germany). The members of the organised criminal group would also be involved in related offences (e.g. inhuman and degrading treatment as per conditions the migrants were submitted to during the crossing of the Channel of Sicily, and crimes against the public order as per production and procurement of false documents). The Public Prosecutor concluded for the existence of evidence upholding the individual responsibility of all suspects for (i) criminal conspiracy dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and (ii) procuring and or enabling the illegal entry, transit and stay of migrants into Italy (and from there to other EU countries). He stressed the existence of aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) that more than five people were smuggled, (iii) that more than 3 people were engaged in the criminal act, (iv) the danger to the life and safety of migrants, (iv) the inhuman treatment migrants were subjected to, (v) transnational character of the organised criminal group, and (vi) the use of weapons in public. The Public Prosecutor finally highlighted the underlying precautionary requirements: (i) risk of escape, enhanced by the suspects‘ membership in a transnational organised criminal group; (ii) risk of recidivism, for the active role of the suspects in an extremely organised and well-established organised criminal group as well as the expected amelioration on seas and weather condition, which are likely to prompt additional smuggling ventures; (iii) risk of tempering with evidence, including by threatening migrants and or their families. Against this background, the Public Prosecutor determined the precautionary detention of the suspects.

"On 10 September 2013, a ship of the Romanian Navy informed Italian authorities of a vessel* in international waters which appeared to intend to transfer a high number of people into a smaller vessel it had been towing. Shortly after, both vessels were progressing side by side. After the transfer, the small vessel took the direction of Siracusa (Italy) while the larger one (mother-vessel) headed back. On 12 September 2013, 199 migrants were rescued from the smaller vessel by a ship of the Italian Guardia di Finanza. They were taken to Siracusa.Meanwhile the Romanian ship had halted the mother-vessel, which exhibited no flag. It inspected the members of the crew, who presented 15 documents written in Arabic. All declared to be fishermen. A ship of the Italian Guardia di Finanzia joined the Romanian authorities and seized the mother-vessel.Migrants declared to have initiated the smuggling venture in small vessels, which transported them to the mother-vessel. It was in this latter vessel that the majority of the trip occurred.From investigations it emerged that the facts described integrated the systematic practice of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants into Italy, with the purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit. The organised criminal group acted on the basis of the mother-vessel/small-vessel modus operandi, whereby the former (more robust and in better navigability conditions) remains in international waters with the purpose of avoiding the reach of States’ jurisdiction. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, interception of communications, and photo identification. Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor accused the defendants of migrant smuggling and ordered their precautionary detention. The Judge for Preliminary Investigations confirmed the precautionary detention. In review, the Court of Catania (Italy) confirmed the decision of the Judge for Preliminary Investigations and the defendant appealed. The Court of Cassation upheld the appealed decision. For further details, see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”. uuu * Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)).

"On 13 February 2015, following a Search and Rescue (SAR) alert, the Italian Navy vessel Spica rescued 276 migrants in international waters. The merchant ship MSC Belle had previously recovered them from three drifting boats in precarious conditions. Due to the turbulent sea, the migrants arrived in Lampedusa (Italy) only the day after. The Court of Catania – in the proceedings under analysis herein - dealt with the events related to one of those dinghy boats, from where 104 migrants were rescued. As a result of the (i) records of the SAR operation, (ii) statements of the crew of the Navy ship Spica, (iii) verifications carried out by the Criminal Police, (iv)  statements of migrants,  (v) photo identification of the suspect, (vi) confession of the suspect, and (vii) circumstantial evidence, the following was asserted:The migrants were mostly original from Central Africa, in particular Gambia, Chad, Ivory Coast, Senegal and Nigeria. Once in Libya, and after few months in jail, they contacted their countrymen acting as mediators. The latter connected them with the organised criminal group managing illegal trips to Italy in exchange of app. 2000 USD. The migrants were then transferred to a shed on the seaside near Tripoli (Italy), where they remained with several other individuals for periods ranging from few days to some months.During such periods, the migrants remained under tight surveillance of Libyan armed men. The weapons would be used against migrants in case of disobedience. Migrants were prevented from leaving or moving freely. They were very poorly fed.On 12 February 2015, the migrants were transported in a big lorry to the beach where they were made to board a rubber dinghy. A man (recognised as the suspect) - that had never been in the shed with the migrants - took over the helm and mastered the boat throughout the whole trip, showing his expertise even when the sea was turbulent.The suspect admitted to his role in the criminal plan: being a fisherman, he made himself available to the Libyan organisers of the trip to master the boat in exchange for not paying the demanded travel fee. The Libyan organisers had provided him with a campus and Thuraya satellite phone. After eight hours of navigation, the suspect called the Libyan base with the Turaya phone, who then alerted the authorities.The migrants had been warned in advance that at a certain stage, the Italian authorities would be called to their rescue, which would effectively lead to their entry into the State. Legal findings:The Court of Catania concluded for the existence of strong indicia of the suspect’s criminal responsibility in procuring the illegal entry of migrants in Italy as well as participating in the activities of the Libyan organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants.The Court considered there to be aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) the number of migrants transported (much higher than five), and (iii) the risk to the life and safety of migrants, made to travel in an inadequate and deteriorated ship, overcrowded and with no safety equipment.Against this background, the Court confirmed the remand in custody of the accused, considering that, were him to be released, there would be (a) risk of recidivism, (b) risk of escape. Yet, the Court acknowledged the prompt collaboration of the suspect with authorities, which could be relevant in determining the penalty in case of conviction.For further details, see infra “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"On 3 October 2013, a boat with migrants in provenance from Libya and directed to Sicily (Italy), capsized and killed 366 people. Only 156 people survived. The migrants were all Eritrean, with the exception of one Tunisian. The boat was clearly overloaded vis-à-vis its conditions of navigability. The survivors were sent to the reception centre of Lampedusa (Italy).On 25 October 2013, a group of migrants who had also been rescued off the coast of Italy was sent to the same reception centre. One of the new arrivals (the accused)  was aggressed by around 15 of the migrants already settled at the centre, amongst whom there were women in state of shock. The situation was controlled due to the intervention of the authorities.At least eight migrants were heard within the institute of incidente probatorio, in the presence of legal counsel and interpreters as they were heard as suspects in the contravvenzioneof illegal immigration. It resulted as follows:Some of the migrants started their trip in Eritrea, following to Ethiopia, Sudan, and Chad. They were then taken under the threat of weapons to the Sahara desert where they were prevented from leaving. The accused was the manager of the household (holding the keys of it). He carried out acts of sexual violence of the women. The same behaviour was manifested by associates of the accused. One of the women harassed and taken away did never return. Her whereabouts remained unknown.The organised criminal group requested 3300 USD to release the migrants. Those monitoring the household were armed.Once paid the ransom (usually by family members) the migrants were directed to Libya (often Tripoli) where they were delivered to another associate, who then demanded 1600 euro for the trip to Lampedusa.After approximately one month, the migrants were transported to a large boat off the coast of Libya, in which they travelled to Lampedusa and sank on 3 October 2013.Some migrants recognised the accused, once he arrived in the reception centre on 25 October.The accused was also heard, denying all the accusations and sustaining to be a smuggled migrant at the resemblance of all the others. Legal findings:The Court concludes that the accused: (i) was member of a highly structured and transnational organised criminal group based in Africa, acting with the purpose of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, and dedicated to the smuggling of migrants (amongst other crimes), (ii) directly managed an illegal detention centre in the desert of Sahara, where (together with other non-identified Somali individuals) submitted the migrants to major violence, including sexual and gender-based violence against the women, (iii) organised, together with his associates, the remaining of the trip of the migrants, notably to Tripoli.The Court further considered there to be aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) more than five people were smuggled, (iii) more than 3 people were engaged in the criminal act, (iv) the life and safety of migrants was endangered. The Court refused the application of attenuating circumstances as it saw no sign of regret nor evidence contradicting its understanding of the events. Against this background, the Court convicted the accused of criminal conspiracy for the purpose of smuggling migrants as well as procuring the illegal entry of migrants in Italy. For further details, see infra under “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"On 30 August 2013, the Air Coastal Guard detected a ship off the coat of Sicily (Italy), presumably transporting irregular migrants, and towing a smaller boat. In time, the two ships separated, with the smaller navigating towards Italy and the larger one in the opposite direction. On the morning of 31 August, la Guardia di Finanza intercepted the smaller boat, having on board 110 foreigners, all men, all Egyptians, except for one Syrian. At least five migrants were heard by the criminal police, as suspects in the contravvenzione of irregular immigration. It resulted that migrants paid between 3000 and 3500 Euro for the trip. They were taken by bus to Alessandria (Egypt) where they stayed in a house in the countryside. After some days, they were transferred to the seaside, wherefrom, in small groups, they boarded inflatables. Following a one day trip, they again transferred to a large boat that towed a smaller one. After 24 hours of navigation, the migrants were passed to this latter ship, where there were four crew men. It was there that the migrants were rescued from by Italian authorities. The larger boat left towards Egypt. During the travel, the smugglers deprived the migrants of their money, mobile phones, and other possessions, mis-treated and threatened them. From the statement of the migrants as well as another accused resulted that:the defendant had held a position of control in the smaller boat, giving instructions, making sure order was maintained, and driving it;the actual leader was on board of the larger vessel that travelled back to Egypt;both the defendant and his partners (minors) had taken such positions in exchange for not paying their “tickets” (app. 2500 Euro). Legal findings:The Court concluded for the responsibility of the defendant in procuring illegal entry into Italy through a transnational organised criminal group. The Court considered there to be aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) more than five people were smuggled, (iii) more than 3 people were engaged in the criminal act, (iv) the life and safety of migrants was endangered. The Court also refused the application of attenuating circumstances as it saw no sign of regret nor evidence contradicting its understanding of the events. Against this background, the Court convicted the defendant for procuring illegal entry into Italy through an organised criminal group. However, it absolved him of the offence of criminal conspiracy, as it could not conclude for the existence of the necessary intrinsic associative bondage rather than an occasional, non-indispensable participation in a criminal act of the organised criminal group.The accused was thus convicted of aggravated procurement of illegal entry.For further details see infra under “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"On 14 October 2014, aerial and maritime units of the Italian Navy traced a merchant ship of considerable dimensions in international waters. This ship showed no flag nor did it evidence any identifiers. The ship was located East of the coat of Sicily and apparently in direction thereto. In view of these suspicious elements, the Italian vessel exercises its right of visit under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and national law. As a result, 323 migrants in provenance from several Asian and African countries, in particular Syria, were rescued and arrived in Catania on 16 October 2016. In asserting the facts of the case, the following means of evidence were taken into account: (i) records of seizure of the ship transporting the migrants, (ii) acts of investigation regarding the flag of such ship and verification carried out by the Navy, (iii)    statement by some of the migrants,  (iv) photo identification made by the latter, (v) confession of the suspect, and (vi) circumstantial evidence. Importantly, international cooperation played a crucial role. Indeed, by cross-checking the information gathered by the Italian Navy with that available to the Turkish Coastal Guard, it was determined:The ship transporting the smuggled migrants first departed from Istanbul (Turkey) on 18 September 2014, under the name TISS (as per A.I.S. – Automatic Identification System), with six crew men, and directed to Beirut (Lebanon).On 30 September 2014, with the new name of UFC-5, it stops in Northern Cyprus for several hours to then retake its journey towards Beirut. However, the ship takes a completely different route towards Alessandria (Egypt).It stops there for several hours to then again leave, under the name of TISS, towards Sicily (Italy) .In international waters, the ship was intercepted by the Italian Navy vessel Spica, which monitored it until it realised its precarious and overcrowded condition.On 15 October, a radio emergency call is placed, whereby it is mentioned the presence of app. 300 people on board, absence of captain and crew, malfunction of the engine and consequent need of rescue.The investigation made it reasonable to conclude that during the period of mid-September to mid-October, the merchant ship was taking onboard irregular migrants from different countries with the purpose of procuring their illegal entry in Italy. For instance, the first “package” of app. 100 migrants was called “Group 1” by the organisers. This group was transported in minivan and then via inflatables to the merchant ship off shore the city of Mersin (Libya), after a trip of app 6 hours. The migrants were threatened by the organisers were they not to hold their eyes down. Once on the merchant boat, the migrants were hidden under a marquee. It was further concluded:Some of the migrants, after irregularly reaching Turkey, contacted Syrian intermediaries (several) to whom they paid app. 6000-6500 USD.When transported to the merchant ship, the crew seized the mobile phones of the migrants. However, some managed to hide them, which allowed the migrants to follow the itinerary of the trip (as supra detailed). In each stop, new large groups of migrants boarded. Some members rebelled since they started doubting they would ever arrive to Italy. In those cases, they were kept under control by armed men (Egyptian).The migrants are made aware that if there were to be any malfunction with the ship, they should call the Red Cross, of which they had the contact (the mobile phones had been returned once leaving Egypt).The crewmembers were six Syrian and a Somali. The crewmembers never mingled with the migrants except when the ship was monitored by a helicopter.The suspect was identified by migrants as the captain of the ship.  Legal findings:Against this background, the Court of Catania concluded for the existence of strong indicia of the suspect’s responsibility in procuring the illegal entry of migrants in Italy as well as taking part in a criminal conspiracy to promote the smuggling of migrants. The Court considered there to be aggravating circumstances given (i) the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) the number of migrants transported (much higher than five), (iii) the number of perpetrators (more than three) and (iv) the risk to the life and safety of migrants, made to travel in an inadequate and deteriorated ship, overcrowded and with no safety equipment, (iv) transnational character of the operations of the organised criminal group. Thus, the Court confirmed the remand in custody of the accused, considering that, were him to be released, there would be (a) risk of recidivism, (b) risk of escape, (c) risk of tempering with evidence. For further details see infra under “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"This order for precautionary detention derives from a complex investigation that followed the tragic events of 3 October 2013. Specifically, a boat with migrants in provenance from Libya (and directed to Sicily, Italy) capsized, resulting in the death of at least 366 people. As per migrant’s reports, there would have been as many as 500 people in the boat. The migrants were mostly from Eritrea. The ship was clearly overloaded vis-à-vis its conditions of navigability. The survivors were sent to the reception centre of Lampedusa (Italy).Several migrants were heard preliminarily upon their arrival to Lampedusa by the State police and, later on, by the Criminal Police and Public Prosecutor. Migrants were likewise required to proceed to photo identification of the suspects. Phone tapping and surveillance operations also took place. In addition to the above, the following chain of events was ascertained:Migrants were contacted  by (or themselves contacted) the suspect G.E., with the purpose that the latter procured their illegal entry by sea into Italy.On 25 October 2013, a group of migrants - who had also been rescued off the coast of Italy - was directed to the reception centre of Lampedusa. One of the new arrivals (M.E.M., Somali, subject to separate criminal proceedings) was aggressed by app. 15 of the migrants already settled at the centre. The situation appeared to escalate into a lynching attempt but was controlled by the prompt intervention of authorities. M.E.M. was identified as the leader of an armed group – likely composed of Somali militiamen – responsible for the kidnapping of several migrants in July 2013, in the Sahara desert, when they were in course of the journey from their home countries to Libya. Migrants were taken under the threat of weapons to a house in Sheba (Libya) where they were prevented from leaving. The group of armed men carried out several acts of aggravated violence towards the migrants. The organised criminal group requested 3300 USD to release the migrants. Relatives of the migrants paid the ransom to M.E.M.’s associates, or via Money Transfer through codes supplied by the kidnappers.The migrants were then directed in groups of app. 20-30 people to other locations, often Tripoli (Libya), where they were delivered to the suspect G.E.. In the trip from Sheba to Tripoli, migrants changed several times means of transportation. G.E. had organised in Libya a “collection camp” where up to 600 persons were held and to whom 1600 euro per person were demanded for the trip to Lampedusa.After approximately one month, the migrants were transported to a large boat off the coast of Libya, in which they travelled to Lampedusa and that sank on 3 October 2013.The suspect M.J. was identified as a high leader of this organised criminal group. Direct evidence is available on his and G.E. involvement in the preparation and organisation, with a profitable purpose, of several trips (including, and similar to, the one culminating in the tragedy of 3 October 2013), dating as early as 2006/2007. Both suspects were also in the position of instructing others, collecting and disseminating information related to the criminal activities.The participation of all suspects in organising, procuring and enabling the illegal entry, transit and or stay of migrants in Italy, for profitable purposes, was further determined in respect of a number of specific episodes/criminal acts. In this context, some of the suspects (together with individuals not yet identified) inter alia organised and or assisted the escape of migrants from the reception centres, provided logistical support (tickets, clothing, temporary accommodation) and arranged their travel to the North of Italy and or other European countries. The suspects operating in Italy to enable the illegal transit and stay of irregular migrants were paid via: (i) Western Union, (ii) direct cash delivery by relatives of migrants, (iii) post payment systems.In respect of activities aimed at procuring the illegal entry in other EU countries, circumstantial evidence points to the purchase of several plane tickets, notably with low-cost companies such as Ryanair and Easyjet. Other times, the travel would be arranged via private transportation through the suspects’ associates. Furthermore, it was asserted that the organised criminal group procured and or produced false passports as well as engaged in the practice of supplying valid passports (after being tempered, namely by changing the picture) belonging to a third party so as to allow trips out with Italy. The migrants were then required to send back the passport to the involved suspects.The organised criminal group in order to procure illegal entry and enable illegal stay in Italy, under the institute of family reunification, also resorted to sham marriages. The respective “price” would be app.7500 USD-10000 USD.The members of the organised criminal group had a structured, systematic and well-organised network of communications, resorting e.g. to satellite phones, mobile phones (generally registered under false names), Skype, Viber, Tango, and Facebook. Legal Findings:Against this background, the Public Prosecutor argued for the existence of strong evidentiary indicia on the suspects’ membership in a transnational organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants, in order to obtain a financial or other material benefit.  This organised criminal group would operate (at least) in Eritrea, Sudan, Maghreb countries and Italy. The members of the organised criminal group would also be involved in related offences (e.g. inhuman and degrading treatment as per conditions the migrants were submitted to during the crossing of the Channel of Sicily, and crimes against the public order as per production and procurement of false documents). The Public Prosecutor determined the precautionary detention of the suspects.

"On 10 September 2013, a Frontex Romanian patrol ship signalled to Italian authorities that, in international waters, a larger vessel* (so-called mother vessel) was boarding a significant number of people into a smaller vessel it had been towing. This operation took approximately 45 minutes, after which the two vessels separated. The mother-vessel turned 180º and headed back towards the Nord of Africa. The small vessel headed towards the coast of Sicily (Italy). The small vessel, given its precarious conditions, was rescued by an Italian ship of the Guardia di Finanza. The small vessel was abandoned adrift. The 199 migrants rescued arrived to the port of Siracusa (Italy) on 12 September 2013.Meanwhile, the Frontex Romanian ship had followed the mother-vessel. On 11 September 2013, the Frontex ship approached the mother-vessel to take photographs of it. It observed it masted no flag. At the request of the Frontex officials, the crew of the mother-vessel (15 men) presented identity documents in Arabic. They alleged to be fishermen. In the late afternoon, a ship of the Italian Guardia di Finanziajoined the Frontex ship and boarded the mother-vessel. The crew was arrested and the vessel was confiscated. The related investigations integrated a larger investigation (initiated in July 2013) into the actions of an organised criminal group composed of Italians and Egyptians intended to procure the illegal entry into Italy of migrants coming from certain African and Middle East countries, in exchange for financial gain. Mostly through electronic surveillance, it was possible to confirm the existence of a well-structured organised criminal group, composed of several individuals with specific tasks and access to robust resources, dedicated to facilitating the illegal entry in Italy of migrants. The criminal group carried out its criminal plan systematically and repeatedly, on the basis of the mother-vessel modus operandi as explained above. Investigations demonstrated that every crossing was monitored by the base in Egypt as well as by the support unit in Sicily (Italy) and the crew at sea. The commander of the Frontex ship and, at least, two migrants, identified the appellant as a member of the crew of the mother-vessel, who was tasked with controlling and managing the migrants. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on the outcome of searches and seizures (namely of the vessels used in the smuggling venture), testimonial evidence from migrants (at least five), documental evidence (e.g. statement of boarding carried out by the Romanian Frontex patrol ship), photo identification, interception of communications and corresponding verification diligences carried out by investigative authorities. Legal findings:In review, the Court of Catania upheld the decision of the Judge for Preliminary Investigations that determinedthe precautionary detention of the appellant, deeming there were strong indicia of responsibility for the crimes of aggravated migrant smuggling and participation in a criminal group (associazione a delinquere) dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. The Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal. For further details, see “Other background” under “Accused Persons” and and “Commentary”. --- * Note: In this analysis, the UNODC uses the term “vessel” with the meaning it entails for the purposes of the Protocol against the Smuggling by Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, that is “any type of water craft, including non- displacement craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water, except a warship, naval auxiliary or other vessel owned or operated by a Government and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service” (Article 3 (d)). Accordingly, it comprises unseaworthy ships and boats in precarious conditions.",participation in organized criminal group,1
"On 15 October 2013, the Italian Navy rescued 211 migrants (several nationalities) from international waters. On 3 November 2013, 29 migrants coming from Libya (26 Palestinians, two Syrians and one Eritrean) were also rescued in the same terms. The migrants were led to the local reception centre. Some of the migrants arrived on 15 October to the reception centre (six in particular) rebelled against one of the new arrivals, in what appeared to develop into a lynching attempt. After inquiry by the authorities, the migrants explained that the target of their rage was the defendant, who had been identified as the smuggler to whom the migrants had paid for the trip to Italy. These migrants were later heard in the context of the institute of incidente probatorio. Authorities also heard at least four of the migrants rescued on 3 November 2013. It was determined as follows:The defendant is within the higher ranks of an organised criminal group in Libya, dedicated to the smuggling of migrants into Italy. In his operations, the defendant was assisted by several men armed with machine guns. He was contacted by the migrants via telephone, upon the advice of friends or relatives. The defendant gave them instructions on the modalities of payment (app.1600-1800 USD). The migrants were kept in hiding, in a house in Sabratah (close to Tripoli, Libya), under the surveillance of armed men, who did not allow the migrants to leave even to buy food.During the stay in this house, the defendant was amongst those that went to deliver bread and water to the migrants.On the day of the trip, when migrants were to pass from the smaller boat to the larger ship, the defendant, together with armed men escorting him, deprived the migrants of all their possessions.(money, passports, mobile phones, etc).The defendant drove the boat that sank on 3 November 2013. In addition to their statements, migrants proceeded to photo identification of the defendant. The authorities were able to confirm the phone numbers referred by the migrants as pertaining to the defendant. A search was carried out into the belongings of the defendant, therefrom resulting different passports certifying identity different from the one asserted by the defendant. The records of the Coast Guard of Lampedusa (Italy) were admitted as evidence. The defendant himself was heard. The Court took into account a range of circumstantial evidence, from the deceiving manoeuvres of the defendant, emotional reaction of migrants to the arrival of the defendant in the reception centre, and items found in possession of the defendant (e.g. various communication devices). Legal findings:The Court stressed the existence of aggravating circumstances given the (i) intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit, (ii) transnational character of the operations of the organised criminal group, (iii) danger to life and safety of migrants, and (iv) inhuman treatment. The Court convicted the accused for participation in a criminal conspiracy dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and for procuring illegal entry in Italy.

"JF and JE, husband and wife, were both convicted of aggravated human trafficking and facilitating illegal entry. JF was also convicted of drug related offences.The couple, in collaboration with organised criminal groups operating transnationally, were involved in the recruitment, transportation and harbouring of two Nigerian girls (victim1 and victim2), one of whom was a minor,  in order to employ them in the Italian prostitution market and profit from them financially. The victims’ journey from Nigeria to Italy involved the crossing of Niger and Libya and was organised and paid for by the defendants. The fee for transportation ranged from 15.000,00 to 25.000,00 euros, which the girls had to pay back through their work.   The victims were repeatedly subjected to physical violence at the hands of both defendants and were constantly threatened. Before leaving Nigeria, the victims were forced to undergo a voodoo ritual. This meant they believed that if they were to escape, not repay their debt or talk to the police they would be killed, or their families would be harmed. The defendants had different roles within the criminal activity. JE took care of the recruitment of the girls, the voodoo rituals, the organisation of transport to Italy and payment to the criminal groups. She also acted as a ‘madame’, teaching the girls how to solicit customers and how much they should charge the clients. She was responsible for deflowering victim 1 with a banana and threatened the families of the victims after the police raided the house where they were staying and took them to secure accommodation.JF took care of arranging transportation of the victims to Catania and personally pick up the victims and took them to the house he shared with his wife.  He was also in charge of the ‘bookkeeping’ and annotating the respective amounts received by the girls. Based on the testimony of both victims , the evidence collected through phone call surveillance and wiretapping of the prison meetings between JF and his wife, the claims of the defendants, who argued they only rented a room to the girls and knew nothing about their prostitution, were deemed to be false. On 7.10.2019 they were both convicted to 10 years imprisonment and immediate expulsion from Italy upon completion of the sentence.",drug offences,1
"The case originates from investigations conducted by the Anti-Mafia Investigation Department of Milan which ended in October 2007. The main characters in this case, especially those charged with participation in an organized criminal group, are well know since the very first proceeding against organized crime in the north of Italy. This first proceeding, called ""Nord-Sud"" showed the existence of an organized criminal group in the north of Italy, but linked with the southern 'Ndrangheta, a criminal organization in Calabria.Many other proceedings occurred afterwards, until the so called Cerberus process which resulted in the accusation and conviction of an organized criminal group operating in the area around Milan. However, a part of this group regenerated and continued its activities with the accused convicted in the case of reference, with similar characteristics.Italian authorities kept on investigating on this very well structured criminal group which  operates in the construction industry and real estates’ brokerage, disrespectful of competition, market rules and legality.",drug offences,0
"After The Serbian Law Enforcement Agency has managed to break up two leading Mafia groups (Surcin and Zemun) other minor groups have been immediately set up linked with major international organizations.Today Serbia represents the trafficking hub of western and eastern Mafia organizations. The various international criminal organizations, among which the Russian, Chinese, Italian and Bulgarian Mafia organizations have reportedly set up “representative centres” in many cities of the Country.In Serbia there are over 30 active Mafia groups, most of them are in Belgrade.The most organized and powerful clans are in Novi Beograd, which is one of the Capital’s quarters. They are famous both for their links with other groups in the region and for their links with drug trafficking Mafia organizations in Latin America.As for drug trafficking ,strictly speaking, the region’s major Mafia groups are in the districts of Sangiaccato and Kosovo.In the last few years Serbian organized crime has widened its business over the Balkans, reaching the American Continent, Western Europe and South Africa.The strength of these groups is doubtless the organization as well as the same mentality of all members, who behave like members of a task force. Indeed, quite a number of them have been active members of special units such as “ The Arkan Tigers”, or of intelligence agencies, thus carrying over the acquired experience in adopting tactics, behavioural means and systems. That is clear when we consider the counter-measure they take to avoid shadowing, the sophisticated systems to protect their bases, the use of an arsenal more typical of commandos than of traffickers. In particular, their warrior-like mental attitude reduces the risk of making mistakes, protects the cells and enables them to react promptly in case of danger.Serbians do have, the strength, the organization, the drug-warrior mentality and the robustness of a multinational company, also thanks to the merging/reorganization between the most important criminal groups (first of all the Zenum Clan) and former army units after the armed conflicts in Former Yugoslavia.The organization’s headquarters are deep-rooted in the Balkans (Serbia and Montenegro).In the last few years an increasing number of small and large criminal organizations, both in Italy and in Europe, have decided to buy from Serbians, who buy drug overseas, transport it to Europe and deliver it “home”. The local criminal buyers deny liability for the more dangerous steps of the business.The links with Colombians cartels date back to over 20 years.The logistic organization is managed by “cells”: small groups of about ten people, who are submitted to a strict hierarchy, who can set up a base in any town, who can manage one or more cargos and then disappear or move elsewhere in case of danger. These cells, therefore, don’t “control” the territory but only run their business.Cells are submitted to a net of “managers”, who are much more mobile, who just make arrangements with buyers and supervise operations.International cocaine trafficking is carried out through supply channels managed by some cells of the organization located in Brazil, Argentine, Panama, South Africa, Canaries and Spain.Cocaine comes from South America straight to the Mediterranean, more precisely, to the Balkan Peninsula where some bases have been set up in Croatia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Bulgaria and Albania.Cocaine is smuggled into Europe mainly via sea and indeed cocaine is transported aboard merchant ships from South America.Drug is generally hidden inside containers among various goods (coffee, fruit juice, wood etc.) which are shipped trough merchant ships from:°Argentine/Brazil straight to Europe or with a stopover in South Africa;°Colombia straight to Greek.Once in Europe drug, hidden in cars’ false bottoms or in hand baggage, is sent to illegal markets.The organization supply Italy’s, Austria’s, Germany’s, Spain’s and England’s organized crime with cocaine.",drug offences,0
"This is an ethnically based transnational organized criminal group (ethnic Albanians from Kosovo). The individuals suspected of being the leaders of the Pisa-based organised crime cell were also running the various stages of the drug trafficking operations. An Albanian living in the Netherlands known by the nickname of Amor was the supplier of cocaine to the Pisa area and was also directing a network of individuals living around Rome. They were the target of an investigation which led on 6 November 2007 to the seizure of 0.446 kilos of cocaine and the arrest of an Italian citizen. The drugs were hidden in the speakers of the stereo system of the Italian’s private car.The arrest of some members of the Pisa-based cell and the seizure of that cocaine consignment caused a number of upheavals inside the organization. In order to restart the trafficking operations, the remaining drug traffickers associated with a fellow Kosovo Albanian who relocated from Lombardia to Tuscany to facilitate the cocaine trade and settled down in Asciano Pisano (in the province of Pisa) in a flat at Via del Fondo No. 21.The monitoring of his telephone conversations led to his cocaine supplier in Veneto who, in turn, was obtaining cocaine from the above-mentioned organization previously detected in the Netherlands.Further investigations revealed that a large criminal organization predominantly made up of ethnic Albanians was involved in international drug trafficking, mainly in cocaine, and had cells also in Italy: in Tuscany, Lazio, Veneto, Lombardia, Piemonte, Puglia and Emilia-Romagna.The members of this organization, who reside in different European countries, have their operational headquarters in Belgium and have connections with Norway, France, Germany, Sweden, Great Britain and Lithuania. Through this intricate network they obtain cocaine in the Netherlands and supply it to the Italian and European illegal markets.Despite the constantly changing global situation we were able to highlight the transnational dimension, the high level of specialization and the reliability gained over time on the global illegal market by this cross-border criminal organization which is ethnically based, armed, constantly expanding, flexible and highly adaptable.The criminal organization under scrutiny has a so-called “cell-based” structure and the presence of a ruling commission (cupola) to run the criminal activities ensures perfect efficiency.Cells are organised according to logical and functional criteria so that they are independent in handling and controlling drug trafficking activities in a given area, but maintain a sort of mutual interdependence while co-evolving. Membership of the same ethnic group, family or clan ties play a key aggregation role. They are very cohesive and bound by strict internal rules, generally in constant expansion and in search of new territories to control and illegal markets to encroach and they enter into agreements with criminal organisations in the country where they intend to settle in order to expand their criminal activity. They increase their economic potential by choosing among their affiliates the person that is best suited to run the business. The selection is based on managerial logic and assessment of the subject’s personal skills (for example, number of spoken languages). If one of their members is arrested, the crime group offers financial support to his family in exchange for their silence, thus ensuring their full complicity.The criminal organisation has parcelled up the territory and, consequently, this study has been divided into inferences regarding the areas controlled in Italy and those regarding the other countries involved, with particular attention being paid to operational cells based in Italy and Belgium which act as the executive core of the criminal network and are run by the bosses of the organisation.Each inference should be accompanied by information sheets about the persons involved, so as to outline the expansion potential of the criminal network in Italy and in Europe, its dynamism and operational efficiency and its connections in Italy and Europe and to reconstruct in broad terms the relationships and connections among members of the criminal group, their roles and operational methods.The transnational crime network operating in Italy is composed of ethnic Albanians and poses a serious threat for the future. Its structure draws on the typical features of Italian mafia-type organisations:- the organisational model is based on cells and on functional distribution of tasks whichensures maximum adaptability, effectiveness and efficiency;- cells are impenetrable because its members are related by close family ties which play an important aggregation role;- each cell can rely on effective logistical organisation because:• it runs its own network of couriers;• it runs carefully selected places to accommodate couriers;• it runs a network of collectors of criminal proceeds;• it has safe storage locations where to parcel cocaine and prepare vehicles to be usedby traffickers;• it has dummy names to register the cars used by traffickers and it has telephonesand SIM cards with consecutive numbers;- subdivision of the territory is guaranteed through agreements and co-evolution with local criminal groups;- drug consignments are broken down into small quantities before being distributed. Thisincreases selling time but reduces the risk of law enforcement detection and makes iteasier to move cocaine around the territory;- the same type of packaging is used (the outer wrapping of cocaine packages seized during the same investigation had the letters “T.V.T.T.” written on it).A number of Albanians at the top of the chain of command of the criminal organisationcoordinate the distribution of cocaine in Tuscany and the activities of the Albanian cells operating in the Italian provinces of Milan, Turin, Reggio Emilia and Rome.H.G., born in Albania in 1972, is one of the bosses of the Albanian organisation whoseoperational headquarters are in Belgium. He obtains cocaine from Dutch suppliers, in particular from an unknown person of African origins who uses a Dutch telephone and is believed to be the main supplier of cocaine.A.M, born in Albania in 1971 and residing in the province of Bari, acts as cocaine supplier for Albanian cells active in Italy and the boss of the criminal organisation located in Italy.There is a direct link between H.G. and A.M.: in 2007 they were checked by the Police in the Netherlands and before his disappearance, A.M. was supplying cocaine which arrived in Belgium from the Netherlands and which was then distributed to the cells operating in Italy and the UK.A.M. was directly in contact and meeting personally with the Dutch suppliers. Intercepted phone conversations revealed that the criminal syndicate used to meet in Amsterdam and cargo ships from South America were expected to arrive at the port of Rotterdam with 100 kilos of cocaine on board, part of which was to be handed to A.M..Investigations carried out so far have shown that a well-developed and organised criminal network operating in certain European countries including Italy, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Great Britain, Germany and Norway is importing cocaine from South America (Peru and Bolivia).BELGIUMThis is the operational headquarters for the importation and distribution of cocaine across Europe.The cocaine arrives in the Netherlands at the port of Rotterdam (a consignment of 100 kilos was hidden on cargo ships coming from Peru and Bolivia) and is then transported to Belgium. From Belgium it is smuggled into other European countries by couriers travelling on specially modified vehicles. Belgium is also the logistical base where meetings take place between members of the organisation and prospective buyers because here affiliates can rely on the support of owners of public premises, such as the Pizzeria “Avanti”, and hotels where couriers are lodged while waiting to take delivery of modified cars.THE NETHERLANDSSuppliers are based in the Netherlands. This has emerged from intercepted telephoneconversations and police surveillance activities. The Albanian cell based in Belgium met with several suppliers in the Netherlands. So far it has not been possible to fully identify the individuals involved.Flow of cocaine and money In the Netherlands and Belgium criminal organisations composed of ethnic Albanians store, parcel and smuggle cocaine into Italy, Germany, the UK and Norway.Couriers travel from Italy, Norway or Lithuania to Belgium where they obtain false traveldocuments and vehicles specially adapted to transport cocaine. From Belgium they drive to their destinations in these cars specially modified to conceal drugs. In Belgium the organisation furnishes accommodation to its couriers, who are waiting to take delivery of vehicles adapted for concealment purposes, in selected hotels along the transport route and provides them with travel directions and instructions for their meetings with the buyers.The leader of the criminal organisation follows the consignment over the phone to make sure that the drugs get to their destination, that contact with the buyer is established and payment effected – in some cases the cocaine is paid for upon delivery.",drug offences,0
"Our investigation originated from two alerts from the Central Directorate for Anti-Drugs Services (D.C.S.A.) forwarded to us by the General Command – II Unit. These alerts reported the seizure of a total amount of 1,900 kilos of cocaine in May 2005 and March 2006 in Martinique and Guadalupe.The drugs were found on a sailing boat and on a catamaran used by traffickers from Naples. After a careful analysis of the data provided by the Central Directorate, we formulated a number of investigative hypotheses and launched inquiries authorized by the Antimafia District Directorate (D.D.A.) of Naples and involving phone tapping. Our inquiries finally revealed the existence in Naples of a criminal organisation involved in the importation into Italy of large quantities of cocaine and hashish originating from South America and Spain. During our investigation it was also established that the criminal organisation under scrutiny was trying to smuggle huge quantities of hashish from Morocco to Spain. As the hashish was destined for the illegal market in Campania, it was to be shipped to Italy on a vessel identified by the investigating officers.After a long organisational phase necessary to fine-tune the logistical aspects of the drug trafficking operations which were constantly monitored by the investigating officers, the organisation was set to transfer the above-mentioned boat to the Spanish coasts. In order to collect detailed information about the movements of the vessel and to identify the landing port in Spain, on 31th July 2007 our Command set up a long-range ship-tracking system operated by the Operative Aeronaval Command (C.O.A.N.) of Pratica di Mare. Given the need to constantly monitor the suspects’ movements and to gather in real time any useful information about the various stages of the drug smuggling process and especially about the boat’s journey back to the Italian territorial waters once it had been loaded with drugs, with the support of the D.C.S.A. and the General Command – II Unit, our Command implemented police cooperation with the Spanish Vigilanza Aduanera. This allowed officers from the Investigative Group on Organised Crime (G.I.C.O.), with the constant support of vessels of the C.O.A.N., to carry out surveillance, close monitoring and tracking activities in Spain from 7th Aug.2007 to 29th Sept. 2009. We immediately established direct contacts with officers of the Vigilanza Aduanera in Malaga. Thanks to the constant flow of information promptly provided by the officers of our G.I.C.O. as it emerged during the inquiries, on the morning of 19 Oct. 2007 the Spanish authorities intercepted the above-mentioned vessel off the coasts of Puerto de la Duquesa (E), seized around 1,800 kilos of hashish and arrested three people, two from Naples and one Spanish citizen. The Spanish authorities were informed beforehand that a high-ranking officer and operatives from our service were deployed in the area to ensure smooth exchange of information and coordination of law enforcement activities in Spanish territory. Moreover, non-stop technical surveillance (phone tapping and bugging) allowed us to identify a villa in Castelldefels (E) with a “hidden compartment” where the organisation used to store drugs smuggled into Spain. On 2nd Nov. 2007, after the investigating judicial authority in Naples had submitted a formal request for legal assistance to its Spanish counterpart, staff from our G.I.C.O. and from the Squadra Mobile (C.I.D.) of Naples (who were inquiring simultaneously into cases of extortion committed by clan members) travelled to Castelldefels to assist officers of the local Vigilanza Aduanera during the search of the villa and contributed to the discovery of around another 860 kilos of hashish, part of which was concealed in the garage in the above-mentioned “hidden compartment” while the rest was found inside a Volkswagen Touareg car, as well as 6.9 kilos of marijuana.The investigation continued with inquiries into the finances and assets of members of the criminal organisation and their families so as to prevent the commonly used subterfuge of hiding the ‘unjustified’ availability of resources actually belonging to individuals under investigation by registering all assets and other valuables in the name of third parties. Thanks to searches in the databases available to our service and to data provided by a number of financial authorities, we carefully analysed and compared the tax returns submitted by all suspects as personal income tax payers and company tax payers with their assets and financial status as reflected by their lifestyle in order to reveal any excessive difference between living expenses and known sources of income or funds. Our analysis showed a blatant difference between assets owned and income declared, so it could be easily assumed that some of the funds available to suspects did not originate from known sources of income but were likely to be derived from drug trafficking. Based on this evidence we suggested that the investigating Judicial Authority should request the freezing of all assets available to suspects, their family members or in-laws.This request led to the issuing of a preventative seizure order under art. 321 c.c.p. for the following assets with a view to their subsequent confiscation under art. 12, clause 6, of Legislative Decree 306/92: 11 properties (including a luxury villa in Spain); 50 vehicles (cars, motorcycles, lorries and craft); 4 businesses; 25 life insurance policies; 9 bank accounts and post office accounts, with a total value of around €10 million.To this end the Italian Judicial Authority submitted a request for judicial assistance in criminal matters (under art. 15(4) of the European Convention concluded at Strasbourg on 20 April 1959) in order to obtain the seizure of property and movable assets used by the criminal organisation on Spanish soil and listed in the above-mentioned court order.The conclusion of the investigation produced the following results:• 33 individuals were reported to the Italian judicial authorities on suspicion of involvement in the offences referred to in articles 73 and 74 of Pres. Decree 309/1990 and articles 3 and 4 of Law 146/2006; three of them were caught committing the offence in Spain and arrested by Spanish law enforcement authorities;• 2,860 kilos of hashish and 6.918 kilos of marijuana, 1 boat, 5 cars, 2 motorcycles and 1 property were seized in Spain;• 8 individuals at the top of the chain of command of the criminal organisation were imprisoned pending trial under an order for pre-trial detention issued by the Judge for Preliminary Investigations (G.I.P.) of the Court of Naples.• a preventative seizure order under art. 321 c.c.p. was issued at the end of targeted financial investigations for the following assets with a view to their confiscation under art. 12, clause 6, of Legislative Decree 306/1992: 11 properties, 50 vehicles (cars, motorcycles, lorries and craft), 4 businesses, 25 life insurance policies and 9 bank accounts and post office accounts, worth a total of around €10 million.",drug offences,0
"Italian autorithies found out the existence of a transnational criminal organization, operating in several states, composed by Italian citizens and persons of African descent, who were present in Italy and other countries, dedicated to the import and the distribution in Europe and in Italy of large quantities of drugs of the type ""cocaine"" and ""heroin"", through repeated carriage, by the use of ""couriers"", from Turkey and Venezuela to Italy, as well as from Venezuela and Italy to England. Members of the organization were making ""preparatory"" trips in Venezuela and Turkey, to negotiate the price of the drug shipment to import. Cocaine was retrieved in Venezuela, while heroin came from Turkey. After that, the couriers were leaving for these countries in order to transport drugs in Europe. Once arrived in Italy, the drug was ""blended"" with other chemicals, thus reducing its purity and at the same time increasing the hazards of this substance to the ""consumers"", in order to get more profit from its sale. The blended drugs was distributed to the pushers in Naples and Latina, whence flowed in all the squares of drug dealing in the Italian territory. Another part of the drug, however, was delivered by the couriers in England, where the contact was of the organization took care of its storage and its widespread distribution; another branch of the organization was in charge of logistics: they occupied, in fact, to get the tickets for the couriers and the members of the organization who were travelling to the places where they did business with the drugs,someone else was responsible for distributing some of the profits of  drug to families of the arrested members or were used to pay lawyers.

"Organized criminal group, led by the organizer arrested in Serbia, was predominantly involved in drugs trafficking. The general modus operandi of the OCG was designed to distribute drugs through the chain of drug dealers, transfer the proceeds of crime abroad and launder money.

"The accused committed offences towards his unmarried wife and minor daughter, by using the relationship of dependency, force and threats, he recruited them for begging. He forced them to beg at various locations in Novi Sad, requiring them to obtain from 1,000 to 2,000 RSD per day. In case they would not bring enough money they were beaten, slapped, hit on the head and body by hands and other objects. Sometimes he was forcing his unmarried wife, even when she was pregnant, and was taking the money and spending it for gambling.The Court established the facts primarily from the testimony of victims themselves, who consistently described throughout the proceedings. The testimony of these witnesses was confirmed by the witness sister of the mother, who stated that she knew that the accused was beating them and forcing them to beg. They were begging for six days in the week, they were afraid of him and that is the reason why they didn’t report him.  Also, witnesses Ć.R. and B. R. stated during the proceedings that they were familiar with the fact that the mother and daughter are involved in begging.Victims were in a relation of dependency with the defendant, they were afraid of him because they were constantly beaten, and they were still afraid and very concerned of what will happen when the defendant get out of the jail. During the proceedings the mother stated that the defendant has been already subjected to criminal proceedings before, but because he had beaten her in order to change her statement, she did change it, and he was released of punishment back then. Also, during the trial, the minor victim started to cry from fear of the defendant. All the above circumstances indicate the extent of how much the victims were afraid of the defendant.The Court collected the findings and opinions of the Centre for the protection of victims of trafficking. The expert team of the Centre concluded that the mother and her daughter are victims of human trafficking, and that they were forced to beg for the defendant by the use of force and threats. Also, that all family members of the accused were victims of domestic violence, and according to the opinion of this team it is not unusual, when it comes to the victims of trafficking, that after leaving the trafficking chain, they continue with the same behaviour to which they were forced for many years, so there is a possibility that the victims continued with begging after the accused is detained. The victims were subjected to an expert examination by a psychiatrist and the Court found that the victims suffered fear caused by the defendant, which consequently caused anxiety and depression, but did not lead to permanent mental disorder.What is interesting in this case is that the defendant continued to threaten the victims from prison after he was detained, to make them change their testimony so that he could be freed of charge. During the proceedings, the accused did not deny that he was familiar with the fact that the victims were involved in begging; however he denied that they were forced to this by him. Furthermore, he confirmed in his statements that he practiced violence towards members of his family. During the proceedings, the victims didn’t claim for indemnification.",trafficking in persons,1

At the time of the exploitation both female victims were aged 17, relied on government welfare and were poorly supervised by their parents. The accused, referred to as A.R., a Serbian citizen of Albian descent, was the father-in-law of the victims’ brother. Through this relationship the accused became familiar with the victims’ economic and social situation. The accused deliberately misled one of the victims promising paid work as a maid in his home with a monthly salary of 200 Euros as compensation. Once both victims arrived at the house of the accused they were held captive by means of force and coercion. They were not allowed to leave the premises and were threatened against their will if they tried to escape – either by force or by threatening to kill the victims or their family members. One of the victims was physically assaulted and injured during the course of the exploitation. Both victims managed to eventually escape from the house they were held captive in, with one escaping separately with the daughter of the accused. The victims reported the crime to their parents in the first instance, followed by local police. The daughter of the accused also reported the crime to Croatian police and Interpol.  As a direct consequence of these events one of the victims has suffered from emotional and psychological trauma. The facts of this case were upheld by witness testimony obtained from the victims in addition to the mother and brother of the victims, the daughter of the accused who was married to the brother of the victims and police. In particular, the brother of the victims provided indirect information to police, which he obtained from his wife - the daughter of the accused, about critical events pertaining to the crimes of the accused in this case. The daughter of the accused was staying in the house of the accused during the relevant period and was able to verify the victims’ testimonies.    The accused was  initially sentenced to two counts of human trafficking under Article 388, paragraph 3 in conjunction with paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, for 5 years imprisonment.

The defendant kept the money for herself, and when the victim began to ask the defendant not to force her anymore to prostitution by crying, the accused kept forcing her to continue with prostitution by threatening to harm her and her mother, as well as by use of force -pulling her hair, kicking her, limiting her freedom of movement, etc.The Court established the facts primarily based on the testimony of victim who consistently described throughout the proceedings how she was recruited by the defendant to start with the prostitution, and how the accused was taking her to the place where she was offering sexual services to customers for a predetermined fee agreed by the defendant, who took all the money for herself. She also described how the defendant continued forcing her to prostitution by using threats and force. The testimony of the witness D.V. given before the police authorities, who has been in an emotional relationship with the defendant, coincides in details with the testimony of the victim, regarding the stay of the victim in his apartment where she was providing sexual services to the customers. However, this witness changed his testimony later at the trial by stating that he had no information on whether the victim was engaged in prostitution. But the Court didn’t accept this altered testimony, finding that the witness wanted to help the accused with whom he was in an emotional relationship.Method of detection of criminal offence and perpetrators – The mother of the victim noticed that her daughter was behaving strange and after some people drew her attention about her daughter being involved in prostitution and when the victim didn’t show up for a few days, she decided to include the police by reporting that her underage daughter disappeared, after which the police found the victim and returned her to her mother.",trafficking in persons,1

On this occasion, the first defendant imposed her debt of 18,000 RSD for narcotic drugs, telling her that in order to settle the debt she has to provide sexual services for customers he gets. On the other hand, another minor victim (Victim 2) warned her that the first defendant holds prostitutes, and that she should listen to him, to avoid being beaten. When Victim 1 refused, S.J used physical force - he slapped her and frightened her, therefore she agreed to provide sexual services and did that for nine days.In relation to a criminal offence committed against a minor (Victim 2), S.J. abused her serious economic and social conditions and recruited her for prostitution, by initiating an emotional relationship with her, and moved her to his house and asked her to provide sexual services, which she accepted, and was doing that for a period of four months, and she was giving him all the money she earned.All the money that both minor victims earned by offering sexual services, they gave to the first defendant (S.J.).The Court established the facts based on the testimony of Victim 1, who consistently described throughout the proceedings how she was recruited by the second defendant (V.M.) to go to the house of the first defendant, where he kept her for nine days by using threats and physical force, asking her to provide sexual services to customers he gets in order to pay him back an alleged debt of 18,000 RSD. Also, she explained how the other minor, Victim 2, recruited her as well for prostitution for the account of the first defendant, something that he approved by his own statement.During the proceedings, the Victim 2 was changing her testimony, so the Court did not accept the statement that she gave in previous proceedings, estimating that by such statement she wanted to protect the first defendant with whom she was involved in an emotional relationship. However, the Court accepted her testimony given at the main trial, where she explained how she was dealing with prostitution while was living together with the first defendant and giving all the earned money to him. During the proceedings, according to the psychiatrist, the Court established that both minor victims were capable of providing truthful testimony.Victim 1 was instructed to achieve the stated indemnification claims against the first defendant in the civil proceedings, while Victim 2 did not raise a claim for indemnification.Method of detection of criminal offence and perpetrators - After nine days of keeping Victim 1 in his house, S.J. let her return to the Children's Village. She then reported the whole case to the police, while the Victim 2 stayed in the house where she was living with the first defendant, until his detention.",trafficking in persons,1
"Defendants 1 and 2 – R.J. and R.S. – were a married couple who resided in Milan at the time the crime was committed, and were unreachable at the time the trial was conducted. They had both been previously convicted of several offences other than human trafficking. The third defendant, J.J., was R.J.’s cousin, and he was was charged with acting together with R.J., R.S., and others,  recruiting the victim through deception, threatening the victim with the use of force, and hiding his identity documents. J.J. was accused of having recruited the victim, he allegedly talked with the victim on the telephone on October 10, 2011 and then met him in person. The victim claimed that the defendant had recruited him through deception, by offering to find him a grapes-picking job in Switzerland. The defendant allegedly deceived the victim with a sham job offer of a well-paid job, offering a monthly salary of 1.500 € and including free accommodation, conditions which lead the victim to accept the offer. According to the victim, the defendant then accompanied him to take a bus to Italy, where he would supposedly meet the whole group of grape-pickers. Instead the victim was met by R.J. when he reached Milan..R.J. picked up the victim in Milan and took him to a rented apartment first, and then to a Roma community camp in the suburbs, where R.J. and R.S., together with a few unknown persons, repeatedly tried to persuade the victim to commit acts of larceny for their profit. The victim refused to engage in this criminal activity, and as a consequence, he was beaten by those unknown persons, after which R.S. gave the order to lock him up in a shack, where he spent ten days. In the meantime, R.S., R.J., and others threatened to kill him unless he accepted their proposal to commit criminal acts in their benefit. In addition, R.J. threatened him with a gun. Moreover, R.J and R.S. had previously taken away I.D.’s personal documents.Under the aforementioned circumstances, the victim, I.D., was forced to submit and engage in criminal acts, and therefore he committed thievery in Milan a few times with R.J., R.S. and other members of their group. On December 2, 2011, the victim was arrested by the Italian police together with a couple of other members of the group. They were released shortly after, and two days later, on December 4, I.D. managed to escape and to seek assistance at the police station in Milan with the help of his girlfriend from Serbia, who he contacted through the internet, as he did not speak neither Italian nor English. The police then sent him to the Serbian Consulate in Milan, where he was provided with new travel documents. The victim was then able to leave Italy, and returned to Serbia. The victim was able to testify and to attend the trial.",trafficking in persons,1
"The defendant took advantage of the hardship experienced by victim 1, the fact that she was unemployed without any means of making a living, pregnant and that she and her boyfriend did not have a place to stay, in order to recruit her to offer sexual services in his and his underage son’s benefit. After the victim accepted the defendant’s offer to work for him engaging in prostitution, he started driving her to the area known as “Kaćka petlja” every night at around 8pm to prostitute. He would then park his car nearby and control the victim, the number of customers she had, and the amount of money she earned. The victim charged from 1,000 to 2,000 per service, and she  was making around 11,000-12,000 dinars per night, all of which she had to give to the defendant. The defendant would then drive her back to his house and did not allow the victim to go out during the day, with the exception of one occasion, in which he made the victim walk to “Kaćka petlja” at around 1pm, provide sexual services for some three hours, and earn an additional 5,000-6,000 dinars for the accused.Even though the victim was pregnant, the defendant forced her to continue providing sexual services until a few days before childbirth. As her boyfriend abandoned her a month before she gave birth, the accused picked her up from the hospital and made the victim continue providing sexual services only 4-5 days after she had the baby. The wife of the accused took care of the baby in the meantime. The defendant abused the victim’s position of vulnerability after she gave birth to her baby, as she was alone with no means to support herself and the baby. In addition, he took away her ID, hid it, and started beating her together with his underage son.In 2008, the defendant demanded from the victim that she find another girl to provide sexual services for his benefit because he wasn’t satisfied with the profits she was making for him. The first victim met a 15 year old girl, victim 2 at a train station. She had escaped from a Children’s Village and had no family or place to go. Anonymous victim 1 took the other victim to the defendant’s house, where he, together with his son, recruited her as well and convinced her to engage in sexual services for their benefit. The defendant then drove victim 2 to “Kaćka petlja” together with victim 1 every night to prostitute from 8pm until 2 am, taking away all the money she made, which was usually 10,000-15,000 dinars. The two victims were not allowed to leave the defendant’s house except for the hours they were  working in the streets, and they were often beaten by the defendant and his son. On the 1st of October 2008, the two victims took the first victim’s baby when everybody was sleeping and escaped, taking a train to Subotica.",trafficking in persons,1
"In March 2009, the two defendants recruited an underage victim and provided her with accommodation and transportation from their house to the so-called “Kaćka petlja” where she engaged in commercial sex acts for the defendants' benefit every day, during six days. The defendants had three kids together, and lived together in an extramarital union in Čenej.The Victim was a 15 or 16 year old girl who had been living with their son -and by extension with the defendants- in the family home for the past eight months. During that period, the victim had been engaging in prostitution, and when the defendants’ son found out about it, he got into a fight with the victim, threw her out of the house, and brought a new girl in to live with him. The victim spent the night with a friend, but defendant 1 visited her the following day and suggested that she come back to the house and sleep, not in their son’s room, but in his and defendant 2’s room, and that she continue prostituting for them in exchange for accommodation, clean clothes and food. The victim accepted and moved back into defendants’ house.The deal obliged her to give 5,000 dinars to the defendants every night, and she could keep the remaining earnings, if any, for herself. Every day, during those critical six days during which the victim prostituted herself for the defendants’ benefit, the defendants drove the victim in their red car from their house to the “Kaćka petlja” area around 18.00, left her to prostitute, and went back to pick her up and collect the money around midnight. The defendants were arrested on the night of March 6, when they went to pick the victim up at “Kaćka petlja”. They had previously taken 5,000 dinars from her, which were found in defendant 2’s possession.",trafficking in persons,1
"In the course of four months -from May to August 2009- four defendants recruited two victims through deception and attempted to recruit two other victims. The defendants abused the victims’ trust deceiving them in order to recruit them, and subsequently transferred and harboured the victims with the purpose of sexually exploiting them, and using threats of the use of force against them and their families to gain control over the victims.According to her own testimony, defendant 2  had been engaging in prostitution for twenty years. Defendant 2, together with Defendant 4, deceived two adult females through sham job offers of well-paid jobs abroad – such as picking fruits and vegetables, domestic work, etc. Defendant 4 was a restaurant owner, and she received 1,000 Euros from defendant 2 for assisting her with the recruitment of the victims. Defendant 4 referred the victims, who were her former employees, to defendant 2; but she did not act in a coordinated manner with the other defendants, and in fact she only knew defendant 2.After being introduced to the two victims, defendant 2 and defendant 1 -who claimed to be defendant 2’s husband, and who was involved in a romantic relationship with her- took them to the town of Subotica for the final arrangements before the trip. There, defendant 3 was given 5,000 Euros to provide the victims and defendant 2 with false IDs and passports of the Republic of Slovenia and the Republic of Slovakia.Defendant 2 crossed the international borders from Serbia to Italy illegally, together with the victims. Victims and defendant crossed the Bosnian and Croatian borders through the woods, and the Slovenian border by boat. Defendant 1 -who is a national of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovakia- simply drove to Italy in his van. Once in Italy, the victims realized that they were not going to pick fruits or work in domestic work as promised, but that the defendants required them to provide sexual services. The victims did not want to engage in prostitution, but felt like they had no other choice, since they did not have any money or documents, they did not speak Italian and they were under threats of use of force by defendants 1 and 2. Defendant 2 told the victims that she would allow them to leave once they had earned 8,000 euro each, to pay back for the money spent on their documents and transportation. Defendant 2 would then give the money earned by the victims to Defendant 1, who also followed and monitored the victims’ work from his camper van.The victims worked on highways close to major cities in Italy, using forged Slovenian and Slovak passports and IDs. Both of them had to earn at least a daily quota amounting to 700-800 Euros in the beginning and 1,000 Euros afterwards. Defendant 1 determined the prices for victims’ services as follows: 30 euro for oral sex, 40 euro for both oral and classic sex, 100-150 euro for anal sex. The victims were forced to work 10-12 hours every day, as defendant 1 threatened to beat them and kill their families if they did not meet the quota. Every time the Italian Police took away the victims´s and defendant 2´s documents, defendant 2 would contact defendant 3, who came up with new forged documents.The victims were forced to work from May to July 31, 2009, when they managed to escape and go to Batrovci, Croatia. After that, the two victims were transferred to Serbia by the Croatian authorities, and accommodated in a safe house as human trafficking victims.Defendant 2 stayed in Italy and kept providing sexual services until August 2009 when she went back to Serbia and met with Defendant 4 again in order to recruit another two women, witnesses 3 and 4. This time, Defendant 2 openly told the women that they would be offering sexual services in Italy. One of them accepted the offer, but later changed her mind.",trafficking in persons,1
"The accused A.N. in the state of accountability, as a person with dominant position within the organized criminal group, together with accused P.B. made an operation plan in order to enable illegal stay, transit and illegal crossing of the border with Hungary for migrants, with the purpose to obtain a material gain in the amount up to 1200 euros per person.  The organizers (A.N. and P.B.) and the members of the organized criminal group (Z.S.,B.S., Z.P, .R.J, D.P, M.C, NN A., and other persons)  shared among themselves the material gain, based on their individual role in accomplishing illegal crossing of migrants  from Serbia to territory of Hungary (for each individual case). For the organizers, the predicted amount was between 300 and 400 euros, while the other members of organized criminal group took between 50 and 80 euros. The accused A.N. managed direct contacts with other members of organized criminal group with the purpose to organize illegal transit from Belgrade to Subotica (within territory of the Serbia), as well as illegal crossing of the border with Hungary and illegal transit trough Hungary to Vienna. In the period between 3.1.2016 and 29.2-2016, A.N. obtained not less than 5000 euros and enabled illegal transit and illegal crossing of the state border with Hungary for 73 migrants. In establishing the fact, authorities relied much on surveillance techniques, testimonial evidence (notably declarations of smuggled migrants and defendants) and reports and information gathered from other public institutions such as Ministry of Finance/ Administration for the Prevention of Money Laundering.Authorities were able to confirm at least 5 migrant smuggling cases in which accused A.N. participated:-       On 16.1.2016. A.N. and accused P.B organized smuggling of 6 persons-from Belgrade to Vienna. Previously, accused Z.S. hired a person to find vehicles and drivers for transportation from Belgrade to Subotica.

"Organized criminal group, led by the organizer arrested in Serbia, was predominantly involved in drugs trafficking. The general modus operandi of the OCG was designed to distribute drugs through the chain of drug dealers, transfer the proceeds of crime abroad and launder money. The organizer of the OCG, Serbian citizen, was performing his activities, managing the whole OCG business from territory of Republic of Serbia, but no drugs was seized in the territory of Serbia. The chain of drugs trafficking consisted of branches connected to cities where drugs were transferred by ship or plane transportation such as: Amsterdam (The Netherlands), Antwerp (Belgium), Ravenna and Venice (Italy), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Santos (Brazil), Podgorica (Montenegro), Durban (South Africa), Malmö (Sweden), etc.The mayor role of the OCG and its activities, managed by the leader was to distribute drugs (cocaine) in Europe and other destinations in the world. For the purpose of its criminal activity the OCG engaged mostly members of Serbian origin, but also others originating from various countries.While committing criminal offences the OCG had assistance of other criminal groups, using secret means of communication, special language and code names for items and places, secretly gathering and meeting with other members of the group. Delivery of cocaine was mostly made in sea ports, but also using airports, hidden places or border crossing. The organizer also used and very much relied on his former connection and friendship with some of the members of the group. They have functioned through regular contacts and co-ordination in order to transfer drugs safely to their customers, and to bring back “dirty” money.

"The defendant, Ms X, was involved in the receiving of 39 women from Thailand, whom she obtained from a recruiter operating in Thailand.  This recruiter sent photos and other personal details of the trafficked women to Ms X in advance, who the selected the women for work in her ‘salons’ which she operated in multiple locations across Switzerland.  She deliberately chose women from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds because of their greater vulnerability and their (perceived) inability to resist and refuse the demands of Ms X.Upon arrival into Switzerland, Ms X confiscated the women’s passport and their return airline tickets which she kept ‘as a security’.  She also charged each woman a ‘debt’ of approximately CHF 12,000 for the expenses relating to their travel and entry into Switzerland.  She further threatened the women with a penalty of CHF 10,000 if the women tried to leave her before fully discharging their debt or if they chose to work less than the required hours.The women were forced to work in Ms X ‘salons’ (which appear to involve adult entertainment establishments as well as brothels) for 17 hours a day.  Any money received by the victims from clients were taken away by Ms X, and 40 percent of their earnings were discounted from the inflated debt created by Ms X.  Any food, clothing and other supplied required by the victims were charged to their debt.The women’s movements and activities in the ‘salons’ were closely monitored and electronic monitoring devices had been installed by Ms X for that purpose.  Ms X controlled the fees charged and payments made, and, on at least one occasion, forced one of the victims to work during menstruation.  The women were not permitted to make any external phone calls or have any communication with persons outside Ms X’s sphere.On several occasions, Ms X ‘lent’ some of the women to other brothels which were connected to (and under the control of) the defendant.  She later also sold individual women to Swiss men for a fee of CHF 57,000 though it appears that CHF 30,000 of that amount was to be returned to the men while the women had to work to pay off the full amount.The court found that Ms X was clearly in a position of power and control over the women; a position which she created and exploited.  She exercised financial and social pressure and took full advantage of the women’s illegal status in Switzerland, their inability to speak German, and their social isolation.  The situation created by Ms X made in unnecessary for her to keep the women locked away or physically restrict their movements, as they were forced and threatened to work extreme hours in order to discharge their debts.",other crimes,1

On 22 June 2017, the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration, which was responsible for examining his asylum application, did not enter into his asylum application and ruled that he must be transferred to Italy in accordance to the Dublin regulation. From 7 July 2017, the Afghan national had been treated in a mental healthcare institution for posttraumatic stress and depressive disorder. As he did not return to his allocated accommodation, his transfer to Italy could not be executed and had to be rescheduled. Eventually, he was arrested on 22 January 2018 in Basel and was then transferred to Italy on 21 February 2018.The accused attempted to assist the Afghan national by transporting him across the Swiss-Italian border, knowing that he did not have legal documents to enter Switzerland legally.

"Subject to the proceedings is a Romanian couple, A.A. and B.A., who owned and operated a bus company which regularly transported Romanian nationals, usually of Roma origin, from Aiud (Romania) to Geneva (Switzerland). Knowing that their customers came from poor communities, the couple would regularly advance the transportation fee of 120 Euros. Once in Switzerland, the defendant A.A. would be in charge of exercising pressure to the migrants to pay back the debt owned to them, often threatening the physical integrity of the migrants. Initially charged with aggravated human trafficking, threats and profiteering, the Criminal Court of Appeal of the Republic and Canton of Geneva later acquitted the defendants on these charges only finding a conviction for attempted coercion and facilitation of unlawful entry and stay in Switzerland. The prosecution argued that the defendants knew that the migrants did not have sufficient financial assets to stay in Switzerland and could therefore not rely on the right to enter and stay there accorded to EU nationals in the EU-Swiss Free Movement Agreement. In addition, defendants knew that transported migrants wanted to work in prostitution, do minor criminal acts (such as thefts and burglaries), and wanted to beg for money, which according o Genevan law is prosecuted with a fine. Due to their intended criminal activity, migrants could not rely on their right to enter and stay in Switzerland which in consequence means the defendant facilitated an illegal entry and stay for financial gain.

The Judge, however, considered there had been an erroneous legal qualification of the facts. In her view, the defendant should have been charged with migrant smuggling rather than aggravated embezzlement. She added that by advertising on the newspaper work in, and visas for, the United States, the defendant did not only engage in a deceptive behavior, but rather incentivized the exit of Colombian nationals from the country (and their entry in another country) without fulfilling the necessary requisites.

"By virtue of an inquiry carried out by the Prossecutor Office in Colombia, it was possible to determine the existence of a criminal organization in the city of Bogotá dedicated to promoting the irregular departure of Colombians to the United States and the European Union in exchange for an economic benefit. This activity was carried out by providing migrants with false personal information and travel documents so that they could access visas without complying with the requirements established for that purpose and after that trip and enter the territories in question. ACCUSED 1 as a fundamental part of this organization facilitated and promoted this criminal activity by providing those documents in which he realized that his clients were linked to an apparently fictitious company of which he was the owner and that they were preparing to travel in order to receive training or participate in thematic festivals related to the purpose of the company.",smuggling of migrants,1
"In 2011, the U.S. Embassy received information indicating that ACCUSED 1 was fraudulently offering U.S. visa application services. After the investigation, it was discovered that it provided false documentation to the victims for the creation of socioeconomic profiles that would allow them to obtain a visa to travel irregularly from Colombia to the United States. In the past four years he has helped more than 200 people leave Colombia to the United States.  It is for this reason that he created fraudulent economic profiles and informed the migrants that he had a friend working in Bancolombia (Colombian bank), who filled out the forms and a notary friend who would produce the certificate, thus earning economic profits of up to $6,000,000 COP (approx. $2,000 USD).

Then Maria delivers the victim L to a man and a woman who were people in charge of conducting surveillance on the victims of trafficking within the organization. The victims do not receive money because it is received through the administrators that the organization has.After the permission to work in Hon Kong expired, Maria proceeded to take her out of the country to the Philippines to continue the work. The victim L is not granted permission to travel to another country and is questioned by immigration authorities about the investigation of a trafficking network.

Similarly, the other two victims were recruited by this person, and were later transported and harboured in Curazao in June 2008.The victims had been instructed about the responses they should give to the questions posed by the Embassy staff. They had to reply that the reason why they were applying for a visa was that they wanted to work as dancers in Curazao. However, some of the victims knew that they would be engaging in prostitution in that country.Ms Nora Liliam López was the person in charge of recruiting the victims and introducing them to the co-defendant, Lida Marcela. The latter was responisble of dealing with all the formalities in order to obtain the tickets, passports and visas, as well as transporting the victims to Curazao, where they were sexually exploited at an establishment known as “Rice Café”, owned by her partner, Mr. R.W.The victims were exploited under the pretence of a 3-month long employment contract as dancers. The prosecution was able to establish the relationship between R.W. and defendant Lida Marcela, through records which showed the transfer and receipt of money between this man and Lida Marcela.Once the victims had been received and harboured in Curazao, R.W. and Lida Marcela obtained financial gain from their sexual exploitation in inhumane conditions. Once in Curazao, they removed the victims’ documentation, and acting as the manager of the establishment where the victims were held, Lida Marcela informed the victims of the debt they had incurred, and which they had to repay by engaging in prostitution. The victims had to buy their own food, pay the fines which were routinely imposed upon them, as well as pay the room in which they lived in groups of approximately 8 women.

"The events took place between March and June 2011. Back then, A.M.A.O. and L.C.P.P. were contacted via Facebook by Ms S.A.V.J. This woman persuaded the victims to travel to China under the pretence of transporting goods at a low cost, in order to resell them at a higher price in the national territory. The victims were deceived. They were told that they would be lent the money to pay for the airplane tickets and that they would have to repay this money after their arrival in China. This was the only debt that was mentioned to them before taking the trip. However, once in China the victims only had one day of rest, and on the following day they were told that they had to engage in prostitution in order to repay a debt of 45.000.000 COP$ they had contracted as a result of the expenses incurred to obtain their airplane tickets, transportation and other documents. Hence, the victims were taken to a nightclub named ‘Kama’ and a street named ‘Jenssi Lu Ma Lu’, where they offered their sexual services to foreigners. The money obtained from that activity was witheld by their captors in compensation for the aforementioned debt.One month later, the victims managed to escape and reached the airport.

Hence, the victim got in touch with Javier Londoño, who was a hairdresser and lived near the bar. He told the victim that a woman from Ecuador was interested in hiring young women to work in that country under excellent conditions and pay. The victim was told that the costs of obtaining the documents and tickets to travel to Ecuador would be covered by the employer. Thus, the victim agreed to travel together with three other women, and travelled by land to Ipiales. The tickets for this trip were purchased by a woman named Patricia, who also covered the costs of the food and hotel for the four women. This woman also procured documents such as criminal record, photographs, and the Andina card. From there, the victims traveled to Tulcán and from there to Ibarra. Upon the victim's arrival at the bar, the owner of the bar, a.k.a. Mónica, told the victim that she would be working as a prostitute.

Similarly, the victims were told about the various rules they had to follow, and of the fines they would have to pay if they disobeyed or broke the rules. The victims were transported in cars owned by the organization to a bar where they had to engage in prostitution from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. without rest.In the case of L.Y.H.V and J.A.S.G., these victims exited this exploitative situation because they were “bought out” by clients who paid the remaining of their debt.

Whenever a client demanded a prostitute, the recruiter could send him girls from “his network” as well as girls recruited by other members of the organization. Afterwards, the victim and the recruiter made a financial agreement on how they would split the splits, which was usually made in the ratio of 50% for each.The organization ran a criminal operation in international trafficking in persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation and M.J.S.B. was J.A.O.’s person of trust in Europe. She lived in Portugal and managed the victims across that continent. An intercepted phone call made between the respondents revealed that they were discussing J.A.O.’s intention of sending some women to Arabic Countries once the Ramadan would be finished.",other crimes,1
"The defendant Maria de Jesus dos Santos Bezerra was an integrant of an organized criminal group with the purpose of promoting, intermediating and favouring the internal and international trafficking in person, participating directly on the profits from the prostitution of the women recruited.The evidence gathered showed that Jiselda Aparecida de Oliveira, aka Gigi, had a database with photos of naked women or women wearing sensual underwear. The photos were sent by email to clients searching for her services along with a code that gives access to the photos. According to the Federal Police reports of telephone interceptions, Gigi received several calls per day of Brazilian and foreigner clients, who sought women for sexual programs in Brazil and abroad.The defendant Maria de Jesus lives in Portugal and is responsible for the agency of the women that Gigi sends to Europe.",other crimes,1
"In 2004, a woman informed the Brazilian Police that her daughter was being forcibly kept in a nightclub in Natal.The police investigations confirmed that a criminal organization, composed of G.A. and several other persons, operated numerous nightclubs in Natal and one in Seville, Spain. The establishments were owned by G.A. and used as brothels. G.A.’s passport indicated that he was a leader of the criminal group as he travelled extensively between the locations of the nightclubs between 2004 and the day of his arrest. It was also revealed that G.A.was a member of an Italian mafia involved in drugs trafficking and trafficking in persons for sexual exploitation in Italy. In Italy, G.A. already had an extensive criminal record.It was proved that the criminal organization recruited women and sent them to work in G.A.’s nightclubs in Natal. One victim testified that she originally thought she would go to Spain to work as a prostitute. She was told by the defendants that, prior to leaving to Spain, she had to pass an “internship” in a nightclub in Natal. Once in Natal, she worked as a prostitute with all her profits going directly to the defendants. Several women testified that the defendants often threatened to kill them if they tried to escape or go to the police. One of the women testified that she overheard a conversation between two cuadrilha members who were discussing that the women’s passports would be retained until their travel expenses to Natal and Seville were covered by the women’s earnings.The nightclubs had private rooms where the girls had sexual intercourse with clients. The rooms were equipped with cameras to control the women. The women had a strict schedule they were requested to adhere to regarding when to arrive and leave, and how to charge the customers. If they did not obey these rules, they would be fined or prohibited from going to any other places owned by the defendants.Evidence showed that the criminal group had received a lot of money in foreign currency and conducted many illegal transactions. According to the investigations, a share of the money was received legally through financial entities to prove the group’s investment in Brazil (the defendants were granted permanent visa for “individual foreign investors” which required a minimum investment of USD 50,000). A larger share of the money was transferred in dubious cash transactions, later considered by the Public Ministry as money laundering and the crimes against the national financial system.",other crimes,1
"In November 2004, a Mobile Inspection Unit visited the Fazenda Boa-Fe Caru and found 19 workers, including a 16 year-old boy, in slave-like conditions. Most of the workers were illiterate. Labour inspectors testified that the conditions they observed in that fazenda were among the worst they had ever seen. Workers had no access to drinking water, no sanitation, inadequate accommodation, no safety equipment and no first aid kit. They were living in shelters of canvas or straw, without walls or floor, which did not protect them efficiently from the rain. Their work papers were not signed and, at the time of the inspection, some workers had not received any salary for 5 months. They were working from dawn till dusk, without the right to rest on Sundays. If they did not work, their hours would be deducted at double the daily rate.Workers incurred an initial debt towards the employer when recruited. The debt was then artificially maintained, because they had to pay for their transport to the farm and, subsequently, buy everything (garments, food, medicines and even working tools) in the estate shop, at prices far above those of the market.Workers were prohibited from leaving the farm, and were regularly threatened to discourage them from attempting to do so. Escape was made all the more difficult by the extremely isolated position of the farm, which was about 220 kilometres from the nearest city. This distance constituted an unquestionable obstacle to the freedom of movement of the workers, who were entirely subject to the will of the defendant. Combined with the fear factor, the distance involved cancelled in practice any possibility of escape. Nor could they ask for help, because they did not have the right to send or receive letters.[Note: This is a direct extract from ‘International Labour Office, Fighting Forced Labour: The Example of Brazil (2009), 24-25’]",other crimes,1

There is no evidence that the defendants were engaged in any legal activity. The Court ruled the Habeas Corpus as inappropriate and denied the request for the suspension of provisional execution of the sentence.The court noted that the transfer to Natal prison had already been requested and obtained before. Moreover, for the moment there are no vacancies and placing additional Italian prisoners from the “Corona Operation” in the provisional prison would constitute a threat to public safetyThe court stated that provisional release may not apply to the criminal offenses in consideration, reminding that the United Nations called for all Member States to engage against these crimes. Furthermore, the defendants could make use of their provisional release to escape to their country of origin. As a standard for public safety, the court unanimously refused the habeas corpus.",other crimes,1

The victims were under constant control of the organization.The judge, in agreement with the Federal Public Prosecutor, stated that the habeas corpus may not be used as a judicial appeal to reconsider the evidence and convictions.

The Federal Police report and intercepted phone calls demonstrated that J.A.O. was receiving daily calls from Brazilian and foreign clients looking for sexual intercourse with the girls in Brazil and abroad.Because of the success of the business, the defendant relied on various recruiters. Each of them had a network of clients and prostitutes, but there was no formal commitment between them, only an association based on “trust and empathy”. When one of the recruiters needed to send a girl to a client, he resorted to his photo book and organized castings with the prostitutes of other recruiters’ networks. Later, an agreement was made between the recruiter and the prostitute, usually in the ratio of 50% profit each.It was proven that the defendant recruited women and sent them abroad to practice sexual activities. The complaint mentioned a woman named L.C.M., who was sent to Europe with one of J.A.O.’s clients.

Additionally, a preview image, that could also be seen when retrieving the thread, had been uploaded to a separate image hosting service. The password necessary for decryption of the material was also made available in the thread. The users could further add additional footage via postings. Therefore, one thread contained multiple files of illegal material. In order to ensure permanent access, the footage was shared on two separate file hosting service. The material available via threads was not only accessible to registered members but also an unclear number of non-registered users. Further material was made available by members via links in the websites’ chat, which was not publicly accessible. The chat facilitated initial contact between members to share views on posted material and child abuse. The conversation was often continued on other platforms and sometimes led to in person meetings between users.The images and videos accessible to members of both forums including the chat rooms mostly contained videos with the following content: mutual oral and vaginal intercourse between children; mutual oral vaginal or anal intercourse between children and adults; insertion of items into the genitals or anuses of children; ejaculation in the face, mouth or on the body of children; close-ups of the genitals of children; children in sexually suggestive poses; and mutual masturbation of children.The defendants operated the following forums and chats containing such material:- THE GIFTBOX EXCHANGE-FORUM from July 2015 until November 2016;- THE GIFTBOX EXCHANGE-INTERNATIONAL-CHAT from August 2015 until November 2016;- THE GIFTBOX EXCHANGE-TINY-LOVERS-CHAT from February until November 2016;- ELYSIUM-FORUM from December 2016 until June 2017;- ELYSIUM-GIRL-LOVERS-CHAT from December 2016 until June 2017;- ELYSIUM-TINY-LOVERS-CHAT from December 2016 until June 2017.Defendant four, who registered on 22 July 2015, helped create and manage THE GIFTBOX EXCHANGE (hereinafter referred to as TGE). Access to TGE required that a user register an account. In order to activate the account, the prospective user had to upload child sexual abuse material in order to minimize the risk of undercover law enforcement agents accessing the site. Likewise, users had to publish child sexual abuse material at least once a month to have complete access to all the content on the forum. The platform TGE had a strict hierarchical structure. There were four admins (including the fourth defendant) each operating under their own accounts as well as the “official” TGE account. The admins, with full access to the boards, undertook administration and maintenance tasks to guarantee the faultless operation on a technical and content-related level. Additionally, ten moderators supported the admins. Members that had risen to the ranks of admin or moderator had an additional monthly responsibility to post child sexual abuse material to further verify their motivation. On 4 October 2016, a total of 67,160 users were registered on the platform (including the admins and moderators). The TGE chat rooms, likewise, had a hierarchical structure comparable to the forum. The fourth defendant was responsible for programming the chat rooms, the recruitment of new members, the allocation of accounts, as well as informing members of the forum rules and maintaining the TGE servers.The third defendant joined the TGE forum on 31 July 2015 and assumed the role of moderator in the TGE-INTERNATIONAL-CHAT. He was responsible of checking the compliance with platform rules and block users where necessary. In December 2015, defendant four nominated defendant three for the position of leading chat moderator, which defendant three held at the latest from 10 February 2016 onwards. Defendant four also offered defendant three the position of chat admin of the TGE-TINY-LOVERS-CHAT once the chat went online, a position defendant three held at the latest from 1 March 2016 onwards. Defendant three took over all matters regarding the chat rooms including, inter alia, the recruitment of chat personnel and the point of contact for staff members. He further created the seasonally changing background graphics of the chat rooms. Likewise, he undertook tasks in relation to the forum, including the translation of the rules into German.The first defendant registered for the forum on 15 June 2016. Shortly after, he registered for the chat rooms. He was nominated for chat moderator by the fourth defendant and held the position from mid-September 2016 onwards at the latest. He was responsible of user support and supervision as well as the supervision of the chat rooms themselves, mainly with relation to compliance with the rules. In addition, he worked on testing new chat scripts together with the fourth defendant, proposed various functions and reported several faults. Since October 2016, he further translated the security instructions of the forum into German.The second defendant became a registered user by 31 July 2016 at the latest. It was noted that he was a “registeredplus-member”. This type of member could exercise moderator functions if no other staff member was online. Accordingly, he could issue warnings and block users if necessary. Furthermore, he also worked on testing the chat scripts and translating the instructions by proofreading the translation created by defendant one.As part of the posting and verification duty, defendants one, three and four also posted child sexual exploitation images themselves in order to make illegal material accessible for users as well as to prompt users to post themselves. Defendant four, moreover, posted links to child sexual abuse material in the chat.In the course of investigations, the police were able to associate the forum with an Australian hosting provider. Taskforce Argos of the Queensland Police Service was able to seize the data of the forum, including threads, postings and not-yet-deleted messages, and take over the operation of the platform. Defendant four noticed that something was wrong and – via the darknet – warned members not to visit the site. Furthermore, he backed up the data of the platform and tried to close its servers. He was ultimately successful in closing the chat servers.The same people responsible for TGE led by defendant four now created a new platform by the name “ELYSIUM”. The forum was programmed anew but the chats were transferred from the backup to new domains and renamed. The fourth defendant, knowing that defendant one already hosted the so-called “RSP-Chat” (rollplayer-chat), asked him to further host Elysium. Defendant one, agreeing to host the platform on the server in his workshop to which only he had access, received data and scripts with step-by-step instructions of how to proceed. The same procedure was used with regards to maintenance, changes or updates.In order to log in and have unlimited access to content, users had to register with a username and password. The obligation to post material for verification purposes was, contrary to TGE, not introduced, which led to the registration of a large number of users within a short amount of time. At the time of the takedown of the platform (the night from 12 on the 13 June 2017), Elysium had 111,907 registered users. The defendants one and four registered on 19 November 2016, before the platform went online. Two further admins and nine moderators were registered, all of which were responsible for primary administration tasks.The forum was divided into different categories that contained security instructions and organizational information, as well as different image and video content. The forum was divided into “Girls”, which contained 1,713 threads, and “Boys”, which contained 153 threads. Both categories were divided into various subcategories. The chat rooms were structured in a hierarchal fashion as they were on the TGE platform. The chat sites contained a main chat room in English and smaller sub chat rooms in seven additional languages.The fourth defendant (together with defendant one) was responsible for the maintenance of the platform and supported his co-defendant in case of technical issues. He programmed scripts and regularly backed up the data on the site. He also worked as chat administrator ensuring order when members communicated.The first defendant, also an admin, was responsible for supplying the technical infrastructure and hosting which included continued maintenance of the servers. He was further a lead moderator of the ELYSIUM-GIRL-LOVERS-CHAT, where he had to support and supervise the members, in particular with regards to the platform rules.The second defendant registered on 23 November 2016. One week later at the latest, the defendant held the position of forum moderator. He checked and edited the threads published by members, blocked and prioritized certain content, deleted, shared or moved threads, and informed members on topics related to security. The second defendant was further active as a “registeredplus-member” on the forums.The third defendant undertook the tasks of a chat moderator on the ELYSIUM-GIRL-LOVERS-CHAT. The defendant was especially interested in expanding the chat room to include a page concerning female as well as male children under the age of five. Therefore, he assumed the role of chat admin in the newly created ELYSIUM-TINY-LOVERS-CHAT. He was responsible for recruiting staff members, member support as well as the creation of seasonally-changing background graphics. Mid-February 2017, he was demoted to “registeredplus-member” in the chat due to conflicts with the other chat admin.Despite no obligation to post illegal content, the defendants published numerous threads of child sexual exploitation material that were accessible to all users. Moreover, defendant four posted links to such material in the chat rooms.Defendant one additionally operated and hosted a so-called rollplayer-chat where pedophiles were able to act out sexual abuse of children in role-playing games. He came into contact with a user, to whom he sent three illicit images. During their communication, the user told the defendant that he had access to the nine-year-old son of his partner who he regularly abused. The defendant requested him to make and subsequently send compromising images of the boy while giving the user exact instructions about the poses. In return, defendant one sent images he made himself. This happened at least three times.Defendant three regularly exchanged messages with other pedophiles on the Elysium chat. He further wanted to meet his contacts in person. He particularly sought out active abusers in hopes of having the possibility to actively abuse children himself. The defendant sent some of his contacts illicit images and videos, some of which included material from his previous conviction of sexually abusing minors. When he got to know that one of his contacts lived alone with his two children, who were four and six years old at the time, the third defendant wanted to “fake-check” the contact, meaning that he wanted to make sure the contact was real and telling the truth since the defendant was unsure, and asked him to send an image. Subsequently, the defendant asked his contact if they could meet. The defendant visited the contact and his children between 16 and 21 August 2016. Together with the contact, the defendant sexually abused the children and took images of the acts in order to distribute them. After the visit, the message exchange resumed. The defendant requested that the contact send an illicit video of the daughter, which he did.During the investigation, when the defendants’ private and office spaces were searched and thousands of files of additional child sexual exploitation footage were found.In total, 124 counts were brought before court.",cybercrime,1
"This case concerned a dark web forum by the name of “Deutschland im Deep Web – Keine Kontrolle, alles erlaubt!” (""Germany on the Deep Web – No control, everything allowed!"", hereinafter DiDW). DiDW was created by the defendant, A.U., who operated under the username “luckyspax”. From 18 March 2013 to his provisional arrest on 8 June 2017, A.U. operated and acted as the sole administrator of DiDW from his residence in K.DiDW was a forum set up on the Tor network via the domain ""germanyhusicaysx.onion"", which was used by its users primarily for discussions and the (predominantly public) exchange of messages, but also for conducting illicit sales. To actively use the DiDW platform it was necessary to register under a user name and to provide a bitmessage address. Until it was shut down on 8 June 2017, the DiDW platform was a one of the largest German-language underground forums, with 23,028 registered users at last count. The defendant subdivided the DiDW platform into different thematic categories, which were intended for exchanging communication/information on certain topics or sales transactions. These categories (translated from their original German name) included, inter alia:- Religions (Islamists, Christian Fundementalists, Doomsday)- Freedom (Free Speech, Will and Suppression)- Sports (martial arts, bodybuilding, steroids and doping)- Politics and Economy- Deep Web - General (General topics about the Deep Web); Websites (Overview and discussion about Hidden Services); Tutorials (German tutorials about Tor, Hidden Services, PGP etc.); Bitcoins (speculation, anonymization and trading)- Security in Information Technology- Playground (Rip-off and Bullshit are welcome here)- Fraud and deception (Fraud, Carding and Crime)- Weapons (production, distribution and proper use)- Eroticism (sex, preferences, relationships and prostitution)- Suicide/suicide (effects, sharing of experiences and execution)- Drugs (General topics on medicines and drugs); Experience reports and tips (safer use, trip reports, opinions); Cultivation and production (exchange of experiences, problems and help); Research Chemicals (experiences, problems, ingredients and legality); - Marketplace - Offer verified (cannabis verified, stimulants verified, psychedelics verified, pharmacy verified); Offer (cannabis, stimulants, psychedelics, pharmacy, [new] services and software); Search (services, goods, information etc.); Free trade zone (bargain bin); Contact exchange (Interested in new contacts?); Experience reports and reviews (regarding offers here or on other marketplaces)(…)The differences between the category “Marketplace”- subcategory: Offer (Cannabis and other narcotic substances) and the category “Weapons”“Marketplace” – “Offer (Cannabis and other narcotic substances)” and “Offer verified”In order to offer cannabis and other drugs, there was a separate subcategory ""Offer"" and ""Offer verified"" in the category ""Marketplace"". The subcategory ""Offer"" was visible for every user. If a user wanted to post a new advertisement for the sale of narcotics, they had to write a descriptive advertising text including the requested purchase price according to the defendant's instructions. Additionally, the user had to add one or more pictures showing the offered goods, the name of the seller on the DiDW platform and the current date (so-called trustpics or proofpics). Such advertising text had to be sent to the defendant and activated by the defendant after verification. If the requirements set by the defendant had not yet been met, he first requested the seller to rectify the offer. Only then was the advertising text in the subcategory ""Offer"" visible to the other visitors to the site. The reason behind this was to detect any potential fraudsters, since it was quite common for drug traffickers to place fake ads. The defendant also stated that through his platform DiDW he wanted to create a safe environment for the trafficking in narcotics, so that consumers, just like him, would not be longer exposed to any risks buying narcotics substances on the streets.The ""Offer Verified"" subcategory was created later on, after the ""Offer"" subcategory had been set up. The decisive criterion for activation as a ""verified dealer"" was positive feedback from buyers and the length of time a seller had been active. A verified seller had the possibility to permanently post and edit offers without the interference of the defendant.Neither the users nor the defendant, as was known to each of them, had the required permit to traffic in narcotics or weapons. Between 27 September 2015 and 18 August 2016, the defendant activated at least 15 advertising texts from users for the sale of narcotics. Further, the defendant moved existing advertisements and those previously released by him from the subcategory ""Offer"" to the subcategory ""Offer Verified"" and marked the respective seller as ""Verified Seller"", thus enabling the advertising for the sale of narcotics without the respective required permission.“Weapons”There was no such subcategory for offering weapons within “Marketplace”, only the category “Weapons” itself, set up by the defendant approximately in June 2013 and, according to the description, serving information concerning the manufacture, distribution and proper use of firearms. The category “Weapons” was initially visible to every user. In response to the terrorist attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015, the defendant deactivated the visibility of the subcategory “Weapons” on 27 November 2015 due to the increasing interest of the media in the DiDW platform and in particular due to the suspicion expressed that the weapons used in Paris could have been traded via an “underground forum”. On 2 January 2016 the defendant reactivated the “Weapons” category, which was now visible to registered users only.Within the category “Weapons” users were able to publish posts offering weapons and ammunition or posts requesting certain weapons and ammunition. Contrary to the above-mentioned procedure in the subcategory ""Offer"" for narcotic substances, a separate activation of the offer by the defendant was not required. Rather, every registered user was free to start a new conversation and offer weapons and ammunition for sale or to post a corresponding request within that category. The defendant at least tolerated these actions.In total, by creating the category ""Weapons"", the defendant supported 8 purchase transactions and one exchange transaction of weapons from 11 February 2015 until his provisional arrest in June 2017.Sales transactions between the user “Maurächer” and the user “rico”Through the “Weapons” category on the DiDW platform, the user “Maurächer”, who expressed interest in purchasing a weapon, and the user “rico” got into contact and exchanged information concerning the purchase of a Glock 17. Gen. 4 “rico” possessed. “Maurächer” and “rico” communicated by means of encrypted posts in the encrypted messaging service “Bitmessage”. They agreed on a price and a transaction method and set up a time and place for the handing over of the weapon and EUR 4.000,00 in cash. The user “Maurächer” and the user “rico” finally met on May 20, 2016 and exchanged the money and the Glock 17 Gen. 4 including related ammunition. A few months later “Maurächer” and “rico” met again, as “Maurächer” requested to purchase some more ammunition for a total price of EUR 350.00 from “rico”.  With the acquired Glock 17 Gen. 4, 18 years old ""Maurächer"" carried out a mass shooting at the Olympia shopping center in Munich, Germany on 22 July 2016. Nine people were killed and several injured. The attacker killed himself after the shooting.“rico” (the seller of the weapon) was contacted by undercover agents and arrested in the context of a mock purchase. He was charged with negligent homicide in 9 cases and negligent bodily harm in 5 cases to 7 years imprisonment.The defendant had, at no time, knowledge of the contact and transactions between the user “Maurächer” and the user “rico” since they used encrypted communication channels. Neither was the defendant aware of the intended mass shooting carried out by “Maurächer”. However, he was aware of the fact that the DiDW platform and especially the “weapons” category was mainly used by buyers and sellers to anonymously and illegally offer/purchase weapons and ammunition, as a weapons permit was not required on his platform.The weapon: Glock 17 Gen. 4 caliber 9x19 mm, Individual number: XSH909 including corresponding Sellier & Bellot brand ammunitionThe removed serial-number on the firearm could be made visible again by ballistic experts and it therefore resulted that the weapon originated from the Slovak branch of “Glock”. The weapon was sold via other companies to the Slovak T. company, which re-declared the weapon as a so-called “Flobert gun” (Flobert guns have a relatively low muzzle velocity and can therefore be legally acquired without license in some jurisdictions, including in Slovakia at that time) in order to sell it legally to a purchaser. Via further dealers the weapon finally reached - converted into a live-firing firearm - the DiDW user with the nickname ""Hyena"", who illegally sold it to “rico”. Whether the weapon was actually ever converted into a “Flobert weapon” and when - if this was the case - it was converted back into a live-firing firearm, could not be determined by the investigation.Communication on DiDW mainly took place through the forums, which were accessible to every user and only partially encrypted. In addition, users could communicate by means of the internal messaging function for private messages, which was mandatorily encrypted using the PGP (“Pretty Good Privacy”) standard. Messages older than one month were automatically deleted. The users could further communicate via “Bitmessage” or, in real-time, via a messaging service set up on the basis of “Jabber/XXMP”, which required users to have a separate instant messaging application. The platform further offered an escrow service for transactions on DiDW.The defendant did not receive a share of the profit from the sales on the platform. The use of the escrow service was, likewise, not based on a fee. The platform and the defendant were solely financed by donations in bitcoin. Following an appeal for donations on 24 December 2015, the defendant received EUR 9,850.00.A.U. was charged with aiding the unlawful advertising of narcotics (28 counts), aiding the intentional unlawful trading with a firearm (7 counts), aiding the intentional unlawful acquisition of a semiautomatic handgun (2 counts), and intentional unlawful acquisition of narcotics (4 counts). He was also charged with aiding intentional unlawful trading in a firearm in conjunction with negligent killing (9 counts) in further conjunction with negligent bodily harm (5 counts) in relation to the sale of the weapon used by D.S. to carry out the mass shooting. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years.The parallel proceeding against ""rico"" (the seller of the weapon) can be found here.",cybercrime,1
"The case involved several counts of fraud, which were committed via so-called “fake shops” over the internet. The defendant operated a total of 21 fake shops from around December 2010 to December 2015 at least. The operations were mainly placed in Spain with the exceptions of some counts of fraud undertaken in the Netherlands. In particular, the defendant operated the following fake shops:- www.world-of-coffee.com- www.mobiltronic.net / www.world-of-mobiles.es - www.kaffeewelt24.net- www.mobilhaft.de- www.99preise.com- www.gammatronic.net / www.megashop-online.com- www.kaffeetraum.at- www.best-in-coffee.net- www.kaffeeprofi.net- www.world-of-coffee.net (/.co.at)- www.startsale.eu- www.norsale.net- www.norshop.de- www.kuechentechnik24.net- www.kuechentechnik24.at- www.kuechen-technik.net- www.best-of-coffee.net- www.solarcap.co.uk- www.solarthermie.nlThe defendant created the online presence for each of the fake shops and modeled the fully functional websites after several popular online retailers, including Amazon. For this purpose, he used the e-commerce software of the firm Shopware. Furthermore, the defendant heavily advertised the shops on Google, several price comparison websites as well as in newspapers.The aim of the fake shops was to give the impression that the defendant operated a serious e-commerce business and would actually deliver the products that were ordered in order to prompt the consumers to conclude a purchase. After the order was placed, a fully automated software would send an order confirmation along with a receipt and a payment request. The defendant only had to act during the maintenance of the software. The customers had to pay in advance as paying upon receiving the products or via Paypal was not an option. The money to pay for the products was either transferred to the accounts of the defendant, which were partially opened under a fake name, or to the accounts of payment agents. The agents B., G., S. B., H., J., M. and S. forwarded the money to the defendant after subtracting 15% that they could keep for themselves. These agents were recruited via eBay, Quoka, meinestadt.de and dhd24.com as well as via websites operated by the defendant himself, including bitcoinmarked.com and bitcoin-marketing.com. Regarding the other agents, there was no information on whether they acted on behalf of the defendant or whether he used their banking details without their knowledge. The products were, however, never send to the paying customers.At the beginning of the scam, the defendant indicated his own banking details under his real name. In order to minimize the risk of discovery, the defendant started looking for an accomplice who would take care of banking aspects. Via the darknet, the defendant met someone under the name ""B."" who would later supply the defendant with bank accounts and assist him while founding the companies of the fake shop websites. B. advised the defendant with regards to data codification and methods to avoid prosecution. He was also in charge of recruiting the payment agents with foreign bank accounts that redirected the money to B. after subtracting 15%. The recruitment of German payment agents was undertaken by the defendant himself. According to their agreement, the profits were shared 50:50 at first, then 60:40 and in the end 70:30 between the defendant and the accomplice B.The defendant, however, started mistrusting his partner and questioned whether he forwarded him the entire amount of the profits the defendant was entitled to. Therefore, the defendant started to look for a replacement of B. on the darknet towards the end of the offences in question. The new accomplice supplied the defendant with British accounts and was entitled to 60% of the amounts transferred to these accounts, the remaining 40% were forwarded to the defendant.The defendant acted to obtain financial benefit for him and his partners although he was aware that they were never entitled to the money transferred by the customers. The defendant did not have sufficient income and aimed at committing the offences in a scope and over a time period that would allow him to earn a living. The total amount of damage to the customers of the fake shops was EUR 282,536.72.",cybercrime,1
"This case concerns the proceedings of six defendants involved in trafficking illegal goods online. Two so-called Underground Economy forums (UE-forums), d.cc and g.me, were established for the purpose of selling/purchasing illegal goods and exchanging information that could subsequently be used for committing criminal offences. The illegal goods and data available for sale on the forum mainly included drugs, false documents, counterfeit money, and stolen personal data. The forums were accessible by conventional browsers via the Clearnet and could be found using popular search engines. In addition, the forums were accessible by a number of special browsers, such as the TOR-browser, via the darknet.In order to register for the forums, users had to provide an e-mail address and username on the platform and then contact N2 to activate the accounts. In addition to hosting advertisements for illicit goods, both forums provided a platform to exchange information with other users on topics such as anonymization and ways to protect against law enforcement detection and the dissemination of malware. Due to mistrust between the anonymous users, some of the transactions in the forums were concluded via an escrow service for a fee.H., G., and X. had leadership roles on the UEforums. Defendant H. was responsible for the technical aspects of the forums, such as maintaining servers and the security of the forums. He held the positions of administrator, moderator, and trustee, who received fees paid by users of the escrow service. Defendant G. held the position of moderator and was responsible for checking the compliance of users' postings with forum rules and sanctioning users where necessary. He further acted as a trustee for three transactions, sold official documents in one case, and acquired counterfeit money twice. Defendant X. held the position of “super moderator” and mainly provided technical support (e.g., the establishment and maintenance of the technical infrastructure of one of the forums). He also created a “scene guide” which provided users with tips on committing criminal offences as well as information on how to avoid identification by law enforcement officers. The defendant was further involved in the establishment and maintenance of the technical infrastructure of one of the forums, g.me. These defendants did not know each other in person but were in close contact for organizational purposes and communicated through areas of the forums that were only accessible to members in leadership positions and through various other encrypted messenger services.These defendants were charged and convicted for computer fraud (H.), attempted computer fraud (H.), illegally acquiring narcotic drugs (X.), aiding and abetting illicit trading in narcotic drugs in quantities which are not small (G., H., and X.), aiding and abetting illicit trading in narcotic drugs (G., H. and X.), aiding and abetting counterfeiting of money (G., H. and X.), aiding and abetting procurement of false official identity documents (G., H. and X.), and counterfeiting of money (G.). The court sentenced H. to 21 months’ imprisonment, G. to 12 months’ imprisonment, and X. to 14 months’ imprisonment for their crimes. The creator of the UEG forums and several other persons were also charged and convicted for crimes relating to the forums in separate trials.",cybercrime,1
"At the time of the crimes, the defendant A.T. had been working for a company producing and operating slot machines for several years. He advised its employees regarding the manipulation protection of the slot machines. He employed his son in law, P., as a computer specialist. The brother of the defendant, S.T., had been operating his own gambling halls.In 2013, A.T. and Dr. C. (the managing director and three-percent shareholder of the firm Ca. GmbH, which had put up slot machines of the firm L. GmbH in their casinos in Germany) decided to manipulate the software of the slot machines for financial gain. P., who knew of the plans, developed cards and dongles with which the software of the machines was manipulated to credit the player points (tradeable for cash) without previously having initiated a game. This was referred to as the “credit approach”. Additionally, P. integrated a “back door” in the software. This back door was activated by daily codes and manipulated the game in such a way that – instead of the player choosing between red and black without having any indication of the result – the same colour appeared multiple times in a row. This allowed the player to eliminated the usual risk of loss and receive points that could subsequently be traded for money.The original flash cards used by the slot machines were replaced by cards with the manipulated software developed by P. This swap happened at night, outside of the casinos’ business hours. At first, the back door was installed onto the flash cards with the original software. Later, the backdoor as well as the manipulated software to perform the credit approach were installed on a dongle (similar to a USB-stick) which was inserted into the slot machines.The credit approach was used two-hundred times between July 2014 and January 2015 to obtain EUR 4 485,965 in winnings from the slot machines. Between March 2014 and January 2015, the back door was used by 43 people instructed by A.T., resulting in proceeds of EUR 214,030. The people later instructed by S.T. obtained a total of EUR 1,218,420 from making use of the back door 1,770 times. In one instance, S.T. played himself and retrieved EUR 1,500 by using the back door.",cybercrime,0
"This case involved the criminal prosecution of the founder of the website “K....to” for over one million counts of commercial exploitation of copyright works.Starting in March 2008, the defendant and seven separately prosecuted accomplices gradually started forming an organized criminal group in order to operate this website. Until 8 June 2011, this website was the biggest German internet portal for pirated copies of film works, in particular it offered over 100,000 copies of movies, documentaries and TV shows. Until June 2011, the website was listed as one of the 50 most visited websites in Germany, at times being accessed over four million time in a day.The domain of the website was registered in Tonga. The access portal to the website was at first placed on servers in the Netherlands and since mid-2008 on servers in Russia. The location of the actual administration as well as the focus of the operations was, however, Germany.On the website, the defendant and his accomplices provided over one million links to copyrighted works of film and television free of charge without having exploitation rights. In total, 1,360,450 links were made public on this website. The links were either used to stream or download the pirated copies. To every link, a pirated copy of a film which was saved in the form of electronic data on servers of so-called “file hosting services”, internet service companies that commercially provided internet storage space and streaming options. After editing the pirated copies, the “uploaders” uploaded them to these servers. Due to the high number of users, the capacities of such file hosting services had to be high and were, hence, very expensive. The selection of the file hosting services was made by the uploaders. The admins of the website, however, checked the capacities and performance of the file hosting services before making the links public.The uploaded files were regularly converted into a specific data format in order to facilitate the streaming of the files. In this format, the duplications of the pirated copies were saved on the file hosting services. In a fully automated process, the file hosting services provided the uploaders with a link, which the uploaders then copied on their own servers and later uploaded them to the database of the “K....to” website via their personal access to the access control protocol of the site.The uploaders and file host service providers were not part of the core employees of “K....to”. However, file host services were partially also operated by the defendant or the other members of the group. Economically, the file hosting services and the corresponding uploaders were their own competing companies that only marketed their pirated copies via “K....to”. File hosting services that were operated by the defendant or other members of the group were preferred and were given competitive advantage in that their links were placed on the top of the website.The communication between the core employees usually happened via Skype. Written communication happened via the message tool of the access control protocol. When important decisions were made, Skype conferences were held, which all core employees would usually attend. The employees tasked with publishing the links were responsible for communication – under their alias – with the uploaders and file hosting service providers via the same message tool.The defendant was the founder and head of “K....to”. He designed the concept using similar websites from the United States as example. He handpicked the core employees, who were tasked with publishing the links as well as with operating maintaining the necessary programmes and technical devices, especially the Russian server. The defendant was responsible for procuring advertisement revenue generated via the platform and paying the expenses of the website. He was also in charge of paying the wages of the employees until April 2010. He was in constant contact with the representatives of the advertisement firms. The defendant also contributed to the damage control if visitor numbers dropped. He was also authorized to give instructions to all permanent employees and to represent “K....to” in negotiations. Likewise, he owned his own file hosting service.",cybercrime,1
"The defendants were members of a globally active organized criminal group based in Dortmund. The group formed for the purpose of illicitly gaining access to data stored on the magnetic strip as well as PINs of credit cards, producing falsified version of these cards and withdrawing money abroad. To that end, the defendant M. – in exchange of compensation – selected a bank branch and, together with other members of the organized criminal group, attached miniature cameras and skimming devices to the ATMs of the bank. If the data was obtained successfully, the defendant M. removed the camera and the device after a period of time and returned them to his point of contact, who arranged for the collected data to be used for producing the duplicate copies of the payment cards and the subsequent illicit withdrawals. In some of the cases, the defendant M. was not successful since the manipulation had been discovered before he was able to obtain any data.",cybercrime,0
"Between the beginning of 2008 and the beginning of 2011, the defendants S1. and S2. ran three different projects together, which all included cost traps. They were assisted – with different degrees of involvement – by five other defendants. In particular, this case concerned the online presence of Online P.C (case one) as well as www.....de (case two) and www.....de (case three).The functioning of the cost traps was identical in all three cases. The defendants offered services on their websites that were available for free and without additional effort in a similar way to numerous other websites. In case one, the services entailed so-called “Sinnlos-Angebote” (meaning pointless offers), such as love or sex tests, as well as databases with information that was publicly available on the internet, including fairytale and quote collections. In cases two and three, the services entailed providing freeware to download; freeware meaning programmes that can be downloaded free of charge on other websites (such as the programmes A.R. and M.F.).In order to obtain the services offered on the defendants’ websites, users had to specify their personal data on the registration page. The page included a recognizable cost indication, stating that the user concluded a one-year contract with the registration and was obliged to pay EUR 60.00 or EUR 84.00 respectively. However, the cost indication was placed in a way that most users would overlook it when visiting the website. The defendants were aware that almost no users would sign up had read the cost indication. The defendants’ whole business model was based on creating the false appearance that the offer was free of charge so that the highest possible number of users would sign up. As soon as the users had signed up based on their misconception, the defendants sent an invoice for the user fee although the defendants knew that most users never intended to conclude a fee-based contract.If the users did not pay, several notices and collection letters were sent to them that threatened further measures if payments were not made. Additionally, the defendants operating a call centre with a fee-based hotline where employees received user complaints and further prompted the users to pay the fee. Due to the payment requests and the information they received from the call centre, numerous users thought that their conduct was to be interpreted as a binding declaration of intent regarding the conclusion of the contract for compensation. Based on this misconception, numerous users paid the requested fee.In case one, the defendants caused a total damage of a minimum of EUR 272,285 to a minimum of 4,441 persons that either partially or completely paid the user feed; in case two they cased a total damage of a minimum of EUR 1,485,339 to a minimum of 23,829 persons and in case three a total damage of a minimum of EUR 2,787,919 to a minimum of 32,195 persons. In total this makes a minimum damage of EUR 4,545,543 to a minimum of 60,465 persons.All three projects were headed by S1. and S2. although S1. was the uncontested ringleader in all cases. He was the initiator, proposed the ideas and had the last word. He was in charge of the organizational structure and the technical implementation. Despite him being a key figure, his role was barely visible from the outside.The defendant S2. was the partner and right-hand man of S1. He was included in all relevant decisions although S1 had the final word. He was in charge of the day-to-day business and of the communication with the tax advisors, lawyers and advertising partners. Furthermore, the was in charge of the call centre until this task was taken over by the defendant M.Starting with the project www....de, M. was in charge of the call centre. Moreover, he advertised the websites of www....de.The defendant S3. was a lawyer that assisted the defendants S1. and S2. with collection procedures regarding www....de. He made available his name and title so that collections letters could be sent with the letterhead of a law firm.The defendants S4., H. and K. were the shadow managing directors of the companies operated by S1. and S2. The defendant S4. was the shadow managing director of Online P.C. in case one. The defendants H. and K. were the shadow managing directors of the billing companies regarding the user fees. All three defendants were also active in the call centre.",cybercrime,1
"The defendants W., P., M. and R. formed a structured association in order to disseminate mass-inciting and otherwise criminal songs via an internet radio stream.W., who had been promoted to organizer and head of the organized criminal group in the summer of 2007, rented a server and created the website “European Brotherhood Radio.” The radio stream was available on this site. Furthermore, building instructions of explosives and explosive devices could be found on the subpage “demolition expert” (in German, “Sprengmeister”). Regarding the technical procedure of the radio shows, W. provided the defendants P. and M, and later also the defendants B., Br. And F. with a programme with which the defendants were able to take over the stream of the moderator and thereby interrupt the show. The defendant W. and P. further moderated their own radio shows where they – in parts together, in parts on their own – played right-wing extremist songs and other illegal content. Moreover, they recruited other persons to moderate the shows, including the defendants B., Br. And F., and advertised the positions by using stickers, banners, jingles, etc. on the website as well as the subpages. On 21 February 2009, they also organized an advertising event for the radio.The defendant M. rented the radio stream via which the shows aired and was heard by 20 to 50 people. He also moderated a continuous broadcast from 24 to 26 February where he played right-wing extremist songs with mass-inciting and otherwise illegal content.The defendant R. invested several small amounts of money, including for the creation of the banner and the rent of the stream, and maintained the chats on the website.In addition, all of the defendants were in possession of thousands of right-wing extremist files, some of which fulfilled the offences incitement of masses, dissemination of propaganda material of unconstitutional organisations or use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations, in order to make them available to the listeners of the radio shows.Independent of the radio stream, the defendant W. was in possession of two objects banned under the Weapons Act as well as of a gun and ammunition which require a licence, which he did not have.",cybercrime,0
"In February 2017, the defendant and the separately prosecuted V., N., C., and P. formed an organized criminal group with the purpose of producing false guaranteed payment cards (i.e. credit cards, EC cards, and other cards that allow to initiate a guaranteed payment by the issuer and are specially protected against falsification) on a commercial basis and using such cards to withdraw money from ATMs abroad. In order to obtain the data necessary to falsify such payment cards, the organized criminal group used a card reader which comprised a storage medium and could be discretely attached to certain types of ATM slots. When inserting the payment card, the defendant and his accomplices were able to obtain the data saved on the magnetic strip of the card. The PIN was obtained by a separate storage medium placed on the keypad of the ATM. The organized criminal group used this method, known as skimming, several times: on 17 February 2007, the group obtained 21 data sets in Münster; on 24 February 2007, the group obtained an additional 21 data sets in Dinslaken; on 7 July 2007 the group further obtained 35 data sets in Osnabrück. After removing the attached device, the defendant -either alone or with the help of one accomplice – read the data saved by the storage medium. In Amsterdam, the illicitly obtained data was subsequently transferred to the magnetic strips of payback cards, which the members of the organized criminal group had previously acquired. Later the members made withdrawals using these false cards and the corresponding PINs.",cybercrime,0
"The case involved a phishing scheme operated by an organized criminal group of which the defendant was a member.The key figure of the phishing system in question, which was used from 2007 onwards, was a person called ""H3"" or ""H4"". He coordinated the organized criminal group, assigned the members their specific tasks and took care of the finances. He calculated the shares of the profits the members were entitled to and made sure they were transferred to them. He was also in charge of reimbursing the members for any expenses incurred on behalf of the group, including the rent for the servers from which the pishing scheme was operated. H3, together with a person called B5, provided “drops” (accounts of financial agents) and communicated with the “drop leaders” and “nalers”. H3 was further in charge of registering and creating websites used to recruit financial agents, in particular the websites ""G1 D.com"", ""T2.com"" and ""T4 .com"". The domain names were registered by L on behalf of H3.The malware necessary for the phishing operations quickly became outdated due to adaptions of anti-virus software, hence, a new version of the malware, in this case mainly trojans, had to be created several times in one week. The updated versions were partially developed by members of the organized criminal group and partially purchased from external service providers. During the time period considered by the court in this case, the updated versions were developed by persons outside the group.The spamming, meaning the dissemination of the malware, was undertaken by four to five different members of the group via e-mails and banner advertisements. The so-called “spammer”, also known as A1, was the main person in charge of this task. Other members that were also involved were W1 and M2.The computers infected by the malware via spamming were integrated in a bot net, which was controlled by a so-called log-server. This server could send commands to the infected computer, i.e. to download a key logger, or information on what data should be “phished”. Using this scheme, the members of the organized criminal group illicitly retrieved online-banking data, including account number and name, bank codes, Personal identification numbers (PINs) and transaction authentication numbers (TANs), as well as data to access various other online services. Moreover, the server was used as a “drop zone”, meaning that the infected computers transferred the retrieved data to the log server and where saved on a database on this server. The database entailed the folders ""D7 1/logs"" to ""D7 5/logs"", each of which was assigned to a different member of the group. For the purpose of managing and processing the data, each folder contained the application ""D8 Stats"". The victims of this scheme did not notice the retrieval of various data sets, since these processes ran in the background of the computer.The members W1 and A1 were mainly tasked with bank transfers for which they used the data saved on the log-server. They sorted the retrieved sets of data, checked their validity and entered the online accounts of their victims, where they checked the account balance. In case the account had a high balance and a high transfer limit, W1 and A1 chose one of the “drops” provided by H3 and B5. They made sure that account of the recipient belonged to the same banking association as the account of the victim, to minimize the time of the transfer. Once a match was found, W1 and A1 transferred money to the financial agents by using the phished TANs from the database. This way, approximately 150 transfers were made per week. The members transferring the amounts informed H3 or B5 about which drops they used and how much they transferred. This information was then forwarded to the “drop leaders”.The “drop leaders” then contacted the financial agents and gave them detailed instructions on when to withdraw the money and which account to forward it to. In cases where the agents acted too slowly or refused to act, the drop leaders pressured them. This could go as far as threatening them by phone or putting the agents on so-called “protection lists”, where they were denounced as fraudsters.In the time frame relevant to court, the financial agents were mostly recruited via the websites ""G1 D.com"", ""T2.com"" and ""T4 .com"". Those websites were similar in design and business model, as they all aimed at suggesting that the group was a serious financial service provider trying to minimize the time needed for transfers abroad. The financial agents were allowed to keep 5 to 10% of the amount of each transfer they made. They got an employment contract and personal access to the recruitment website, where they could access training documents and receive messages from the drop leaders.Independently from the recruitment websites, the group recruited agents via the “N6 complex”, a scheme where agents were told they would work for the firm N6 and had to forward calls. Once the money was illegally transferred to the accounts of the “employees”, they were told the transfer was a mistake and that they should withdraw the money as soon as possible and that the firm would send a courier to pick it up.In cases where the money was successfully transferred to foreign accounts, the recipients (“naler”) withdrew the money under a false name and reintroduced it in the banking system via a method unknown at the time of the proceedings. Via internet-based transfer systems, which converted fiat money into cryptocurrencies, the amount was transferred back to H3 at a later point in time. However, the amount could still be withdrawn or used to pay online, thereby converting it back to fiat money.The defendant of the case, I, came into contact with H3 in the end of 2006. In the course of 2007, he became a member of the organized criminal group. He held the position of technical coordinator, which entailed maintaining and improving the necessary systems as well as damage control in case problems occurred. His most important task was the administration and maintenance of the log server and the bot net. The defendant could directly access the server from his computer at home. He was also tasked with deleting data that was not up to date. He generated, installed and shared security certificates regarding the log server with the various members of the organized criminal group, which allowed the members to access the server. The certificates were regularly changed for security reasons. Moreover, he took care of extending the rental contract of the servers and coordinated the further development of the trojans and other malware, so-called “builds”, which he tested subsequently. Regarding the new “builds”, he was assisted by W1 and A1. In case the new versions worked, he ordered a “spam wave” of the updated malware.Additionally, the defendant was also tasked with money transfers, for which he was assigned the folder ""D7 2""of the log server database. He tasked W1 with some of the transfers assigned to him due to a lack of time. He was also in charged of dealing with any transfer problems of H3.In relation to the financial agents, the defendant rented the servers that hosted the recruitment websites, to which the defendant had a direct admin-access. He also took care of Voice-Over-IP-Systems for the drop leaders, which was used to call the financial agents via the internet directly on their landline without the possibility of tracing the call. He instructed A1 to rent a Virtual-Dedicated-Server for this purpose and to get a refund for the expenses from H3.Financially, the defendant received 20% of the amounts he transferred himself. He also received compensation for the other responsibilities, the amount of which is, however, unknown to the court.The organized criminal group continued their phishing operations from the end of 2005 until the arrest of the defendant in 2008. On 13 January 2009, the prosecutor’s office pressed charges against I and L on the grounds of computer fraud, data manipulation, and forming a criminal organization. On 10 June 2009, the proceedings of the two alleged were severed in order to speed up the judgment regarding the defendant I.",cybercrime,1
"This case involved an organized criminal group which distributed an ‘autodialer’ malware program. Between July 2002 and September 2003, the defendants Edward B and Jörn H operated a malware program which automatically installed itself on the computer of users who visited particular websites. The autodialer program then created a connection with the Internet by calling a number at the owner’s expense.The defendants worked with two other German men, who were tried and convicted separately for their involvement in this criminal operation, as well as a US national, a Ukrainian national, and a Latvian national. Through their criminal operations, the group gained more than EUR 12 million. Most of the group’s money was held in bank accounts in the USA, where the group had also founded companies. After obtaining money from their victims, the group transferred the money, usually through accounts in Florida, Latvia and Estonia.Approximately 100,000 persons fell victim to the organized criminal group's malware. These victims were mostly German.On 26 December 2006 the District Court of Osnabrück sentenced Edward B and Jörn H for four and three years and three months’ imprisonment, respectively. The two defendants were convicted for charges of computer fraud and data tampering. On 13 December 2007, the Federal Court of Justice confirmed the decision of the District Court.",cybercrime,0
"The defendant had been in Raqqa, Syria and was active there as the head of the IS office for Ruqya, a religious practice of exorcising spirits to heal suffering. In June 2015, the defendant bought Witness A, who belongs to the Yazidi religious group, and her five-year-old daughter, Witness B, as slaves in Syria. They had been captured by members of IS during the attack on the Sinjar area in the summer of 2014.The Defendant took Witness A and Witness B to Falluja in Iraq, where he forced them to stay for several weeks in the house he shared with Witness C. There, A and B were subject to the instructions of the defendant, who completely ruled over their lives, forbade them to leave the property, and chastised them on a daily basis in order to discipline them and keep them compliant, so that they lived in constant fear of him.Under the living conditions dictated by the defendant, Witness A and B suffered both physically and psychologically to a great extent. One day, the defendant asked Witness A to stand barefoot on the stone floor of the courtyard surrounding the house in the sun in order to punish and discipline her again. Daytime temperatures in Falluja at that time ranged from 38.1 to 51 degrees in the shade. At the defendant's behest, Witness A went back into the house after a while and, as instructed, turned her attention back to the cleaning work on the first floor of the house. Meanwhile, the defendant was angry because the child had urinated on a mattress due to illness. In order to punish and discipline B as well, the defendant tied the five-year-old child to the outer grating of the living room window. B was exposed to direct sunlight and could not move. When he went back the child was found dead due to a heat stroke.The defendant's wife, Witness C, was a defendant in another proceeding. She was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison for crimes against humanity in relation to the facts mentioned above.",other crimes,1
"This case concerns a pharmacist who manufactured and provided cancer patients with underdosed medical products for five years.In the period during which the crimes were committed, namely from 1 January 2012 until 29 November 2016, the defendant Peter S. was the sole owner and general manager of a public pharmacy in the city of Bottrop. In addition to the usual tasks of a pharmacy, the defendant specialised in manufacturing patient-specific parenteral drugs for cancer therapy, which were delivered to medical practices and hospitals. The medical products were partially manufactured by the defendant himself and partially by his employees in a clean laboratory that was established in 2001. Before the defendant’s arrest, the pharmacy had approximately 90 employees with an annual turnover of over EUR 40 million, EUR 20 million of which were related to the operation of the clean laboratory. Manufacturing ProcessFor every patient that would receive patient-specific drugs, the pharmacy received a so-called therapy protocol by the attending physician before the treatment cycle. Most of the time, the protocol was sent by fax. The protocol contained every pharmaceutical preparation of the treatment cycle, their treatment date, as well as the quantity of active ingredients and the form of the medication. The corresponding prescriptions were received in addition to or shortly after the therapy protocols. The employees of the clean laboratory, subsequently, recorded the requested preparations in accordance with the therapy protocols in a computer program called “Zenzy,” a software specifically adapted to the organisation and manufacture of medication. On the basis of the information entered in the software, the employees printed labels for the manufactured medical products, which included the name and birthday of the patient, the manufacture number as generated by the software, the active ingredient and its quantity, the name of the attending physician, and information for the use and shelf life. The label did not contain information on the disease or state of the patient. Each medication received two labels, one was used for the manufacture and put on the packaging and the other was archived in the pharmacy.The manufacture of the medical products in accordance with the labels happened in the clean laboratory. Employees had to go through air locks before entering and wear protective clothing during their work in the lab. Two employees worked on the manufacture of one medical product, in accordance with the four eyes principle, to guarantee the quality of the drugs. The defendant, however, was an exception to these rules. He often entered the laboratory in street clothes and worked on medications by himself when no other employees were present in the lab. The employees of the clean laboratory created a manufacture protocol, which was a pre-printed form that was later completed by the employees by hand and contained the second label for the purpose of filing. After the manufacture, the medical products were given to the drivers of the pharmacy.The computer software “Zenzy” also offered the possibility to record the delivery of ingredients which were later used for the manufacture. However, there was also a second software for ingredient deliveries to the whole pharmacy, not just the clean laboratory, called “Prokas,” which was completely separate from “Zenzy.” Therefore, ingredients for the manufacture of medical products had to be entered manually into both programs. The correct entry into both programs was, however, neglected, which resulted in “Zenzy” often containing minus stocks as more ingredients were used during the manufacture than previously entered in the software. As a consequence, there was no meaningful information within one program on the quantity of active ingredients actually used in relation to the quantity prescribed.Management of the clean laboratory and tasks of the defendantThe defendant had managed the clean laboratory since 2001 and, hence, even before he became the sole owner and general manager of the pharmacy. All significant decisions were taken by the defendant, including the decision to start manufacturing patient-specific parenteral drugs and establish the clean laboratory. He alone planned the lab, which was set up and furnished according to his wishes. The same applies to the move of the lab to another, bigger location opposite the street of the pharmacy. He alone decided who to hire and held all interviews himself. The defendant further managed the daily operations of the clean laboratory, including working hours and areas of responsibility of the other employees.In addition, he was solely responsible for the acquisition of the ingredients and placed orders of ingredients himself. In exceptional cases, other employees would place orders at the explicit instruction of the defendant. In addition, the defendant manufactured medical products himself on a daily basis and sometimes even on the weekend. He would work alone and decide which medical products he would produce, although he mostly focused on the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies as they were particularly expensive. This task is quite unusual for the owner of a pharmacy as the manufacture would usually be undertaken by subordinates, often by pharmaceutical technical assistants.Although the defendant hired a commercial manager, who was a friend from school, in 2012 (though he only started working full time in 2014), the defendant did not allow him to view the banks accounts used for accounting purposes or the balance sheets. The commercial manager was only allowed to view the operational accounts. For this reason, the bookkeeping of the commercial manager was limited to preparing documents and receipts for the tax consultant.The crimesOn 1 January 2012 at the latest, the defendant decided to increase the profit of the pharmacy by illegally and secretly saving active ingredients. He intended to reduce the quantity of active ingredients in the majority of patient-specific parenteral drugs manufacture in the clean laboratory in violation of the treatment protocol established by the attending physician and manufacturing instructions of the pre-printed label. He further intended to settle the costs of falsified medical products with statutory health insurance, private health insurances, persons qualifying for special benefits, directly paying patients, and other private or public paying entities, despite knowing that they would not make payments if they knew the nature of the medical products. He wanted to create pecuniary benefits to which he knew he had no right.In the following five years, until his arrest on 29 November 2016, he systematically implemented this plan. In a majority of cases, the defendant did not add the requested quantity of active ingredients to the medical products he manufactured himself. Nonetheless, he attached the pre-printed labels to the packaging and sent them to the attending physicians. In most cases, these medical products were used as part of the cancer treatment. Subsequently, the costs were settled as set out above. While the defendant manufactured most of the falsified medical products himself, there were at least two other employees that also manufactured underdosed products in the clean laboratory at the instigation or instruction, or at least with the general knowledge and tolerance of the defendant.Investigation, arrest and criminal proceedingsAfter hearing rumours that the medical products were not manufactured correctly, the commercial manager checked several documents and referred the police to employees of the clean laboratory for further investigation. After receiving a manufactured medical product and confirming its fraudulent nature, the police searched the clean laboratory, the pharmacy and the private estate of the defendant on 26 November 2017 and subsequently arrested the defendant.The defendant was ultimately convicted of manufacture of or placing on the market falsified medicinal products or active substances, and fraud, while being found not guilty of bodily harm, dangerous bodily harm, murder, and murder under specific aggravating circumstances. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison on 6 July 2018. The court further ordered the confiscation of EUR 17 million and an occupational ban.",other crimes,1
"In June 2004 the defendants H and V became involved in a criminal enterprise to bring 900,000 untaxed and duty-free cigarettes from Ukraine to Melle, Germany. The criminal enterprise was masterminded by a group of persons who were not identified at the time of trial.These cigarettes were later loaded onto the truck of Ku. In July 2004, Ku delivered the cigarettes to a customer in England. K assisted as a translator. H and V had each been promised a share of five percent of the profit of selling these cigarettes on the English black market.At the end of July 2004, V and Ku, in agreement with the other defendants, drove a truck to Hungary where 1,610,800 cigarettes were loaded and brought from Hungary to Birmingham, England, via Germany. The vehicle and the cigarettes were subsequently detected and confiscated by English authorities. In August 2004, the group repeated the venture with another 1,600,000 cigarettes.In November 2004, 2,500,000 cigarettes were sent to the truck workshop of Ku to be loaded onto another vehicle. The truck and the cigarettes were subsequently confiscated in the Netherlands, on route to England.In total, import and excise duties of almost EUR 1.1 million were evaded by the organised criminal group’s activities.The District Court of Bielefeld sentenced the defendants for commercial and gang-related smuggling. On appeal, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany held that the findings were not supported. The Court held, however, that the cases justified convictions for commercial tax evasion and aiding and abetting tax evasion. The Court accordingly changed the defendants’ convictions.",other crimes,0
"This case concerned a dark web forum by the name of “Deutschland im Deep Web – Keine Kontrolle, alles erlaubt!” (""Germany on the Deep Web – No control, everything allowed!"", hereinafter DiDW). DiDW was created by the defendant, A.U., who operated under the username “luckyspax”. From 18 March 2013 to his provisional arrest on 8 June 2017, A.U. operated and acted as the sole administrator of DiDW from his residence in K.DiDW was a forum set up on the Tor network via the domain ""germanyhusicaysx.onion"", which was used by its users primarily for discussions and the (predominantly public) exchange of messages, but also for conducting illicit sales. To actively use the DiDW platform it was necessary to register under a user name and to provide a bitmessage address. Until it was shut down on 8 June 2017, the DiDW platform was a one of the largest German-language underground forums, with 23,028 registered users at last count. The defendant subdivided the DiDW platform into different thematic categories, which were intended for exchanging communication/information on certain topics or sales transactions. These categories (translated from their original German name) included, inter alia:- Religions (Islamists, Christian Fundementalists, Doomsday)- Freedom (Free Speech, Will and Suppression)- Sports (martial arts, bodybuilding, steroids and doping)- Politics and Economy- Deep Web - General (General topics about the Deep Web); Websites (Overview and discussion about Hidden Services); Tutorials (German tutorials about Tor, Hidden Services, PGP etc.); Bitcoins (speculation, anonymization and trading)- Security in Information Technology- Playground (Rip-off and Bullshit are welcome here)- Fraud and deception (Fraud, Carding and Crime)- Weapons (production, distribution and proper use)- Eroticism (sex, preferences, relationships and prostitution)- Suicide/suicide (effects, sharing of experiences and execution)- Drugs (General topics on medicines and drugs); Experience reports and tips (safer use, trip reports, opinions); Cultivation and production (exchange of experiences, problems and help); Research Chemicals (experiences, problems, ingredients and legality); - Marketplace - Offer verified (cannabis verified, stimulants verified, psychedelics verified, pharmacy verified); Offer (cannabis, stimulants, psychedelics, pharmacy, [new] services and software); Search (services, goods, information etc.); Free trade zone (bargain bin); Contact exchange (Interested in new contacts?); Experience reports and reviews (regarding offers here or on other marketplaces)(…)The differences between the category “Marketplace”- subcategory: Offer (Cannabis and other narcotic substances) and the category “Weapons”“Marketplace” – “Offer (Cannabis and other narcotic substances)” and “Offer verified”In order to offer cannabis and other drugs, there was a separate subcategory ""Offer"" and ""Offer verified"" in the category ""Marketplace"". The subcategory ""Offer"" was visible for every user. If a user wanted to post a new advertisement for the sale of narcotics, they had to write a descriptive advertising text including the requested purchase price according to the defendant's instructions. Additionally, the user had to add one or more pictures showing the offered goods, the name of the seller on the DiDW platform and the current date (so-called trustpics or proofpics). Such advertising text had to be sent to the defendant and activated by the defendant after verification. If the requirements set by the defendant had not yet been met, he first requested the seller to rectify the offer. Only then was the advertising text in the subcategory ""Offer"" visible to the other visitors to the site. The reason behind this was to detect any potential fraudsters, since it was quite common for drug traffickers to place fake ads. The defendant also stated that through his platform DiDW he wanted to create a safe environment for the trafficking in narcotics, so that consumers, just like him, would not be longer exposed to any risks buying narcotics substances on the streets.The ""Offer Verified"" subcategory was created later on, after the ""Offer"" subcategory had been set up. The decisive criterion for activation as a ""verified dealer"" was positive feedback from buyers and the length of time a seller had been active. A verified seller had the possibility to permanently post and edit offers without the interference of the defendant.Neither the users nor the defendant, as was known to each of them, had the required permit to traffic in narcotics or weapons. Between 27 September 2015 and 18 August 2016, the defendant activated at least 15 advertising texts from users for the sale of narcotics. Further, the defendant moved existing advertisements and those previously released by him from the subcategory ""Offer"" to the subcategory ""Offer Verified"" and marked the respective seller as ""Verified Seller"", thus enabling the advertising for the sale of narcotics without the respective required permission.“Weapons”There was no such subcategory for offering weapons within “Marketplace”, only the category “Weapons” itself, set up by the defendant approximately in June 2013 and, according to the description, serving information concerning the manufacture, distribution and proper use of firearms. The category “Weapons” was initially visible to every user. In response to the terrorist attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015, the defendant deactivated the visibility of the subcategory “Weapons” on 27 November 2015 due to the increasing interest of the media in the DiDW platform and in particular due to the suspicion expressed that the weapons used in Paris could have been traded via an “underground forum”. On 2 January 2016 the defendant reactivated the “Weapons” category, which was now visible to registered users only.Within the category “Weapons” users were able to publish posts offering weapons and ammunition or posts requesting certain weapons and ammunition. Contrary to the above-mentioned procedure in the subcategory ""Offer"" for narcotic substances, a separate activation of the offer by the defendant was not required. Rather, every registered user was free to start a new conversation and offer weapons and ammunition for sale or to post a corresponding request within that category. The defendant at least tolerated these actions.In total, by creating the category ""Weapons"", the defendant supported 8 purchase transactions and one exchange transaction of weapons from 11 February 2015 until his provisional arrest in June 2017.Sales transactions between the user “Maurächer” and the user “rico”Through the “Weapons” category on the DiDW platform, the user “Maurächer”, who expressed interest in purchasing a weapon, and the user “rico” got into contact and exchanged information concerning the purchase of a Glock 17. Gen. 4 “rico” possessed. “Maurächer” and “rico” communicated by means of encrypted posts in the encrypted messaging service “Bitmessage”. They agreed on a price and a transaction method and set up a time and place for the handing over of the weapon and EUR 4.000,00 in cash. The user “Maurächer” and the user “rico” finally met on May 20, 2016 and exchanged the money and the Glock 17 Gen. 4 including related ammunition. A few months later “Maurächer” and “rico” met again, as “Maurächer” requested to purchase some more ammunition for a total price of EUR 350.00 from “rico”.  With the acquired Glock 17 Gen. 4, 18 years old ""Maurächer"" carried out a mass shooting at the Olympia shopping center in Munich, Germany on 22 July 2016. Nine people were killed and several injured. The attacker killed himself after the shooting.“rico” (the seller of the weapon) was contacted by undercover agents and arrested in the context of a mock purchase. He was charged with negligent homicide in 9 cases and negligent bodily harm in 5 cases to 7 years imprisonment.The defendant had, at no time, knowledge of the contact and transactions between the user “Maurächer” and the user “rico” since they used encrypted communication channels. Neither was the defendant aware of the intended mass shooting carried out by “Maurächer”. However, he was aware of the fact that the DiDW platform and especially the “weapons” category was mainly used by buyers and sellers to anonymously and illegally offer/purchase weapons and ammunition, as a weapons permit was not required on his platform.The weapon: Glock 17 Gen. 4 caliber 9x19 mm, Individual number: XSH909 including corresponding Sellier & Bellot brand ammunitionThe removed serial-number on the firearm could be made visible again by ballistic experts and it therefore resulted that the weapon originated from the Slovak branch of “Glock”. The weapon was sold via other companies to the Slovak T. company, which re-declared the weapon as a so-called “Flobert gun” (Flobert guns have a relatively low muzzle velocity and can therefore be legally acquired without license in some jurisdictions, including in Slovakia at that time) in order to sell it legally to a purchaser. Via further dealers the weapon finally reached - converted into a live-firing firearm - the DiDW user with the nickname ""Hyena"", who illegally sold it to “rico”. Whether the weapon was actually ever converted into a “Flobert weapon” and when - if this was the case - it was converted back into a live-firing firearm, could not be determined by the investigation.Communication on DiDW mainly took place through the forums, which were accessible to every user and only partially encrypted. In addition, users could communicate by means of the internal messaging function for private messages, which was mandatorily encrypted using the PGP (“Pretty Good Privacy”) standard. Messages older than one month were automatically deleted. The users could further communicate via “Bitmessage” or, in real-time, via a messaging service set up on the basis of “Jabber/XXMP”, which required users to have a separate instant messaging application. The platform further offered an escrow service for transactions on DiDW.The defendant did not receive a share of the profit from the sales on the platform. The use of the escrow service was, likewise, not based on a fee. The platform and the defendant were solely financed by donations in bitcoin. Following an appeal for donations on 24 December 2015, the defendant received EUR 9,850.00.A.U. was charged with aiding the unlawful advertising of narcotics (28 counts), aiding the intentional unlawful trading with a firearm (7 counts), aiding the intentional unlawful acquisition of a semiautomatic handgun (2 counts), and intentional unlawful acquisition of narcotics (4 counts). He was also charged with aiding intentional unlawful trading in a firearm in conjunction with negligent killing (9 counts) in further conjunction with negligent bodily harm (5 counts) in relation to the sale of the weapon used by D.S. to carry out the mass shooting. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years.The parallel proceeding against ""rico"" (the seller of the weapon) can be found here.",trafficking in firearms,1
"In summer 2012, out of a sense of adventure and passion for collecting, the defendant decided to get in contact with the firearms trafficking scene on the internet. He therefore created himself an account in the German Darknet forum “DiDW” (Germany in the Deepweb) under the pseudonym “rico”. He made his first contacts with firearms dealers and subsequently illegally purchased his first firearms. Therefore he regularly went abroad, including to Slovakia, Czech republic and Switzerland, and received several firearms from users he had met before on the Darknet forum. From time to time, the defendant’s passion for collecting weapons increasingly developed into an interest in the financial aspect of dealing with firearms. In order to finance further purchases of firearms and to generate a substantial source of income, the defendant, who was unemployed at that time, decided, at the latest at the beginning of 2016, to repeatedly sell weapons on the Darknet under his pseudonym ""rico"". He therefore purchased more than ten firearms, including some firearms of the model “Glock” from the Darknet user “Hyena”. In May 2016 the defendant even decided to move to Marburg, Germany due to better connection to his business partners in Eastern Europe from Marburg. The firearms were stored and hidden in an underground depot (box) in the middle of the woods nearby a highway (Köln-Ost).The defendant sold several weapons to interested customers who approached him via the Darknet. Amongst his customers was also 18-years old DiDW user “Maurächer”, who expressed interest in purchasing a weapon for self-defence reasons. “Rico” and “Maurächer” exchanged several encrypted messages via the messenger service “Bitmessenger” and finally agreed on a price of € 4,000.00 for a Glock 17 Gen. 4 including ammunition, “rico” had before purchased from “Hyena” for € 1,600.00 in Czech Republic. The weapon originally was distributed by a Slovak branch of Glock and was sold, via other companies to the Slovak company T., which converted it into a so called “Flobert” weapon, and then somehow was converted back into a sharp weapon by further costumers, until it reached “Hyena”.In May 2016 “rico” and “Maurächer” finally met up at a bus terminal in Marburg where the defendant alias “rico” handed over the weapon Glock 17 Gen. 4, calibre 9x19 mm and about 200 rounds of ammunition of the brand “Sellier & Bellot” to “Maurächer”. “Maurächer” told him he needed the weapon for self-defence, as he recently moved to a dangerous neighbourhood. The defendant had no idea of “Maurächer’s” plan to kill several people, nor did he expect it. However, he was aware of the lack of trustworthiness of people operating in the Darknet forums. The possible dangers of selling firearms to people without a legal permit however were ignored by the defendant, for the sake of his own financial profit.Ten days later, “Maurächer” again contacted the defendant in order to purchase more ammunition for the total price of € 350,00. They met once again at the same bus terminal and exchanged the money in cash and the ammunition. “Maurächer” told the defendant he may “shoot some foreigners” with the additional ammunition and later on said this was a joke, as the defendant repeatedly warned him not to fool around like that.With the acquired Glock 17 Gen. 4, 18 years old mentally unstable ""Maurächer"" carried out a mass shooting at the Olympia shopping center in Munich, Germany on July 22, 2016. Nine people were killed and several injured. The attacker killed himself after the shooting. According to his own information, “rico” collapsed right after hearing in the media “Maurächer” was the one who carried out the mass shooting.Anyhow, “rico” did not stop dealing with firearms on the Darknet. Undercover investigators used an Darknet account of the user “sectorplantone” that had taken over, got into contact with the defendant via the Darknet and expressed interest concerning a firearm purchase. The undercover agent and “rico” agreed on a fully automatic rifle VZ 58 and a semi-automatic Glock 17 Gen. 3 for a total price of € 8,000.00. Both agreed to meet up personally on August 16th, 2016 at the Marburg bus terminal, where finally the arrest of the defendant took place and three weapons were seized.The defendant was found guilty of intentional unlawful trafficking, transfer, carrying and commercial possession of firearms, weapons of war and ammunition in several cases in combination with negligent homicide in nine cases and negligent bodily injury in five cases. He was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment and the confiscation of proceeds of crime amounting to € 25,400.00 was ordered by the Munich Regional Court. The Supreme Court (BGH) upheld the judgement of the Munich Regional Court.The parallel proceeding against the provider of the dark-web market place can be found here.",trafficking in firearms,1
"The defendants W., P., M. and R. formed a structured association in order to disseminate mass-inciting and otherwise criminal songs via an internet radio stream.W., who had been promoted to organizer and head of the organized criminal group in the summer of 2007, rented a server and created the website “European Brotherhood Radio.” The radio stream was available on this site. Furthermore, building instructions of explosives and explosive devices could be found on the subpage “demolition expert” (in German, “Sprengmeister”). Regarding the technical procedure of the radio shows, W. provided the defendants P. and M, and later also the defendants B., Br. And F. with a programme with which the defendants were able to take over the stream of the moderator and thereby interrupt the show. The defendant W. and P. further moderated their own radio shows where they – in parts together, in parts on their own – played right-wing extremist songs and other illegal content. Moreover, they recruited other persons to moderate the shows, including the defendants B., Br.

On 21 February 2009, they also organized an advertising event for the radio.The defendant M. rented the radio stream via which the shows aired and was heard by 20 to 50 people. He also moderated a continuous broadcast from 24 to 26 February where he played right-wing extremist songs with mass-inciting and otherwise illegal content.The defendant R. invested several small amounts of money, including for the creation of the banner and the rent of the stream, and maintained the chats on the website.In addition, all of the defendants were in possession of thousands of right-wing extremist files, some of which fulfilled the offences incitement of masses, dissemination of propaganda material of unconstitutional organisations or use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations, in order to make them available to the listeners of the radio shows.Independent of the radio stream, the defendant W. was in possession of two objects banned under the Weapons Act as well as of a gun and ammunition which require a licence, which he did not have.",trafficking in firearms,0
"The defendant had been in Raqqa, Syria and was active there as the head of the IS office for Ruqya, a religious practice of exorcising spirits to heal suffering. In June 2015, the defendant bought Witness A, who belongs to the Yazidi religious group, and her five-year-old daughter, Witness B, as slaves in Syria. They had been captured by members of IS during the attack on the Sinjar area in the summer of 2014.The Defendant took Witness A and Witness B to Falluja in Iraq, where he forced them to stay for several weeks in the house he shared with Witness C. There, A and B were subject to the instructions of the defendant, who completely ruled over their lives, forbade them to leave the property, and chastised them on a daily basis in order to discipline them and keep them compliant, so that they lived in constant fear of him.Under the living conditions dictated by the defendant, Witness A and B suffered both physically and psychologically to a great extent. One day, the defendant asked Witness A to stand barefoot on the stone floor of the courtyard surrounding the house in the sun in order to punish and discipline her again. Daytime temperatures in Falluja at that time ranged from 38.1 to 51 degrees in the shade. At the defendant's behest, Witness A went back into the house after a while and, as instructed, turned her attention back to the cleaning work on the first floor of the house. Meanwhile, the defendant was angry because the child had urinated on a mattress due to illness. In order to punish and discipline B as well, the defendant tied the five-year-old child to the outer grating of the living room window. B was exposed to direct sunlight and could not move. When he went back the child was found dead due to a heat stroke.The defendant's wife, Witness C, was a defendant in another proceeding. She was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison for crimes against humanity in relation to the facts mentioned above.",trafficking in persons,1
"Subject of the case were criminal proceedings brought against four individual offenders, a father (G.A) and three of his children (E.A, K.A, and S.A). The defendants were accused of having recruited and transported five homeless polish citizens across the German-Polish border to Berlin, where the victims were forced to steal from several convenience stores. The two female victims were additionally forced into prostitution under the pretense that their travel has caused a significant debt which needed to be repaid. Upon arrival in Germany, offenders confiscated the polish identity cards of the five polish citizens. The victims were then brought to an apartment belonging to a previously uninvolved German citizen (P). Over a period of two weeks, victims were forced to steal food, alcohol, cosmetics, electronics, and other valuables following the clear instruction of all four offenders. During the day, victims were not allowed to leave the apartment by themselves and at night the apartment was locked with a key by P. Victims were regularly beaten, threatened, and insulted, as well as forcibly detained in P.’s apartment, which three of the offenders and the five victims shared with P. On several occasions, E.A., S.A. and G.A. accompanied the two female victims to multiple bars for the purpose of soliciting sexual services. On one such occasion, the two women were brought to the home of a perspective user of sexual services, who, however, did not engage in any sexual activities with either of the victims. One of the female victims was further forced to perform sexual acts with both P (in exchange of the continued use of the apartment for the criminal activities of the group) as well as with one of the male victims (for the purpose of humiliating, degrading and controlling the two victims). Two of the defendants (E.A. and the underaged K.A.) recorded the rape with their phones while insulting the victims and while giving instructions. The trafficking ended when the four victims were arrested by the police after an attempt to steal goods from a supermarket.The case is related to the criminal proceedings against P, the owner of the apartment who was not otherwise involved in the organized criminal activities.

"Subject of the proceeding is a Chilean-German dual national (P.) who hosted five Polish homeless citizens that were being trafficked for the purpose of stealing groceries, electronics and cosmetics by the family A. Two female victims were additionally forced to solicit prostitution, did, however, never engage in any paid sexual activity. P. was approached by a female member of the family A. after the victims were recruited and transported to Berlin, Germany. He was asked to host not only the five victims but also three perpetrators in his 2-bedroom-apartment, which was also used to temporarily store stolen goods. Victims were not allowed to leave the apartment without a member of A. present. During the night, P. locked the main door without revealing the location of the keys.P. was not directly involved in the abuse or coercion of victims to commit criminal acts or prostitution. On the other hand, at least on three occasions P. drove the victims to different groceries stores and helped in the transportation of the stolen good for which P. was neither paid nor received any other form of compensation. During the trial P. kept insisting that he did not know that the five Polish “guests” were in fact victims of trafficking and that the stolen goods stored in his apartment originated from illegal activities. He could not communicate with either of the victims, as they did not speak any German, English, or Spanish and he claims he was only interested in helping people in need. On one occasion, while on a walk with one of the female victims, P. was requested to call «Police?» (in English). After his reply that the police was not there, the victim pretended to have to urinate and tried to escape. She was later found by two members of the family A. and brought back to the defendant’s apartment. The situation of trafficking was only terminated, when police apprehended the five victims after an attempt to steal groceries in a supermarket. The next day, P.’s apartment and car were searched, where multiple incriminating goods were found and confiscated.The case is related to the criminal proceedings against four offenders of the family A. who were subsequently found guilty for transporting and harbouring victims of human trafficking, gang theft, rape, and assault by the same court. https://sherloc.unodc.org/cld/case-law-doc/criminalgroupcrimetype/deu/2019/513_kls_255_js_63718_3818.html?lng=en&tmpl=sherloc",trafficking in persons,1
"With the assistance of a professional trafficking network, the defendant B on six occasions recruited Nigerian women to bring them to Duisburg, Germany for prostitution. On three of these occasions, the women were brought to Germany over Belgium and France. In two cases, women were brought to Germany over Turkey, Greece, Belgium and France, and in one case the trafficking occurred over Egypt and Belgium.Each of the women were lured to Germany with the prospect of good jobs and earnings. In return for the unauthorised entry into Germany, the women had to pay large sums of money to their traffickers (approximately EUR 50,000 per person). The women were not aware they would be forced into prostitution to repay these debts.To ensure that the women would meet the demands of the smugglers and comply with the defendants' instructions, they were put under pressure by being made to swear a ""juju oath” before leaving Nigeria. The women were believers of “juju magic” and were afraid of being ""cursed"" by a “juju priest”.With the threat of the “curse” and by using her position as the women’s only contact in Germany, the defendant B led the women to take up their work as prostitutes. The accused forwarded the women's income to the smuggling network. From the trafficked women’s earnings, the accused received about EUR 25,000 per woman.Defendants B, C and D were each convicted at trial in the District Court of Duisburg. Defendant B was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. Defendant C was sentenced to one year and six months’ imprisonment, suspended. Additionally, the Court ordered that defendants B and C jointly pay EUR 22,400 to witness G, one of their victims.

"This case concerned a dark web forum by the name of “Deutschland im Deep Web – Keine Kontrolle, alles erlaubt!” (""Germany on the Deep Web – No control, everything allowed!"", hereinafter DiDW). DiDW was created by the defendant, A.U., who operated under the username “luckyspax”. From 18 March 2013 to his provisional arrest on 8 June 2017, A.U. operated and acted as the sole administrator of DiDW from his residence in K.DiDW was a forum set up on the Tor network via the domain ""germanyhusicaysx.onion"", which was used by its users primarily for discussions and the (predominantly public) exchange of messages, but also for conducting illicit sales. To actively use the DiDW platform it was necessary to register under a user name and to provide a bitmessage address. Until it was shut down on 8 June 2017, the DiDW platform was a one of the largest German-language underground forums, with 23,028 registered users at last count. The defendant subdivided the DiDW platform into different thematic categories, which were intended for exchanging communication/information on certain topics or sales transactions. These categories (translated from their original German name) included, inter alia:- Religions (Islamists, Christian Fundementalists, Doomsday)- Freedom (Free Speech, Will and Suppression)- Sports (martial arts, bodybuilding, steroids and doping)- Politics and Economy- Deep Web - General (General topics about the Deep Web); Websites (Overview and discussion about Hidden Services); Tutorials (German tutorials about Tor, Hidden Services, PGP etc.); Bitcoins (speculation, anonymization and trading)- Security in Information Technology- Playground (Rip-off and Bullshit are welcome here)- Fraud and deception (Fraud, Carding and Crime)- Weapons (production, distribution and proper use)- Eroticism (sex, preferences, relationships and prostitution)- Suicide/suicide (effects, sharing of experiences and execution)- Drugs (General topics on medicines and drugs); Experience reports and tips (safer use, trip reports, opinions); Cultivation and production (exchange of experiences, problems and help); Research Chemicals (experiences, problems, ingredients and legality); - Marketplace - Offer verified (cannabis verified, stimulants verified, psychedelics verified, pharmacy verified); Offer (cannabis, stimulants, psychedelics, pharmacy, [new] services and software); Search (services, goods, information etc.); Free trade zone (bargain bin); Contact exchange (Interested in new contacts?); Experience reports and reviews (regarding offers here or on other marketplaces)(…)The differences between the category “Marketplace”- subcategory: Offer (Cannabis and other narcotic substances) and the category “Weapons”“Marketplace” – “Offer (Cannabis and other narcotic substances)” and “Offer verified”In order to offer cannabis and other drugs, there was a separate subcategory ""Offer"" and ""Offer verified"" in the category ""Marketplace"". The subcategory ""Offer"" was visible for every user. If a user wanted to post a new advertisement for the sale of narcotics, they had to write a descriptive advertising text including the requested purchase price according to the defendant's instructions. Additionally, the user had to add one or more pictures showing the offered goods, the name of the seller on the DiDW platform and the current date (so-called trustpics or proofpics). Such advertising text had to be sent to the defendant and activated by the defendant after verification. If the requirements set by the defendant had not yet been met, he first requested the seller to rectify the offer. Only then was the advertising text in the subcategory ""Offer"" visible to the other visitors to the site. The reason behind this was to detect any potential fraudsters, since it was quite common for drug traffickers to place fake ads. The defendant also stated that through his platform DiDW he wanted to create a safe environment for the trafficking in narcotics, so that consumers, just like him, would not be longer exposed to any risks buying narcotics substances on the streets.The ""Offer Verified"" subcategory was created later on, after the ""Offer"" subcategory had been set up. The decisive criterion for activation as a ""verified dealer"" was positive feedback from buyers and the length of time a seller had been active. A verified seller had the possibility to permanently post and edit offers without the interference of the defendant.Neither the users nor the defendant, as was known to each of them, had the required permit to traffic in narcotics or weapons. Between 27 September 2015 and 18 August 2016, the defendant activated at least 15 advertising texts from users for the sale of narcotics. Further, the defendant moved existing advertisements and those previously released by him from the subcategory ""Offer"" to the subcategory ""Offer Verified"" and marked the respective seller as ""Verified Seller"", thus enabling the advertising for the sale of narcotics without the respective required permission.“Weapons”There was no such subcategory for offering weapons within “Marketplace”, only the category “Weapons” itself, set up by the defendant approximately in June 2013 and, according to the description, serving information concerning the manufacture, distribution and proper use of firearms. The category “Weapons” was initially visible to every user. In response to the terrorist attacks in Paris on 13 November 2015, the defendant deactivated the visibility of the subcategory “Weapons” on 27 November 2015 due to the increasing interest of the media in the DiDW platform and in particular due to the suspicion expressed that the weapons used in Paris could have been traded via an “underground forum”. On 2 January 2016 the defendant reactivated the “Weapons” category, which was now visible to registered users only.Within the category “Weapons” users were able to publish posts offering weapons and ammunition or posts requesting certain weapons and ammunition. Contrary to the above-mentioned procedure in the subcategory ""Offer"" for narcotic substances, a separate activation of the offer by the defendant was not required. Rather, every registered user was free to start a new conversation and offer weapons and ammunition for sale or to post a corresponding request within that category. The defendant at least tolerated these actions.In total, by creating the category ""Weapons"", the defendant supported 8 purchase transactions and one exchange transaction of weapons from 11 February 2015 until his provisional arrest in June 2017.Sales transactions between the user “Maurächer” and the user “rico”Through the “Weapons” category on the DiDW platform, the user “Maurächer”, who expressed interest in purchasing a weapon, and the user “rico” got into contact and exchanged information concerning the purchase of a Glock 17. Gen. 4 “rico” possessed. “Maurächer” and “rico” communicated by means of encrypted posts in the encrypted messaging service “Bitmessage”. They agreed on a price and a transaction method and set up a time and place for the handing over of the weapon and EUR 4.000,00 in cash. The user “Maurächer” and the user “rico” finally met on May 20, 2016 and exchanged the money and the Glock 17 Gen. 4 including related ammunition. A few months later “Maurächer” and “rico” met again, as “Maurächer” requested to purchase some more ammunition for a total price of EUR 350.00 from “rico”.  With the acquired Glock 17 Gen. 4, 18 years old ""Maurächer"" carried out a mass shooting at the Olympia shopping center in Munich, Germany on 22 July 2016. Nine people were killed and several injured. The attacker killed himself after the shooting.“rico” (the seller of the weapon) was contacted by undercover agents and arrested in the context of a mock purchase. He was charged with negligent homicide in 9 cases and negligent bodily harm in 5 cases to 7 years imprisonment.The defendant had, at no time, knowledge of the contact and transactions between the user “Maurächer” and the user “rico” since they used encrypted communication channels. Neither was the defendant aware of the intended mass shooting carried out by “Maurächer”. However, he was aware of the fact that the DiDW platform and especially the “weapons” category was mainly used by buyers and sellers to anonymously and illegally offer/purchase weapons and ammunition, as a weapons permit was not required on his platform.The weapon: Glock 17 Gen. 4 caliber 9x19 mm, Individual number: XSH909 including corresponding Sellier & Bellot brand ammunitionThe removed serial-number on the firearm could be made visible again by ballistic experts and it therefore resulted that the weapon originated from the Slovak branch of “Glock”. The weapon was sold via other companies to the Slovak T. company, which re-declared the weapon as a so-called “Flobert gun” (Flobert guns have a relatively low muzzle velocity and can therefore be legally acquired without license in some jurisdictions, including in Slovakia at that time) in order to sell it legally to a purchaser. Via further dealers the weapon finally reached - converted into a live-firing firearm - the DiDW user with the nickname ""Hyena"", who illegally sold it to “rico”. Whether the weapon was actually ever converted into a “Flobert weapon” and when - if this was the case - it was converted back into a live-firing firearm, could not be determined by the investigation.Communication on DiDW mainly took place through the forums, which were accessible to every user and only partially encrypted. In addition, users could communicate by means of the internal messaging function for private messages, which was mandatorily encrypted using the PGP (“Pretty Good Privacy”) standard. Messages older than one month were automatically deleted. The users could further communicate via “Bitmessage” or, in real-time, via a messaging service set up on the basis of “Jabber/XXMP”, which required users to have a separate instant messaging application. The platform further offered an escrow service for transactions on DiDW.The defendant did not receive a share of the profit from the sales on the platform. The use of the escrow service was, likewise, not based on a fee. The platform and the defendant were solely financed by donations in bitcoin. Following an appeal for donations on 24 December 2015, the defendant received EUR 9,850.00.A.U. was charged with aiding the unlawful advertising of narcotics (28 counts), aiding the intentional unlawful trading with a firearm (7 counts), aiding the intentional unlawful acquisition of a semiautomatic handgun (2 counts), and intentional unlawful acquisition of narcotics (4 counts). He was also charged with aiding intentional unlawful trading in a firearm in conjunction with negligent killing (9 counts) in further conjunction with negligent bodily harm (5 counts) in relation to the sale of the weapon used by D.S. to carry out the mass shooting. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years.The parallel proceeding against ""rico"" (the seller of the weapon) can be found here.",drug offences,1
"This case concerns the proceedings of six defendants involved in trafficking illegal goods online. Two so-called Underground Economy forums (UE-forums), d.cc and g.me, were established for the purpose of selling/purchasing illegal goods and exchanging information that could subsequently be used for committing criminal offences. The illegal goods and data available for sale on the forum mainly included drugs, false documents, counterfeit money, and stolen personal data. The forums were accessible by conventional browsers via the Clearnet and could be found using popular search engines. In addition, the forums were accessible by a number of special browsers, such as the TOR-browser, via the darknet.In order to register for the forums, users had to provide an e-mail address and username on the platform and then contact N2 to activate the accounts. In addition to hosting advertisements for illicit goods, both forums provided a platform to exchange information with other users on topics such as anonymization and ways to protect against law enforcement detection and the dissemination of malware. Due to mistrust between the anonymous users, some of the transactions in the forums were concluded via an escrow service for a fee.H., G., and X. had leadership roles on the UEforums. Defendant H. was responsible for the technical aspects of the forums, such as maintaining servers and the security of the forums. He held the positions of administrator, moderator, and trustee, who received fees paid by users of the escrow service. Defendant G. held the position of moderator and was responsible for checking the compliance of users' postings with forum rules and sanctioning users where necessary. He further acted as a trustee for three transactions, sold official documents in one case, and acquired counterfeit money twice. Defendant X. held the position of “super moderator” and mainly provided technical support (e.g., the establishment and maintenance of the technical infrastructure of one of the forums). He also created a “scene guide” which provided users with tips on committing criminal offences as well as information on how to avoid identification by law enforcement officers.

"In October 2020, Yevgeniy Aleksandrovich Nikulin, a Russian national, was sentenced to 88 months’ imprisonment in the United States for hacking into LinkedIn, Dropbox, Formspring, and Automattic, selling the information stolen from the unauthorized access of these companies’ systems (with the exception of Automattic). He was arrested in Prague, Czechia, following an Interpol Red notice, and extradited to the U.S. from Czechia.  He had challenged the Municipal Court of Prague’s decision, as well as the High Court’s rejection of his appeal of the decision, to extradite him to the U.S. in the Czech Constitutional Court. Specially, he filed a constitutional complaint pursuant to the Constitution of Czechia, as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (i.e., the European Convention on Human Rights).A lower court, the Municipal Court in Prague, ruled on the Public Prosecutor Office’s proposal regarding the extradition of the complainant abroad for two criminal prosecutions in different countries pursuant to Section 95 of Act on International Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters (Czechia), as amended.  The Municipal Court ruled that the extradition for both prosecutions was allowed and that the complainant could, therefore, be extradited to the United States (to be prosecuted for unauthorized access to systems and data) and to the Russian Federation (to be prosecuted for the theft of property over the Internet within an organized group). The Municipal Court held that the alleged acts that are the subject of the U.S. and Russian prosecutions were considered crimes under Czech law. The Municipal Court also concluded that the due process rights of the complainant would be respected in both countries. From the materials provided by the foreign authorities, the Municipal Court held that the extradition was not prohibited under Section 91 of the Act on International Judicial Cooperation. Additionally, according to the Municipal Court, the complainant was a young, healthy man, and it could not be assumed that his extradition would cause him disproportionate harm.It is important to note that the complainant did not object to his extradition to the Russian Federation. The complainant objected his extradition to the United States. The Municipal Court did not find any reason to object to the extradition of the complainant to the United States. Furthermore, the Municipal Court held that the complainant’s objection to the extradition to the United States, specifically, on the grounds that he would be subjected to a disproportionate penalty were unfounded, especially since in the U.S. sentences for several crimes could be served concurrently.The complainant appealed the decision of the Municipal Court to the High Court in Prague. After reviewing the decision of the Municipal Court and the evidence presented by the complainant, the High Court rejected the appeal and similarly found that there were no grounds for prohibiting the extradition of the complainant. The High Court echoed many of the conclusions of the Municipal Court, concluding that there were no facts presented that illustrated the risk of ​​human rights violations and disproportionate sentencing of the complainant if he was to be extradited to the United States. In fact, in regard to the latter, the High Court rejected the complainant’s argument that he was at risk of receiving a penalty of up to 54 years’ imprisonment in the United States. In rejecting this claim, the High Court noted that the penalty he could receive for the alleged crimes ranged between 12 to 14 years’ imprisonment.The Constitutional Court held that the decisions of the Municipal Court and High Court met constitutional requirements and rejected the complaint of the applicant as manifestly unfounded. Ultimately, when Mr. Nikulin was extradited to the United States and tried by a jury, he received a sentence of 7 years and 4 months’ imprisonment for his cybercrimes. He was sentenced for selling stolen usernames and passwords, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(2); installing malware on protected computers, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5); conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; computer intrusion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)(C); and aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(1).",cybercrime,0

With the exception of one company, which provided its identity to the offender for a bribe, none of the associated companies were aware of the abuse of their company details. The construction work of the trafficked persons (total of 22 people) was performed from Monday to Saturday, 7am to 6pm with an hour break for lunch, but they often worked on Sundays from 7am to 1pm as well. The offender did not conclude written employment agreements with the trafficked persons and did not pay for their social security and health insurance. Instead of the promised wages of 150 CZK per hour he paid the persons a total of 150 CZK per day, stating that he would pay them the remainder of the wages in the future. When the persons refused to work, they were threatened by the offender with physical violence, which in some cases actually occurred. The personal documents were also taken from the workers. The offender committed the said conduct at least from the beginning of 2007 until April 2009 and allegedly achieved a net profit of over 11 million CZK through such conduct. There were two other accused offenders who engaged the trafficked persons in other jobs. These accused persons performed the supervision of the trafficked persons at the instruction of the principal accused person, through their accommodation and employment activities; they were also responsible for the record-keeping of the employees and daily distribution of the daily payment of 150 CZK. The victims found themselves in distress by the fact that they lacked any place to stay and had no steady source of income. In addition to the distressful situation, the accused also used deceit by misleading the trafficked persons – persons coming from socially disadvantaged environments – regarding the income conditions that the accused intended to provide them with. The accused used such deceit not only to negotiate new employees, but also to retain the existing workforce when in the event of non-payment of wages he used the secondary insolvency as an excuse despite the fact that all of his invoices for the performed work were paid. The accused thus through these false assertions put the trafficked persons also in a dependency. The dependency in workers was also induced by removing the personal documents of the trafficked persons, which particularly restricted the movement of the foreign nationals from their place of work. The court imposed the punishment by prison judgments of ten years to the main perpetrator, which however was subsequently reduced under the appellate proceedings to prison judgments of eight years and six months. The principal accused was also imposed the punishment of forfeiture of their personal vehicle Mercedes-Benz ML 320 CDI 4-Matic. However, this judgment was subsequently revoked by the Supreme Court under the appellate proceedings. According to the court it was not demonstrated that the car in question was purchased from the proceeds of criminal activity. One of the co-accused was sentenced to a prison judgment of four years, while the second co-defendant was sentenced to a prison judgment of three years, with the conditional suspension for the period of four years.The conviction came into the full force and effect on 15 May 2012 and thus it became the first ever conviction in human trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitation in the Czech Republic.",trafficking in persons,1

"In October 2020, Yevgeniy Aleksandrovich Nikulin, a Russian national, was sentenced to 88 months’ imprisonment in the United States for hacking into LinkedIn, Dropbox, Formspring, and Automattic, selling the information stolen from the unauthorized access of these companies’ systems (with the exception of Automattic). He was arrested in Prague, Czechia, following an Interpol Red notice, and extradited to the U.S. from Czechia.  He had challenged the Municipal Court of Prague’s decision, as well as the High Court’s rejection of his appeal of the decision, to extradite him to the U.S. in the Czech Constitutional Court. Specially, he filed a constitutional complaint pursuant to the Constitution of Czechia, as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (i.e., the European Convention on Human Rights).A lower court, the Municipal Court in Prague, ruled on the Public Prosecutor Office’s proposal regarding the extradition of the complainant abroad for two criminal prosecutions in different countries pursuant to Section 95 of Act on International Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters (Czechia), as amended.  The Municipal Court ruled that the extradition for both prosecutions was allowed and that the complainant could, therefore, be extradited to the United States (to be prosecuted for unauthorized access to systems and data) and to the Russian Federation (to be prosecuted for the theft of property over the Internet within an organized group). The Municipal Court held that the alleged acts that are the subject of the U.S. and Russian prosecutions were considered crimes under Czech law. The Municipal Court also concluded that the due process rights of the complainant would be respected in both countries. From the materials provided by the foreign authorities, the Municipal Court held that the extradition was not prohibited under Section 91 of the Act on International Judicial Cooperation. Additionally, according to the Municipal Court, the complainant was a young, healthy man, and it could not be assumed that his extradition would cause him disproportionate harm.It is important to note that the complainant did not object to his extradition to the Russian Federation. The complainant objected his extradition to the United States. The Municipal Court did not find any reason to object to the extradition of the complainant to the United States. Furthermore, the Municipal Court held that the complainant’s objection to the extradition to the United States, specifically, on the grounds that he would be subjected to a disproportionate penalty were unfounded, especially since in the U.S. sentences for several crimes could be served concurrently.The complainant appealed the decision of the Municipal Court to the High Court in Prague. After reviewing the decision of the Municipal Court and the evidence presented by the complainant, the High Court rejected the appeal and similarly found that there were no grounds for prohibiting the extradition of the complainant. The High Court echoed many of the conclusions of the Municipal Court, concluding that there were no facts presented that illustrated the risk of ​​human rights violations and disproportionate sentencing of the complainant if he was to be extradited to the United States. In fact, in regard to the latter, the High Court rejected the complainant’s argument that he was at risk of receiving a penalty of up to 54 years’ imprisonment in the United States. In rejecting this claim, the High Court noted that the penalty he could receive for the alleged crimes ranged between 12 to 14 years’ imprisonment.The Constitutional Court held that the decisions of the Municipal Court and High Court met constitutional requirements and rejected the complaint of the applicant as manifestly unfounded. Ultimately, when Mr. Nikulin was extradited to the United States and tried by a jury, he received a sentence of 7 years and 4 months’ imprisonment for his cybercrimes. He was sentenced for selling stolen usernames and passwords, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(2); installing malware on protected computers, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5); conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; computer intrusion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(2)(C); and aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(1).",participation in organized criminal group,0

"Mustapha and his conspirators gained access to seven different 401(k) retirement accounts using confidential customer identity information.

Defendant 2 did not have a decisive influence over Victim 1 and was convicted of Gross Procuring.",trafficking in persons,0
"The Victims were two young Romanian women who had been misled to come to Sweden. Defendant 1 sought after women for prostitution in Sweden through internet advertisements. The advertisement stated that food, transportation and accommodation would be free of charge and that the women would receive a salary of EUR 6,000 per month. Victim 1 saw the advertisement in the Spring 2011 and contacted Defendant 1 to confirm the salary. Defendant 1 confirmed that the salary was EUR 6,000 per month and that prostitution would only be carried out at a nightclub. In late May 2011, when Victim 1 and Victim 2 decided to go to Sweden, Defendant 1 bought bus tickets for them from Bucharest to Helsingborg.

The four men were convicted of Human Trafficking by the District Court.The Court of Appeal changed the sentence for the four men and convicted them of Gross Procuring since the four men had not been in control of Victim 1 in such a way that she did not have any realistic or acceptable alternative than to be subjected to the will of the four men. Victim 1 also denied that she was under the control of the defendants and she denied the help offered by the police as protected housing and money for a ticket home and instead wanted to stay in the apartment where she had been living. When the expulsion of Victim 1 was carried out, she had money to exchange before the journey home, she wanted to hand over the keys to the apartment by herself to the tenant of the apartment, Defendant 7, that she referred to as her boyfriend and had an identity document that enabled her to travel back to Romania.

"The District Court of Stockholm sentenced five men and one woman of varying involvement in prostitution. They had conveyed to the purchasers of sex in relation to six Baltic women, who in some cases have been led into prostitution in Sweden. The District Court of Stockholm found that it is to be considered gross procuring utilizing a newly operated and under-aged prostitute.

"RG was the Dominican Consul in Cap-Haïtien, Haiti who, shortly after being elected to the Dominican Congress, was charged with facilitating the illegal entry of 14 Chinese nationals into the Dominican Republic. Three other men, RS, NC and CS, were also charged in relation to the entry of the Chinese nationals. RG had been contacted at his consular headquarters in Haiti by NC and CS who persuaded him to transfer 14 Chinese nationals from China to the Dominican Republic. RG issued tourist cards to the 16 foreigners (the 14 Chinese nationals, and NC and CS). In early June 2002, RG drove in a Jeep through Haiti to the border of the Dominican Republic with the foreign nationals following behind him in a bus. From a hotel in Haiti, RG made a phone call to the supervisor of migration and customs at the border, RS, informing him that he would be arriving late at the border and that he wanted the border to remain open for his arrival. RS acceded to RG’s request and kept the border open. At approximately 7:30pm of the day in question, RG arrived at the border. The busload of Chinese nationals following RG came as a surprise to RS. Mr RG informed him that he had brought with him foreign investors. Dominican law provided that Chinese nationals could only enter the Dominican Republic with a visa, issued with the prior express authorization of the Dominican Chancellery. Because it was so late, authorization to enter the Dominican Republic could not be obtained. RG used his status as consul in Haiti to persuade RS to allow the group to enter the Dominican Republic anyway. RS agreed, but kept hold of the passports of the Chinese nationals as a precautionary measure. RG promised that the group would stay in Dajabón, the town closest to the border with Haiti, and that they would return the next day to obtain authorizations to enter the country and collect their passports. Instead, RG took the group to the city of Santiago, almost 150 km from Dajabón. He returned alone the next day to pick up the passports. After returning to the border, migration officials at the border crossing made a complaint about RG to the police and he was arrested. Following his arrest, RG was dismissed as consul to Haiti. NC and CS were subsequently arrested. In the possession of NC Dominican authorities found 14 envelopes containing sums of between $2,500 and $3,000 (the particular currency is not specified in court documents, but is presumably USD), payment for the entry into the Dominican Republic of each of the Chinese nationals. Legal Findings:On 10 July 2002, the Director of the Department of Corruption Prevent in the Dominican Republic processed a report on the smuggling of migrants from China to the Dominican Republic. The report had been drafted following an investigation by the Attorney-General and the General Directorate of Migration. The report recommended that RG, NC and CS be charged with facilitating illegal entry. It also recommended that the Supervisor of Customs at the border who had allowed the group of Chinese nationals through the border without visas, RS, also be charged with facilitating illegal entry. On 12 July 2002, the Attorney-General of the Dominican Republic authorized the Attorney-General of the Judicial District of Dajabón to investigate the matter. The Attorney-General of the Judicial District of Dajabón then authorized the Judge of Instruction of the Judicial District of Dajabón to issue a criminal indictment against the four men. The Judge of Instruction of the Judicial District of Dajabón interrogated the four men, as well as several witnesses, but could not continue with the case because by this time RG had been elected to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Congress of the Dominican Republic, as Deputy for La Vega. Article 67 of the Dominican Constitution provides that the Supreme Court of Justice of the Dominican Republic shall have the exclusive jurisdiction to hear criminal cases against Deputies and other senior public officials. The case was transferred to the Supreme Court of Justice when Mr García commenced his term as deputy on 16 August 2002. After numerous delays, on 5 March 2005 the Supreme Court of Justice handed down its decision on the four men. RG, NC and CS were all found guilty of the charge of facilitating illegal entry. RS was acquitted of the charge of facilitating illegal entry. RG was acquitted of an additional charge of extortion.",other crimes,0
"In 20 October 2011, the Deputy Public Prosecutor of San Cristobal Province filed charges against JR, alleging that JR had organized and captained migrant smuggling ventures from the Dominican Republic to the United States of America.JR sailed the smuggled migrants in a yola from the Port of Haina to the high seas where they were then transferred to a barge. The smuggled migrants then hid in the barge until they arrived to the US. For this, JR received significant sums of money, which he shared with his assistant, AS. This case concerns only one such smuggling venture.At 6am on 6 March 2011, JR, assisted by AS, departed the beach of Nigua on board of a yola carrying three Dominican nationals from Haina. JR planned to intercept an American flagged barge, 'Crinson Tide', which would take the smuggled migrants to Miami, Florida. For smuggling to the US, JR charged the smuggled migrants DOP 30,000 each, which they were to pay before boarding the Crinson Tide.Before intercepting the Crinson Tide, JR's yola capsized on the high seas. JR and AS were able to swim to shore at Palenque. The three smuggled migrants could not swim and drowned.On 8 March 2011, JR was found on the coast of the Dominican Republic by members of the Dominican Navy. Upon finding JR, the Navy commenced an extensive search and rescue operation to find the smuggled migrants. This operation was unsuccessful. The bodies of the three smuggled migrants have never been found.On 11 March 2011, JR's yola was found empty in the area of Los Almendros. JR was arrested. Meanwhile, AS fled. AS was arrested several weeks later.JR was initially held in pre-trial custody, but was later granted bail. While released on bail, JR fled the Dominican Republic for Italy. An INTERPOL Red Notice was issued for his arrest. In March 2013, JR was arrested by Interpol in Reggio Emilia, Italy. A request for his extradition was processed by the Dominican Attorney General's Department of International Legal Assistance and Extraditions on 1 April 2013 and on 8 May 2013 Italian authorities ordered JR's extradition.Legal findings:After being tried for the offense of illicit traffic of migrants in the Dominican Republic, JR was convicted and sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. Several appeals against his conviction were unsuccessful. AS was also convicted of offenses related to his role in the migrant smuggling venture, and was sentenced to five years imprisonment.",smuggling of migrants,1

"CM was the leader of a criminal organization that facilitated the illegal entry into Chile from the Dominican Republic of more than 44 people, mostly Dominican nationals, on 10 different occasions between 4 February 2013 and 2 August 2013. Chilean newspapers later reported that the organized criminal group was responsible for the illegal entry of 83 smuggled migrants, mainly Dominicans and Colombians. CM, along with her husband, DM, operated a travel agency in San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic, called ‘Sky Travel’ and recruited and engaged the smuggled migrants. She purportedly charged them between USD 2,000 and 2,500 for an airfare from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, to Santiago, Chile, and a visa for entry into Chile. In reality, she arranged for the migrants to be smuggled from the Dominican Republic to Chile. CM never applied for any of the visas her clients believed they were paying for. By the time the smuggled migrants realized that they were not being brought into Chile legally, they were often far from home, with little money, and at the mercy of their handlers. Through her travel agency, CM provided the smuggled migrants with tickets to fly from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, to Bogota, Colombia or La Paz, Plurinational State of Bolivia. For those smuggled migrants that were flown to Colombia, they then had to travel overland through Ecuador and Peru before reaching the Plurinational State of Bolivia. The smuggled migrants then travelled through the Plurinational State of Bolivia to the border town of Pisiga. Sometimes smuggled migrants would be left in Pisiga for days while awaiting the next leg of the travel. In Pisiga, some migrants suffered altitude sickness. From Pisiga, they clandestinely travelled by land across the border towards the Chilean town of Colcrane, often at night, and sometimes in extreme temperatures. This journey included a crossing of the Atacama Desert. RS coordinated and executed the land crossings of the smuggled migrants between the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Chile, and helped evade border controls in the region. Sometimes the crossings were carried out using vehicles, but other times they were completed on foot. The journey was quite dangerous to the lives and safety of the smuggled migrants. RS would leave the smuggled migrants in the Atacama Desert in the vicinity of Colcrane. Smuggled migrants were not given adequate food and accommodation and suffered fevers, dizziness, vomiting and exposure to the cold. The danger to the smuggled migrants in this crossing was particularly extreme because the Atacama Desert had been landmined in the 1970s and 1980s. Near Colcrane, the smuggled migrants would be met by a vehicle which would take them to the city of Iquique, Chile. This vehicle would be driven by HM, who took backroads and had the migrants exit the van when they had to through control points of the Chilean Carabineros (the national police foce). HM was also supported in the smuggling enterprise by his father, MG, who provided the van used to transfer the smuggled migrants to Iquique. The men that brought the smuggled migrants to Iquique reportedly demanded further payment from them. The ventures included the smuggling of one Dominican woman on 4 February 2013, another Dominican woman on 21 February 2013, three Dominican women on 14 March 2013, eight Dominican women and five Dominican men on 21 March 2013, two Dominican persons on 30 March 2013, approximately eleven foreigners on 4 May 2013, and approximately ten foreigners, including eight Dominicans, on 11 June 2013. In addition, two other men in CM’s smuggling network, CAM and ARM, who were brothers, were apprehended bringing 42 smuggled migrants, hidden inside a tanker truck, in July 2013. CM became a person of interest to Chilean authorities after they interviewed a number of undocumented migrants apprehended in Chile. Multiple migrants identified CM as having misled them as to the nature and legality of their travel to Chile. The Chilean Government requested the extradition of CM to face migrant smuggling charges through diplomatic notes issued to the Dominican Government between 14 August 2013 and 18 October 2013. On 3 December 2013, two Dominican police squads, accompanied by public prosecutors, raided CM’s home in San Cristóbal and the offices of Sky Travel. CM was arrested. On 9 June 2014, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Dominican Republic ordered that the extradition to Chile should proceed and on 18 July 2014 the President of the Dominican Republic ordered CM’s extradition to Chile. She was duly extradited on 26 September 2014.  While Chilean authorities sought the extradition of both CM and her husband, DM, as at 9 February 2016 DM was still at large and had not been apprehended. Further information about the criminal proceedings against any of the other members of CM’s smuggling organization was unavailable at the time of writing.",smuggling of migrants,1

"The Defendant, Faisal Alam, was accused of trafficking 4 Bangladeshi nationals from Bangladesh into Seychelles between 2015 and 2016. It was alleged that he recruited them by misrepresenting the financial incentive and conditions of work, and thereafter exploiting the victims by forced labour and practices similar to slavery. Defendant is a Bangladeshi national who was then residing in Mahe, Seychelles and held a GOP (Gainful Occupation Permit) as Director of Dove Alliance Ltd., a construction firm.  While still in Bangladesh, Defendant’s brother Marsud Alam told the victims that they could work as carpenters in Seychelles with a salary of 500 USD per month and that they would be provided with food and lodging. The victims paid Marsud 5,000-6,000 USD for their recruitment. Marsud then gave them their GOPs and returned 3,000 USD in cash to be given to the Defendant. The Defendant received the workers upon arrival in Seychelles, collected the cash and took their passports. The workers were lodged in unfinished houses which they were made to work on after a whole day of carpentry work for third party Dove Alliance clients. The victims lived in deplorable conditions (i.e. kitchen and toilet we the same). The amount of food given to them was not enough and they were not paid their salaries for some months. When they asked the defendant about the lack of payment, food and proper accommodation, he threatened to send them back to Bangladesh or kill them. The officials of the Department of Employment, upon receipt of complaints that expatriate workers for Dove Alliance were being mistreated, initiated investigation and found enough evidence of human trafficking to refer the matter to the police. The officials identified the following indicators of human trafficking using the UNODC Human Trafficking Index: - the defendant had confiscated the passports of his workers- the workers were reluctant to answer the questions of the officers- one of the workers stated that the defendant threatened their family members in Bangladesh if they were to report him to the authorities - workers were constantly moved from one site to another, making it difficult for them to know their address - workers on site were reluctant to answer the questions of the officers and gave the officers the number of the accused - workers were not supplied with personal protective equipment - workers had not received salary for some months- upon inquiry about necessary equipment or salary, workers were threatened to be sent back home- 3 out of 4 accommodations for workers were far below the standard requirements of public health authorities.",trafficking in persons,1
"The investigation proceedings were initiated by an official letter (number 233/E4/DICT/CA/17), dated July 31, 2017, signed by the Chief Inspector CESV, Head of the Transnational Criminal Investigation Division of the National Civil Police, in which it is established that he has received information from FBM from the ICE Agency of the American Embassy based in El Salvador; the information was sent to Mr. FBM by email from the Office of National Security of the United States, Immigration and Customs Control based in Guatemala City.In the report, Mr. FBM., states that on July 19, 2017, the Office of National Security of the United States, Immigration and Customs Control of Guatemala delivered by email to the Office of National Security of the United States, Immigration and Customs Control in El Salvador, a report from the Guatemalan Public Ministry entitled ""Information on the ALERTA CENTRO AMERICA Case"" and attaches two reports containing an investigation conducted in the Republic of Guatemala on a transnational network that could be involved in the dissemination of child pornography, human trafficking and the production of child pornography in El Salvador.When carrying out the final count of users within the investigated cases, a total of 13 telephone numbers were found.Following this information, it was requested to carry out the necessary investigations in order to fully identify the people who are responsible for the crimes of “use of girls, boys, adolescents or people with disabilities in pornography through information and communication technologies” provided for and sanctioned in article 29 of the Special Law against Cyber Crime and Related Crimes and the crime of Trafficking in Persons sanctioned in Art. 54 of the Special Law against Human Trafficking. It was also requested to carry out Investigations to locate and verify the property or buildings where a minor could have been possibly sexually exploited, the logs of the thirteen telephone numbers as well as the location of the antennas and/or their activation, with respect to the thirteen number of telephones that contain the code of El Salvador.Additionally, in a report delivered on September 7, 2017, in Guatemala City by the Public Ministry of Guatemala, Prosecutor's Office against Trafficking in Persons, it is stated that in the evidence analyzed, images of explicit sexual content were found, showing people who appear to be underage. Therefore, due to the nature of the crime under investigation, and the evidence that more than one person has access to the property from which the child pornography images were downloaded, it is necessary to register all cell phones and computer equipment inside each of the properties, and to seize the material containing images of sexual abuse of girls, boys, and adolescents, if they were found. Consequently, carry out the relevant investigations at the place of registration, in order to scientifically establish who was the person who downloaded said material from the Internet and achieve the full identification of the people who had access to the place where the electronic mass storage devices (i.e. cell phones, desktop and laptop computers, tablets, iPad, USB memory, SD memory, removable hard drives, DVD, cameras and any other electronic device from which pornographic image downloads originated) have been found.

"The following are the facts set forth in the complaint:Victim was a 14 year old child. Her mother abandoned her at approximately age 6, whereupon she lived with her abusive alcoholic father for two years. From there, she moved in with an aunt who left her alone when the aunt moved to the United States. On her own, she was approached with an offer of work to do household chores for another woman (i.e., the Accused). The victim accepted the offer.When she arrived at the place of work, the Accused told her she would clean and sell beer for a monthly wage of $50. She learned that a second female working at the establishment, Maribel Rosa, worked as a prostitute, charging between $30 and $50 for intercourse with men from the United States. When Maribel Rosa left for Mexico, the Accused made the Victim have sex with the men that came. The Accused negotiated the rate and the Victim received $10 to $25 per instance.The Accused negotiated with a man named Beto to take the child to a new hotel where he had sex with her. The man drove a Jaguar, an expensive car. In the morning, when he was driving her back to the Accused’s place of business, he was stopped at a checkpoint. When asked, the Victim claimed that Beto was her uncle but was unable to say his last name.Beto’s car was impounded. He carried Mexican papers but was a Salvadoran national. He was arrested and charged with rape; the Victim was sent to ISNA for treatment. However, prior to being sent to ISNA, the Accused came to the police station seeking release of the Victim to her. First she claimed that the Victim was her niece or cousin, but was unable to prove this. Then, she said the Victim was her employee. The day of the incident was approximately 18 May 2008. The Accused was arrested three days later at her place of business.The evidence presented at trial primarily concerned the circumstances surrounding the arrest of Beto and the fact that he had sex with the Victim. Reference is made that one of the officers providing testimony also testified at Beto’s rape trial. Because of the lack of relevant evidences, the court found that the prosecution failed to satisfy any of the elements of human trafficking by the Accused and the Accused was accordingly acquitted.",other crimes,0
"A woman known only as “Tía” delivered the Victim from Honduras to El Salvador to work at a bar owned by the accused Peraza. Tía induced the victim to accompany her to El Salvador by promising her a job as a waitress. Upon arrival at the place where the victim was to work, a night club called “El Conejo Feliz,” Tía instructed the Victim that she was to have sex with men there for $10 and give $2 to Peraza for each instance, and, if Peraza was not there, to give the $2 to the accused J.E..J.E. provided the Victim with alcohol and the Victim had intercourse with approximately 5 men daily. The victim left after approximately 3-4 months to Honduras. There is no mention of whether she had been prevented from leaving or how it was that she came to leave.  Approximately 2 months later, Peraza went to the Victim’s home in Honduras and brought her back to El Salvador to work off an alleged outstanding debt. It is unclear whether any additional coercion was employed to induce her to return to El Conejo Feliz.The same month the Victim returned to El Conejo Feliz, police received a report of a minor engaging in prostitution there while intoxicated.  Police went to investigate. There they found the Victim, who claimed she was 17, and administered an alcohol test that determined she was intoxicated. The police sent the Victim to a center for safekeeping and arrested Peraza and J.E. on 2 or 12 September 2007 (the judgment is internally inconsistent as to the date of arrest). There is no mention of whether they sought out the woman known as Tía.In the judgment, reference is made to deposition testimony of the Victim, which the court credits, but the listing of testimonial evidence presented at the trial does not include testimony by the victim.",other crimes,1

"Date(s) of offending: on/from 12 January 2012.The defendant was arrested and accused of migrant smuggling. He was deemed to have attempted to guide two adult males to Mexico and, from there, to the United States.One of the migrants declared to have contacted the defendant requesting his assistance. Precisely, he and his brother wished to travel to, and enter, the United States illegally. They needed the guidance of the defendant to that effect. The defendant agreed in exchange of the payment of 10 000 USD. The migrant answered not to have such an amount of cash with him. Thus, the defendant led him to a notary’s office where they celebrated a contract for the purchase of a house allegedly belonging to the defendant. The migrant delivered to the defendant a check for 9 600 USD and 400 USD in cash. Consequently, on 19 January 2012, both subsidiary migrants in the proceedings (brothers), a third individual not identified, and the defendant initiated the journey to the United States, via Mexico. However, once arriving to Tuxtla Gutiérrez (Mexico), migration authorities uncovered the smuggling venture and deported the individuals to El Salvador. On 31 January 2012, the same migrant (this time not in the company of his brother) and the defendant attempted the travel again. They managed to enter the United States. Yet, on his way to Houston, Texas (United States), the migrant had a traffic accident. Authorities thus unveiled his irregular situation in the country and, once more, deported him to El Salvador. Again, the victim attempted to retry the journey to the United States and searched the assistance of the defendant to that effect. The latter did not do so and did not return the 10 000 USD initially received. The migrant argued to have lost 4 800 USD in interests in addition to the 10 000 USD paid for the smuggling journey. The brother of the migrant referred to above corroborated the facts as described supra. He added he delivered 2000 USD to the defendant. When he was deported from Mexico, he gave up the plan and requested the return of the money paid to the defendant. The latter refused and threatened to kill him and his family. This version of events was confirmed by documental evidence provided by the Department of Migration Control of the Ministry of Security and Public Defence, which revealed the migratory movements of the defendant and subsidiary migrants. Throughout the smuggling venture, the defendant instructed the victims on how to react when dealing with authorities so as to ensure the crossing of borders, and paid for their accommodation. He also humiliated the migrants-to-be (psychologically and physically), having made them starve and suffer insults in silence. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied on testimonial and documental evidence.Legal findingsThe defendant was convicted of migrant smuggling in first instance. The decision was upheld on appeal.For further details see  “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,0
"On 1 March 2014, in the context of a regular patrol in the border zone of Las Chinamas (El Salvador), the national police signaled a minibus to stop. Amongst the passengers were found the defendant in company of the potential subsidiary victim (minor) in these proceedings. The latter stated (i) not to possess an identification document, (ii) to be in his journey to the United States. He further identified the defendant as the person guiding him in his endeavor. The defendant was hence arrested. The minor’s mother had allegedly taken him to San Salvador (El Salvador), where he took a bus to Ahuachapan (El Salvador). He would have met there the defendant. The latter was supposed to make him cross the border through an unattended site. Coincidentally, the police stopped the minibus precisely in front of a small, slightly hidden, path that led to a border-crossing point not controlled by authorities. The certificate of inspection of the site of occurrence of the facts, as redacted on 2 March 2014, confirmed the traffic control operation took place very close to the afore-mentioned track.The police officer that had stopped and searched the vehicle stated the migrant-to-be appeared particularly nervous, which raised suspicions and led him to question him more in detail. He declared not to remember the name of the migrant-to-be and was able to describe the person accompanying him merely as wearing a “Barcelona t-shirt”. He added he was named as the defendant.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence. Legal findingsThe Criminal Court of Ahuachapán (El Salvador) acquitted the defendant of the crime of migrant smuggling.For further details see  “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,0
"Date(s) of offending: On/from: 4 March 2014 to 4 March 2014On 4 March 2014, the migrant-to-be (subsidiary victims in these proceedings) and the defendant crossed into El Salvador from Guatemala via the border post of La Hachadura (El Salvador). The migrant-to-be declared that he and the defendant were simply visiting El Salvador and that the defendant was paying for the costs of travel. The defendant had legally crossed the border into El Salvador and had instructed the migrant-to-be to cross the border through an unattended location since he did not have the necessary documentation to the effect. After crossing the border, both individuals took a bus, which was inspected by police in the course of a traffic control operation. The defendant was then detained. He had in his possession inter alia 6100 USD, 210000 Colombian Pesos, 2500 Mexican Pesos.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, from the migrant-to-be and the police officers involved in the detection of the crime and detention of the defendant. Documental evidence was also considered, especially in order to assess the connections of the defendant with El Salvador and the risk that he could escape justice if released.Legal findingsThe competent Investigative Judge replaced the remand in custody with alternative measures less onerous on personal freedom. On appeal, such decision was revoked and the precautionary detention of the defendant was re-ordered.For further details see  “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,0
"Date(s) of offending: On/from 4 February 2014 to 5 February 2014.On 5 February 2014, a minor and her daughter were detected in the border point of La Hachadura (El Salvador) while they attempted to cross the border, with the purpose of illegally entering the United States via Mexico. They did not hold the necessary documentation to the effect. For this reason, the mother would have resorted to the services of the defendant so that the latter could organize and guide her throughout the smuggling venture. She addressed the defendant as he would have “assisted” already some of her friends. She explained that her ex-boyfriend (gang member) had been submitting her to abuse and threatening to take her child away from her. A friend residing in the United States had sent money to pay for the smuggling venture to one of her friends (since herself, being a minor, could not withdraw money from the bank alone). After receiving the cash from her friend, the migrant-to-be passed it to her aunt, who in turn paid the smuggler (the defendant), in the presence of her husband and the migrant-to-be herself. Once all details had been agreed upon, the migrant-to-be, her daughter and the defendant caught a bus, on 4 February 2014, to Santa Tecla (El Salvador), where they slept in a hotel. The following day, they caught another bus to Sonsonate (El Salvador). From there, they followed to La Hachadura. The defendant paid for accommodation, food and transportation.The subsidiary victim further declared that once they had arrived to the border post of La Hachadura, she and her daughter separated from the smuggler. The latter would have carried the luggage of the child. She added she knew the defendant merely as Don C. The migrant-to-be was questioned by authorities when the latter perceived her young age, which raised suspicions. She initially declared to be on site simply to visit an aunt residing in La Hachadura. Later, she reported the facts as detailed supra.The defendant charged 10000 USD for his services: 6000 to be paid before initiating the travel and 4000 USD once reaching the United States.The defendant was detained in peculiar circumstances. That is, authorities did not immediately trace him. Rather, approximately four hours later, a minibus was randomly stopped and inspected. The defendant was detained as he matched the characteristics described by the migrant-to-be, even though he was not in possession of the child’s belongings.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, from the (i) migrant-to-be, and (ii) police officers involved in the detection of the crime and detention of the defendant. Documental evidence was also considered, notably the protocol of arrest. Importantly, the friend and aunt of the migrant-to-be had not been heard thus far.Legal findingsThe Magistrate’s Court of San Francisco Menéndez (El Salvador) denied the petition of the Public Prosecution for the imposition of remand in custody. Instead, it applied a number of alternative precautionary measures less onerous upon the personal freedom of the defendant: (i) obligation to present himself before the court at regular intervals, (ii) prohibition to leave the country, (iii) prohibition to communicate with the subsidiary victims/witnesses, and (iv) bail. The appeal of the Public Prosecution was dismissed. For further details see  “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,0

The purpose was to smuggle the two individuals into Guatemala and later the United States. The migrants-to-be did not possess the necessary documentation to the effect.When questioned in La Hachadura, the migrants-to-be admitted to the smuggling venture and identified the defendants as the smugglers. Later on, they retracted their statements. Notably, one of them maintained his initial declarations to police had been based on the fear of being detained. He also mentioned that the defendants were paying for the costs of the travel since they were “family friends”. Initially though, he had declared that a friend residing in Houston, Texas (United States of America) had paid the defendants for their role in the smuggling venture. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, from the migrants-to-be and the police officers involved in the detection of the crime and detention of the defendants. The non-identification of the defendants in a line-up was central in the case.Legal findingsThe competent Investigative Judge revoked the remand in custody of the defendants.

All of them had been working as sex workers under the control of a man known to the Court as “Darren”.At the time the girls appeared to be destitute with no place to go. Defendant Inoke took them for dinner followed by a party with drinks at his motel room. At the party they discussed the sex business, fees, the splitting of fees for commission, and he asked them to work for him. They agreed. However, when Darren heard that “his girls” had gone with the defendant, he started texting him, making threats and demanding to know where they were.Inoke kept the two younger sisters at the Elixir Motel for 2-3 months, where they provided sexual services for clients that he arranged. At first he received a commission from the fees paid by customers, but later he demanded to keep all of the money for himself, which the girls gave to him in return for their ""keep"". That keep consisted of the room charges being paid, food, entertainment by way of drugs and alcohol, beautification and nice clothes and shoes. The defendant referred to these expenses as investments to make his ""products"" -as he referred to them- more attractive. The girls came from a dysfunctional family where the parents were separated and the father was an alcoholic.When the clients became scarce and the expenses too high, Inoke moved operations from the motel room to a flat he rented at Raiwai.

Hence, it can not be alleged that she was prompted by any ulterior motives to speak against the accused; for which reason her testimony must be held to be true.On the second point the court held that the evidence on record does not bring out evidence sufficient to fix the complicity of the accused in the offence punishable under Section 3 of ITP Act.On the third point the court held Section 4 of ITP Act makes the act of any person over the age of 18 years living wholly or in part, on the earnings of prostitution of any person punishable. The evidence of PW 2 would amply prove that she was led into prostitution by A1 and A2. There can be no other reason that can be read into the facts of the case other than the monetary benefit. The charge under Section 5 of ITP Act was also proven against the accused.The defence counsel sought to discredit the testimony of the victim, by stating that the prosecution was unable to prove that the victim had stayed in the house of A2. The court stated in its judgment that facts of the case would project a clear situation where no independent witnesses would come forward to give evidence. The failure of the police in not explaining about their efforts to secure independent witnesses cannot at any rate prejudice the victim. When the case itself stands on highly credible facts calling for independent evidence would result in a hyper technical approach, which is not warranted.The defence counsel also sought to shatter the credibility of the NGO and PW 1. The court stated that the mere fact that the organisation of PW 1 is run by the funds which are provided to it based on the number of victims catered by it can not be taken to infer that every act of it is motivated by the said benefit. Hence the suggestion that PW 1 has shown PW 2 as a member of their rescue home in order to raise funds is simply ridiculous.On the fourth point the court held that the evidence of the victim clearly shows that A2 apart from using her as a tool for prostitution had also used her as a tool to satisfy his own lust. The testimony of the victim as true was held in the first point itself. Hence, charge of A2 raping the victim had been proved.Having found the accused guilty on several counts, the court sentenced A1 and A2 as described below.",other crimes,1
"This petition was filed before High Court of Calcutta against conviction of 2 accused (husband and wife) in Sessions Trial. The first accused, Foyam Sk., was sentenced to Rigorous Imprisonment for eight (8) years each and to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000/- (in default, to suffer Rigorous Imprisonment for further two (2) months) on two counts under Sections 363A and 366A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The second accused, Samina Bibi although found guilty, was let off on probation under the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958. In order to countenance the situation arising out of the post-conviction stage the appellants preferred the appeal on several grounds.The facts of the case are that M, the child victim, was sent by her mother (who had been divorced by her husband) to work as a domestic help in the house of the accused. Under pretension of getting the victim married, the accused took her for a tour to Saudi Arabia, where she was forced to beg for alms and was put through forced prostitution. The victim retrieved herself somehow and surrendered to the Saudi Arabian Police from where she was deported to India and subsequently was placed in a children’s home.After legally analyzing the entire case on the basis of available facts and evidence, the High Court upheld the conviction and sentence of the first accused, Foyam Sk. Regarding the second accused Samina Bibi, the High Court set-aside the order of probation of the trial court. The court held that in view of the depraved nature of the crime it was wholly unjustified to extend the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act to such an accused. Thus, the portion of the impugned judgment of the Trial Court enlarging the accused Samina Bibi on probation was forthwith set aside.Samina Bibi was directed to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for eight (8) years and to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000/- as awarded by the learned Trial Court originally in respect of the appellant, Foyam Sk. for both the charges under the Indian Penal Code.The High Court also ordered that the fine imposed on the accused, if realised, would be paid to the victim.",other crimes,0
"The petitioner belonged to South 24 Parganas district in West Bengal, which has over the years became a hub from where girls are being trafficked into commercial sexual trade. The writ petitioner is a victim of Human Trafficking, who was identified, traced out and brought back from a brothel in Pune to West Bengal. As the case was lodged against the primary accused, out of which two of the accused were arrested in an alternative proceeding for which the investigation was still on going, the petitioner subsequently filed an application for victim compensation under Section 357A of the Code of Criminal Procedure r/w Section 4 of the West Bengal Victim Compensation Scheme of 2017. The application was however rejected by the Learned Secretary, D.L.S.A and the appeal before the Member Secretary, State Legal Services Authority was also rejected on the ground that the two conditions required to be satisfied to claim for the compensation, i.e the accused not being traced or identified and trial not having commenced were not fulfilled in the case of the petitioner. Therefore, the victim compensation was not granted. As a result of which the petition was brought into the notice of the High Court of Calcutta. The case is extremely important because the High Court, focused on the aspect that victims of serious crime especially when such victim is a woman, need urgent and immediate attention towards both physical and mental rehabilitation. Therefore, in such cases any denial of compensation, not only leads to violation of rights granted to victims under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution i.e right to life with dignity but it also perpetrates gross inhumanity towards them.",trafficking in persons,1

The court passed an interim direction that when any case regarding missing children is being reported in police station, the same should be reduced into a First Information Report and appropriate steps should be taken to ensure that follow up investigations takes place immediately. However, there was an element of doubt raised by the State of Madhya Pradesh regarding the recording of the First Information Report relating to missing child, having regard to the provisions of Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which relates to information in cognizable cases.

"This case involved the rape and ""sextortion"" of a 17-year-old victim. When the victim was walking towards her home from school, the defendants asked her to board the jeep they were driving. Upon her refusal they forcibly kidnapped the victim and covered the rear wind shield of the jeep by a curtain. The defendants stuffed her mouth and she was forcibly alighted from the jeep and dragged into a jungle where she was stripped and raped by the defendants. She was subsequently driven back to her village. The defendants recorded videos of the rape on a mobile phone and threatened to circulate the video and share it with her in-laws if she disclosed the rape incident to anyone. The victim did not talk about the incident out of fear that this would damage her reputation and that it may lead to her engagement being broken off. She felt so harassed by the threats of the defendants that she stopped going to school and was under immense mental stress. Subsequently, the defendants also attempted to blackmail her into performing further sexual acts with the threat of uploading the video online if she did not agree to their demands. This sextortion continued for more than one year after the rape occurred. When the victim refused to agree to her physical exploitation, the defendants uploaded the video on the Internet. The video was seen by one of the victim’s relatives who brought it to the attention of her father. Thereafter, the victim lodged a written complaint in the Court of Civil Judge (JD) and Judicial Magistrate, Sikrai.The trial court convicted the assailants and sentenced them to life imprisonment.

"Umutoni Annet (“the defendant) was charged with two counts of aggravated child trafficking and human trafficking. The defendant deceived the two victims into traveling to Uganda to work in a supermarket, promising them UGX. 100,000 to begin with and more money later. Instead the victims were forced to work as domestic workers; cleaning, cooking, and taking care of the defendant’s baby, and not paid for their work.Victim 1, (16 years old) was examined by the prosecution’s witness, (PW.1), on 22/12/2011. V1 was documented to have a tear on her posterior aspect of the hymen more than 5 days old. PW.1 documented that V1 appeared to be depressed and had been sexually assaulted.

V2 was documented to have a tear on her left posterior aspect of the hymen, and was concluded to have been penetrated by a blunt object and had a sexually transmitted disease. The doctor prescribed antibiotics, pessaries, and pain killers to treat the infection. All of which V2 received, except the pessarries.PW.1 documented that V1 looked depressed, or not happy and not comfortable. PW.1 also noted that he needed to use an interpreter when talking to V1, since there was a language barrier. During the examination, V1 told PW.1 she had been forcefully having sexual intercourse for a week with Job, one of the residents at a house where the defendant took the two victims to work.V2 had met the defendant before, when the defendant was visiting PW.3 at Gahanga in 2011, because PW.2 and V2 live next to each other.V2 (also PW.5) stated that she left home on 04/11/2014 to go to Uganda with the defendant, because she was promised a job from the defendant. V2 stated the defendant gave her money to take a taxi from her home in Garanga to Inyanza, they then travelled by car to Remera, by bus to Nyagatare, where they used motorcycles to cross through the jungles up to a swamp where they left the motorcycles and crossed the swampy river on foot up to Uganda.

"In December 2013, Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in cooperation with private sector entities, including the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit and A10 Networks Inc. disrupted the ZeroAccess botnet. The ZeroAccess botnet is a computer malware responsible for infecting more than 2 million computers using Microsoft Windows worldwide.The ZeroAccess botnet is one of the most resilient and durable botnets and was projected to be resistant to disruption attempts. Computers infected with the ZeroAccess botnet performed either Bitcoin mining or click fraud. Bitcoin mining involves the process of generating Bitcoins by using computer power. Click fraud is a computer hijacking technique redirecting infected computers to websites containing advertisements generating revenues on a pay per click basis. The revenues generated by Bitcoin mining and click fraud are sent to the cybercriminals controlling the botnet. According to Europol, the activities generated by the ZeroAccess botnet are estimated to cost advertisers USD 2.7 million per month.Microsoft filed a civil suit against the operators of the ZeroAccess botnet and was authorized by the US District Court for the Western District of Texas to simultaneously block incoming and outgoing communications between computers located in the U.S. and the 18 IP addresses used by the botnet.  Europol’s EC3 coordinated a transnational operation targeting the 18 IP addresses that lead to the execution of searches and seizures on servers associated to such IP addresses in Latvia, Luxembourg, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany.This action did not fully eliminate the ZeroAccess botnet due to its complex and resilient nature. However, it significantly affected the botnet’s operation.

The operation culminated in the arrest of 17 individuals and the seizure of Bitcoins amounting to USD 1 million, drugs, gold and silver.Among the marketplaces brought down were Silk Road 2.0, an online black market and used to sell drugs and other illegal items. In 2013, the FBI shut down its predecessor, Silk Road 1.0 and arrested its founder Ross Ulbricht, who was convicted in February 2015 in the US. Silk Road 2.0 was launched in November 2013 after the shutdown of its previous version.

"Facts: Mr. IB misappropriated funds coming from the company Park Hotel in the Country R. He transferred these illicit assets to bank accounts in Country R and finally to bank accounts under his own name in Country B. The company Park Hotel, that join a civil action to the criminal proceeding, gave illegally obtained records of the accounts of Mr. IB to show the correlation between the missing funds and the transfers realized by Mr. IB.                                                                                                  The main issue: Two major issues can be distinguished in the present case.The first one concerns the use by the civil party of an illegally obtained evidence. The judges of the Cour de cassation answered on this point by reminding that an evidence will be excluded only if the form irregularity lead to its nullity. This is the case only when the irregularity endangers the reliability of the evidence or the right to a fair trial. The judges of the Court of Appeal were therefore not obliged to exclude the evidence in this situation.The second issue regards the competency of the Country B judicial authorities to prosecute the appellant. Mr. IB raised that Country B was not competent since the predicate offence was committed in Country R and he had not been convicted for this offence there. The judges of the Cour de Cassation considered that as soon as the fact constitutive of the offence of money-laundering have been committed in the Belgium national territory of Country B, the judicial authorities were competent. Conviction for money-laundering does not require a Public action to be exercised for the predicate offence in the other State and does not even require this offence to be identified by the  judges of Country B.",money laundry,0

They laundered these illicit incomes thanks to regular loans and numerous wire transfers to bank accounts opened under their names or names of third parties.                                                                                                 The main issue: Two main legal issues are raised in this case. The first one concerns the application to the contradictory principle and the right to a fair trial to the different steps of a financial investigation. Indeed the appellants argued that they were not offered the possibility to contest the information released by the FIU to the Public Ministry. Judges of the “Cour de Cassation” rejected this argument saying that the right to a fair trial has to be appreciated globally, looking at the entire judicial proceeding, and that the information given by the FIU did not have the value of evidence before the criminal investigation started.The second central legal issue in this case was on the interpretation of confiscation. To answer the arguments of the appellants on the extent of confiscation ordered by the Appeal judges, the “Cour de Cassation”  reminded that judges of lower courts had a sovereign power of interpretation. Nevertheless, they raised ex officio the ground of the violation of provisions of the Penal Code which state that the only properties that can be confiscated are the properties materially created by the offence. They considered that saying that the assets were found at the domicile of the appellants was not sufficient to prove they were materially created by the offence. The judgement of the Court of Appeal concerning these particular assets was therefore lacking of legal basis.",money laundry,0
"Facts:During more than ten years, the electrician of the Cathedral of S, regularly stole money from the strongbox of the Cathedral. Money from various activities such as visits to museums, renting of property or donations were provisionally kept in the strongbox of the Cathedral. The electrician regularly took small sums, that at the end amounted to more than 2.5 million euros. The accused also stole a priceless manuscript, the “Codex Calixtinus”, and various items from the Cathedral.With the objective of disguise the real origin of the money, the electrician and his wife used the stolen money for the purchase of real estate.The main issue:It was discussed before the Court whether the ultimate aim of the electrician and his wife, when purchasing real estate, was to hide the real origin of the money. The wife also argued that she was unaware of the illegal origin of the money, and therefore she could not be found liable of a money laundering offence.",money laundry,0
"The Federation of Law Societies of the country C (FLSC) considers that the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing legislation (Proceeds of Crime, Money-Laundering and Terrorism Financing Act - PCMLTFA) infringes upon the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. They also argue the provisions of the aforementioned legislation breach the lawyers' duty of commitment to their clients as well as the solicitor-client privilege. The Federation launched constitutional challenges to the Act as a result.The Federation argues they already have internal policies prohibiting lawyers from conducting large cash transactions and requiring client identification, verification, and record keeping measures when lawyers effect certain financial transactions on behalf of clients. They developed a 'No Cash' policy that prevents lawyers from accepting cash exceeding $7,500 for financial transactions.",money laundry,1
"Facts:Marcial Dorado is a famous drug trafficker of Country S sentenced by a Court in 2009 to 10 years of imprisonment. Since the late eighties to early nineties, he established numerous companies in tax havens, and opened many accounts in Country SW to conceal the assets acquired through cigarette smuggling, trafficking drugs and other illicit business. Since the late nineties Dorado created a network of companies and enterprises lending money among themselves to be reinvested afterwards in the purchase of real estate or in opening legitimate businesses. The objective of these operation was to disguise the real origin of the money.Dorado had almost 20 bank account in Country S, Country P, Country SW and in Country B, and more than 17 million Swiss francs were transferred from Country SW to Country S justified as loan agreements.The main issue:The legal or illegal origin of Dorado’s fortune was discussed before the National High Court, but the 2009 Judgement condemning Dorado for drug trafficking helped to determine the illegal origin of his money and property. It was also discussed whether the network of companies Dorado built, had any utility by itself or were set up just to launder the benefits of drug trafficking.",money laundry,0

Afterwards, defendant B received from defendant A funds in the amount 8,000 roubles knowing that  they have been acquired by criminal means i.e from committing illicit trafficking of potent substances.(a violation of article 174.1 of Penal Code of Country C,” laundering of money or other property acquired by criminal means by other persons”).The main issue: The District Court was presented with the following: whether the defendants have a right, with the consent of the public prosecutor, to file a petition for a judgement without a criminal trial involving offenses for which the punishment was prescribed by the Penal Code of the Country C.",money laundry,0
"Facts:Herriko Tabernas (“Herriko taverns”) were the meeting places for members and supporters of the Basque independence movement, some of which supported the terrorist organization ETA. Many Herriko Tabernas were owned by Batasuna, a political party illegalized due its connexions with ETA. The benefits obtained from these taverns were used to finance the terrorism organization. The Herriko Tabernas were also the main logistic infrastructure for the activities carried out by many organizations connected with the separatist movement.The main issue:Two issues were discussed before the National High Court. First, whether the political party Batasuna was part of the terrorist organization ETA, or was an independent and autonomous organism. Second if the benefits from the Herriko Tabernas was employed for the personal use of Batasuna leaders, was used for the financing of the activities of the political party itself, or was effectively used for the financing of ETA.",money laundry,0

"Dominique X was charged by an examining magistrate in city C of country F, with a number of offences such as aggravated money laundering, misappropriation, concealment of assets in bankruptcy in connection to a principal offence which was the concealment of assets belonging to a Limited Liability Company Y by a different offender.Outcome: The Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation had confirmed the legality of the decision of the Investigating Chamber of the Court of Appeal. Therefore, money laundering must be analyzed as an autonomous offence when identified in connection with other offences, and notably in relationship to aggravated money laundering resulting from bankruptcy through concealment of assets which was the main offence in this case. Consequently, criminal proceedings of a money laundering offence are not precluded if the main offence has not been or will not be prosecuted.",money laundry,0
"J. Bank Ltd (hereinafter: J. Bank), a credit institution operating as a branch of the NS J. Bank was situated in Gibraltar. It operated in country S. under the rules on the freedom to provide services, that is to say without being established there, and under the supervision of the Financial Services Commission (Gibraltar supervisory authority). The FIU of country S. (Servicio Ejecutivo) suspected that J. Bank was being used for money laundering operations in the context of its activities, mainly the granting of mortgages for the purchase of property in this country, while being supported by the branch in country S. of the parent company and by two local law firms. Consequently, the FIU of country S. asked J. Bank to provide data on the identity of its clients. The latter refused, referring to the baning secrecy rules applicable in Gibraltar. The Consejo de Ministros then decided that J. Bank had failed to fulfil its disclosure obligations under the law of country S. and ordered for reprimands and financial penalties of a total amount of  EUR 1, 700 000.The main issue: The Court of Justice of the European Union was presented with the following question: whether credit institutions operating but not established in a host Member State, were required to send information necessary for combatting money laundering and the financing of terrorism directly to the FIU of the host Member State or forward the information to their own authorities responsible for the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.Outcome:  The Court welcomed the question because it concerned the interpretation of EU law, despite the country S’s argument that it was purely hypothetical. Also, the Court chose to refer to other provisions of EU law besides article 22 (2) of Directive 2005/60, namely provisions of Decision 2000/642 and article 56 TFEU, to which the national court had not referred in its question, in order to bring a satisfactory answer. As to article 22(2) of Directive 2005/60/EC, the CJEU made a literal analysis of the wording of its provisions and it considered that the legislation of country S. pursued a similar goal to that of this Directive, i.e. the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing. In so far as the legislation of country S. sought to strengthen, in compliance with European Union law, the effectiveness of the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, it was not precluded by article 22(2) of Directive 2005/60/EC. The Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) examined whether such legislation was precluded by article 22(2) of Directive 2005/60/EC or by the prohibition to restrict the freedom to provide services, as provided for by article 56 TFEU. As to article 56 TFEU, the CJEU considered that legislation requiring credit institutions operating in a host Member State to provide information directly to the FIU of that host Member State as well, constituted, in principle, a restriction on the freedom to provide services, in so far as it gives rise to difficulties and additional costs for activities carried out in the host Member State. Nevertheless, the restrictive effect is justified because it meets an overriding requirement relating to the public interest, which public interest is not already safeguarded by the rules of the Member State in which the credit institution is established.",money laundry,0
"Facts: The French Tamil Coordination Committee was an association used as a legal counterpart of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE), classified as a terrorist organization in all countries of the European Union. It rose funds for the LTTE by using threats and violence against the Tamil community members in France. This association has no legal directors but two de facto leaders, Mrs. X and Mr. Z. The main issue: In this case, the main issue discussed concerns the possibility for a legal entity to be held responsible for acts committed by its de facto directors. Therefore, the Cour de Cassation has to give an interpretation of the article 121-2 of the Penal Code , which states that legal entities are criminally responsible only for acts committed by their agents and organs, in the name of the legal entity. A dissolution of the legal entity can only be handed down under these conditions.  The Court opted for a in concreto assessment of the facts and considered that the real objective the association was created for is the funding and financing of a terrorist group. Therefore the statutory objectives and the legal situation of Mrs.X and Mr.Z were not preventing the application of article 121-2 of the Penal Code.",money laundry,0
"Facts:Between 2005 and 2008, a criminal organisation dedicated to drug trafficking, laundered the revenues of its crimes through an exchange house. Different members of the organizationregularly brought large amounts of money to the exchange house. The head of the business, Tarek Chartouni, and the manager, Francisco Gutierrez, laundered that money buying foreign currency without recording the operations, and without informing the Financial Intelligence Unit.The defendants also laundered the money through ""hawala"", an informal funds transfer system, handling money in one city and delivering an equivalent amount in foreign currency in another city, without physical transfer of funds.Tarek and Francisco received a percentage of each operation, and the Court found that they laundered a total amount of approximately 500 million Chilean pesos.The main issue:The Court considered whether the accused knew the illicit origin of the money. Since belonging to an organized criminal group is an aggravating circumstance under national law, the defendants tried to prove the absence of relation with the criminal organization.Another relevant issue discussed before the court was the appreciation of the evidence. All the accused argued that there was not enough proof of their implication in the crimes, and that any conviction would violate their presumption of innocence. The court accepted this argument for three of the defendants.",money laundry,0
"Facts: From 1995 to 1999 Mr. X was trading arms  in France on the behalf of Angola and Cameroon, to ensure their supply. This trade was undeclared and Mr. X realized several operations of conversions or transfers of funds derived from this illicit activity. He was acting via shell companies to acquire real-estate in Paris and Antibes whereas his tax residence was established in the United-Kingdom or later Russia. The investigation showed that he was the ultimate purchaser in all transactions operated by these shell companies. Mr.Z , his tax lawyer, helped him in some of these acquisitions, which represented several millions of francs in total.           The main issue: The main issue discussed by the Court concerned the scope of the immunity from jurisdiction on  sovereign acts of a foreign state and its extension to the use of the assets derived from the acts covered by the immunity. The appellants argued that French tribunals cannot convict under the offence of money laundering whereas the predicate offence ( here the trade of arms) was covered by immunity from jurisdiction.  The judges of the Cour de Cassation considered that acts relative to the use of assets derived from the predicate offence were not protected by sovereign immunity of States. The offence of money laundering is independent and the immunity of jurisdiction is without any effect on the legality of acts to which it is applicable.",money laundry,0
"Facts:Del Valle was the owner of a law firm devoted to provide advice to foreign investors in the national real estate business, creating a system that allowed such investor to launder money. Such a concealment system could be used to hide unreported earnings and proceeds of crime.The system used to facilitate such investments was the creation of holding companies in the country, which were facilitated by companies established in the US State of Delaware, whose legislation permit the concealment of the ultimate beneficiaries and owners in the deed and foundational titles. The clients investing in Spain through a Delaware company could ensure their anonymity since the inversion effectively carried out in Spain formally came from an American company, founding partner of the Spanish society.Besides helping many clients to use this system to launder money, Del Valle also used the system for his own interest. He had shares in 194 foreign companies, being 143 from Delaware and 39 from different territories classified as tax heavens.The main issue:Since the procedure included 19 people, the argument raised were very diverse, but before the Provincial Court, as well as before the Supreme Court the argument raised were mainly about the evaluation of the evidence. Ultimately it was considered that the evidence collected in the investigation was not enough to condemn 14 of the accused.Before the Supreme Court, Del Valle claimed that during the investigation his fundamental rights were violated, especially during telephone interceptions. The Court partially accepted it and declared null and void the evidence taken from the telephone interceptions.",money laundry,0

It turned out that the seller’s online shop was a scam and the defendant’s account was used for the fraud. The defendant –unaware of the illicit activities – had provided his access information and allowed for an unknown person (the seller) to use his account for a monthly fee of  € 400.Main issue:The defendant had already been found guilty of money laundering under the Criminal Code by the Criminal Courts.

"Facts: Mr. X is not the author of the bankruptcy offence but he concealed assets derived from the bankruptcy of the SARL Y. and conducted several operations of conversions and transfers with these funds. Though the predicate offence of bankruptcy and some of the acts constitutive of the offence of money laundering with aggravating circumstances took place more than three years before the initial request of the Strasbourg prosecutor in 2006, Mr. X conducted some of these operations after this date.           The main issue: The central issue in this case is the question of the impact of the prescription period of the predicate offence on the possibility for judicial authorities to prosecute under the offence of money laundering. Is the prescription period of the money laundering offence dependant of the prescription period of the predicate offence (here the bankruptcy)? The Criminal Chamber of the Cour de Cassation ruled that since the money laundering offence was an autonomous offence, its prescription period had to be independent from the one of the predicate offence.",money laundry,0
"FACTS :On 6 June 2003, A opened a bank account in the name of F. F, the 12 years old son of C and D a federal judge, was falsely designated by A as the beneficial owner of the funds deposited in that account when A knew or ought to have assumed that the real owner was C or D.  A credited the account with holdings of securities valued at approximately USD 3.6 million from another account whose holder and beneficial owner was C and whose proxy was D, knowing or at least suspecting that the origin of these assets could be criminal. Indeed, A with his skills, his long experience and knowledge about Latin America and the latent corruption that prevails, should have known that the licit income and the wealth of C and D did not allow to justify the origin of this assets. Furthermore, the account opening documents provided no plausible information about the origin of the funds. A also hid the fact that D was a federal judge in order to avoid labelling the banking relationship as Politically Exposed Person (PEP) and thus escape the necessary clarifications. Even after having learned, during a trip to Brazil between 27 October 2003 and 10 November 2003, that D, charged with criminal association, sales of Court decisions and corruption, and C, accused of being his  “Straw man”  and the book-keeper of the criminal organisation, were arrested, A made no clarifications on the origin of the assets. From 30 October 2003, date of the arrest, to 26 May 2004, A authorized several financial transactions in USD, EUR and CHF on the account.THE MAIN ISSUES :Concerning the accusation of document’s forgery, the Court was looking if F was the actual beneficial owner of the funds deposited on the account or if this name was purposely used to dupe. Relating to the lack of due diligence in financial operations and the money laundering allegation, four points were discussed. First, if a crime had been committed beforehand. If that was the case, if the money deposited on the account came from that origin. Deriving from that fact, if A knew or should assume the criminal origin of the assets. The last question raised was about the non-qualification of the banking relationship as a PEP in regard to the function, federal judge, of the father of F, the beneficial owner.",money laundry,0

"Facts: On the 12th November 1999, the BPLL opened an account for the Sheen SARL company. The articles of association of this company stated that it aimed to provide financial services ( as credits and investments services) and its two principal directors had their tax domicile in the Channel Islands, the account being opened by an Italian mandatory. Despite this risky situation the bank did not check the reality of the incorporation of the Sheen company, of its accreditation and its activities. By using another company, the IPFE, to ensure the promotion of its services, the Sheen company made French people invest in several false products and defraud important amounts of money. It created confusion by making these people emit the bank cheque at the name of the BPLL, so they believe the Sheen company was a branch of this bank. Although consequent transfers were realized by the Sheen company and numerous bank cheque were emitted to its benefice, the bank did not conduct further researches.    The main issue:Two main issues were discussed in this case. The first one concerned the obligation of due diligence of financial institutions at the opening of the bank account and especially to check the accreditation of any company providing financial services. Is this obligation, targeting in particular foreigner companies, a restriction of the freedom to provide services in the  European Union? The second issue consists in the determination of the legal consequences of the absence of enhanced due diligence by the bank in a particularly risky situation. Is this lack to subscribe to its obligations constitutive of a fault, implying a civil liability towards the victims of the fraud operated by the Sheen company? As far as the first issue is concerned, the Commercial chamber of the Cour de Cassation considered that there was no restriction of the freedom to provide services.  On the second one, the judges confirmed the Court of Appeal reasoning and ruled that the lack of enhanced due diligence measures in a situation presenting so many risks and abnormalities can be constitutive of a fault and result in the compensation of the victims of the fraud.NB: The compatibility of these due diligence obligations with European primary law was confirmed by the ECJ in case C-212/11.",money laundry,0
"Facts:In October 2005, the suspicious characteristics of the luggage of two passengers, Luz Acosta and Javier Guzman, made customs officials at the international airport Ministro Pistarini, stop and inspect them. They found a large amount of undeclared money carefully hidden in the luggage of the passengers; $348,000 in the baggage of Luz, and $270.000 in the baggage of Javier.Luz and Javier were part of a scheme to launder money gained from illicit activities carried out in a foreign country, in which none of them had participated. Their mission was to bring the money into the country and use it to invest in property.The main issue:The Court had to rule whether the money found in the luggage of Luz and Javier had an illicit origin. The accused claimed that the money was obtained by lawful means, however the Court found that the defendants did not have any source of income that could justify such an amount of money. Therefore, it was inferred that the money was proceeds of crime, and under national law such assumption is enough to prove that money laundering had occurred. Ultimately the accused admitted the illicit origin of the money.The case also raised the issue of the commission of the predicated offence in a foreign country, but the Court found that the place where the predicate offence is committed is irrelevant, and that what matters is the place where the proceeds of the crime are laundered.",money laundry,0
"Facts:The Aguilas Negras, or Black Eagles, are a non-cohesive group of former paramilitary men dedicated to the extortion of Mayors, traders and transporters, and also involved in drug trafficking, targeted killing of people and threats. Raul Prada was involved in the activities of the terrorist group, and when the judicial investigation started he held the position of commander of the “Bloque sur de Bolívar”, one of the fractions of the group. Luis Herrera was also a relevant member of the group, having the responsibility of monitoring the due payment of the shares by the extorted persons, as well as providing the organization with food and other supplies.The main issue:Since the judgment of the Criminal Court of First Instance was based on the declarations of two witnesses that later retracted their statements, the main issue discussed before the Regional Superior Court, was whether the Court should consider such statements as valid evidence. The defendants argued that the declaration made by the witnesses incriminating them in the illegal activities, were made under threat or under a promise of rewards.The defendants argued that since the witnesses statement could not be considered a valid proof, there was not enough evidence to prove that they were part of the terrorist group and that they were involved in its financing.",money laundry,0
"Facts: The appellant A owned a mortgage business called the Mortgage Shop in County S. He introduced clients to mortgage brokers, who paid a fee for the introduction. He was prosecuted for knowingly submitting false mortgage applications on behalf of third parties as co-defendants. They were charged under the law of Country B.The main issue: The issue was whether property became “criminal property” for the purposes of Proceeds of Crime Act of Country B only after some other offence had been committed or whether it was to be characterised as criminal property because of the criminal objective which the arrangements were designed to achieve. The defendant argued that when he entered into the arrangements with the mortgage brokers, and even when they were carried into effect, he was not thereby facilitating the acquisition of criminal property, because at that time the property was not criminal in the hands of the mortgage company; it only became criminal property when it came into his hands or the hands of those for whom he was securing the mortgage.

"Facts:The appellant was arrested and charged with a number of drug-related offences (trafficking and money laundering). . For that relating to ''money laundering'', the appellant was sentenced to seven and a half years' imprisonment. On the charge of trafficking in a marketable quantity of heroin, he was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. Finally, on that of trafficking in a commercial quantity of dimethylamphetamine, he was sentenced to six years imprisonment. The sentencing judge determined that the sentence on the count of trafficking in a marketable quantity of heroin was to be the base sentence.  This resulted in a total effective sentence of ten years imprisonment. A period of seven years was required to be served before the appellant became eligible for parole.Main issue:The sentences on all counts were claimed to be manifestly excessive, resulting in a total effective sentence that was also manifestly excessive. The sentences imposed on the appellant on, respectively, the counts of money laundering and trafficking in a commercial quantity of dimethylamphetamine apparently offended the principle of parity with due regard to the sentences imposed on the co-offenders T, N and S.",money laundry,0
"Facts: Application by the prosecution to strike out the accused's appeal. The accused reasoned that the dismissal of his request for the release of funds seized during the execution of a search warrant violated his rights.The police had seized the sum of US$56,000 from the accused's vehicle. The search was part of an investigation which led to the accused being charged with two offences violating the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The accused sought the release of all or part of the seized funds to cover his reasonable legal expenses given that he had been rejected for legal aid and his legal counsel was representing him on a pro bono basis. The applications judge dismissed the accused's application for the release of the funds as he was not prepared to draw an inference that the accused had established a legitimate possession of the funds so as to reduce the concern that the funds were the proceeds of crime. The accused sought to appeal the decision on the basis that the applications judge erred in considering the legitimacy of his possession of the funds given that it was not contested by the prosecution and that the only issue for consideration was the state of his financial affairs as it affected his need to pay counsel fees from the seized funds.Main Issue:Possibility to appeal against a decision by the application judge, seeking to release of all or part of the seized funds to cover the accused's reasonable legal expenses.",money laundry,0
"Facts:Appeal by the accused from conviction for offences related to a conspiracy to import and traffic in heroin. The prosecution obtained a wiretap authorization to intercept private communications of the accused and others for the investigation of firearm and drug offences. The accused and others were allegedly involved in arms dealing and the ongoing importation and distribution of wholesale quantities of heroin from country P. Police seized five kilograms of heroin from a courier boarding a bus in city T bound for city V. The accused challenged the validity of the wiretap authorization at trial on the basis that the supporting affidavit did not meet the investigative necessity requirement and did not meet the reasonable grounds requirement for the alleged firearm offences. The affidavit disclosed that a  police informer was approached by a group including the accused about acquiring a large number of automatic weapons in exchange for heroin. The informer met with the group and reported the discussions, some of which were observed by police. The transaction did not proceed. Police had information from another person, a long-time drug user and street trafficker, concerning the group's involvement in importing and trafficking in drugs and distributing firearms. Police also intercepted one kilogram of heroin sent from country A to a residence containing correspondence mentioning the accused by name. In addition, the Drug Enforcement Administration of country A had sought RCMP assistance in investigating the accused for drug and money laundering offences and provided a recorded conversation in which the accused discussed receipt and sale of a shipment of heroin.

"Facts:The plaintiff was the chairman and executive director of a listed company. It was the plaintiff's case that the 1st defendant told him that he had incurred substantial losses trading in the shares of the plaintiff's company. The 1st defendant demanded from the plaintiff 100 million shares of the plaintiff's company, which the plaintiff rejected. The 1st and 2nd defendant attended the plaintiff's office and made threats that if the 100 million shares were not handed over, the 4th defendant, a person who identified himself as a member of a criminal organisation, would do something harmful to the plaintiff. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff purchased 100 million shares from the third party Z. Z executed a share purchase agreement for the shares with the 3rd defendant as transferee and the 2nd defendant as guarantor. Z was further threatened by the 2nd defendant to sign a receipt acknowledging the payment for the shares.The plaintiff applied to join the 5th and 6th defendants in the action. The plaintiff alleged that the 5th defendant, the wife of the 1st defendant, was involved in the setting up of a sham trust and received, handled and laundered the 100 million shares via the sham trust and other companies of the 1st defendant. As against the 6th defendant, the plaintiff alleged that he was the nominee, agent or trustee of the 1st defendant and under his control to receive, keep, handle and launder the 100 million shares through companies that he controlled. The plaintiff also relied on the fact that the 6th defendant was arrested by the police in relation to the offence of money laundering in connection with the sale of the 100 million shares.Main issue:In the hearing before the judge, 5th and 6th defendants were represented by counsel. It was argued that the 5th and 6th defendants should be allowed to file affidavit evidence in opposition and substantive argument adjourned for full argument. The 5th and 6th defendants did not disclose their grounds of objection to joinder. After hearing submissions from both parties, the judge acceded to the plaintiff's application and joined the 5th and 6th defendants as defendants. The 5th and 6th defendants appealed. During the appeal hearing, the court was informed that the 5th and 6th defendants' grounds of opposition were that the application for joinder was based on the allegation of the plaintiff that the 5th and 6th defendants were in control of the sham trust which substantively conflicted with a decision given in this matter and therefore issue estoppel arose; and that the police had indicated that there was no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the 6th defendant in relation to the laundering of the 100 million shares and no prosecution would be brought against the 6th defendant.",money laundry,0
"In November 2014, law enforcement and prosecutors in Europe and the US launched Operation Onymous, an international operation aimed at taking down online illegal markets and arresting vendors and administrators of such markets. The operation was coordinated by Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), Eurojust, the FBI, and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). The operation culminated in the arrest of 17 individuals and the seizure of Bitcoins amounting to USD 1 million, drugs, gold and silver.Among the marketplaces brought down were Silk Road 2.0, an online black market and used to sell drugs and other illegal items. In 2013, the FBI shut down its predecessor, Silk Road 1.0 and arrested its founder Ross Ulbricht, who was convicted in February 2015 in the US. Silk Road 2.0 was launched in November 2013 after the shutdown of its previous version. On 5 November 2015, the alleged administrator of Silk Road 2.0, Blake Benthall, was arrested by the FBI in San Francisco.

"Operation “Exposure” was an international cybercrime investigation carried out in Europe and South America. In February 2012, law enforcement from various countries arrested 25 alleged members of the international hacking network Anonymous. Ten arrests were made in Argentina, six in Chile, five in Colombia and four in Spain.The Anonymous network is widely known for its cyber attacks on public and private institutions' websites. Anonymous has an extremely loose structure and operates internationally. Among its victims are governmental agencies of the US, Israel, Tunisia and Uganda; child pornography websites; copyright protection institutions; religious entities; and private corporations, including Paypal, MasterCard, Visa and Sony.Anonymous’ most common forms of attack are distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, web defacements and information disclosure. A DDoS attack is a service interruption making a website unavailable to its users. In order to disrupt a website, the attackers overload the website’s server with simultaneous communications requests. Such requests either slow down the website or make it unavailable.The suspects were charged with illegal interference, breach of privacy and disclosure of confidential information. One of the suspects - known as “Thunder” or “Pacotron” - was allegedly responsible for managing Anonymous’ communication channels in Spain and South America. He was arrested by Spanish authorities in Malaga, Spain. The arrests in Spain include a 16-year old, who allegedly took part in the cyber attacks.Law enforcement agencies of the involved countries carried out the investigation. INTERPOL and EUROPOL facilitated information sharing and provided support. In particular, the EUROPOL Cyber Crime Centre allowed the preservation of data contained in servers located in Bulgaria and Czech Republic. EUROPOL agents supported law enforcement in Spain and Bulgaria in arrests, searches and server disruptions.",cybercrime,0
"In 2000, the defendant resided in Madrid (Spain). He used to receive in his residence women in provenance from Moldova that irregularly entered the country with fraudulent passports procured by third parties. The women had gone to Spain under promises of work as dancers, under appealing labour conditions and remuneration. However, once in Spain, they were informed to have contracted a debt in the amount of 20 000 Euro.Upon arrival, the defendant seized the women’s passport and accompanied them to the envisaged place of work: sex establishments. The women were paid daily on the basis of the consumption of clients. They also received a weekly salary. The entirety of their income was to be handed to the defendant who then delivered it to a third person.Several women were heard by authorities. They confirmed the facts above described and further stated to have engaged in sexual relations with the defendant. Some stated to have been forced to do so, others declared they had to engage in such practices in order to receive gifts or privileged treatment.On 12 December 2000, authorities carried out a search operation to the residence of the defendant. They seized seven authentic Polish passports, and one authentic Polish ID card, all belonging to women. The original pictures had been replaced by those of the smuggled migrants/victims in the instant case. Authorities further found evidence of wire transfers made by the defendant in favour of an individual in Moldova in the amounts of 481 800, 209 215, 207 965, 498 997, 39 798, and 452 018 Pesetas.

His arrest took place on 20 July 2016.The defendant denied the accusations. Rather, it maintained to have merely assisted fellow nationals, who had gone to Spain and found themselves in precarious situation. He declared never to have threatened or paid the victims to have intercourse with him. Fearful for their safety, he would have accompanied the women to and from their place of work and – in an act of friendship – go shopping for them. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence and the outcome of search and seizure operations. Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor accused the defendant of migrant smuggling, unlawful detention, sexual aggression (continuous offence), and crimes against the rights of workers. As far as migrant smuggling is concerned, the Public Prosecution requested the defendant to be sentenced to five years imprisonment and fine of 24 months at the daily rate of 7 Euro.The Provincial Court of Madrid acquitted the defendant. For further details see “Commentary",other crimes,1
"Date(s) of offending: on/from 2003 to 23 January 2004In the course of 2003, Defendants 1 and 2 initiated recruiting Romanian young women, in Romania, with the purpose of procuring their illegal entry and stay in Spain.

"Date(s) of offending: on/from 2009 to TBC - at least, 2011Defendant 1, originally from Nigeria, addressed in that country a woman (D.) of humble origins, promising work and a better life in Spain for a fee of 30 000 Euro. With that purpose, D. left to Morocco, where she remained nearly three years waiting for Defendant 1 to bring her to Spain. Finally, in 2009, Defendant 1 facilitated the illegal entry of D. and her five year old child, by sea, in Algeciras (Spain) for the price of 18 000 Euro. D. then travelled to Madrid (Spain) by bus, where she was received by Defendant 1. They immediately travelled by plane to Gran Canaria (Spain). D. used the passport of another person, which was given to her by Defendant 1.D. lodged in the residence of Defendant 1, together with the latter’s husband (Defendant 2) and another woman.D. was immediately forced to work as a prostitute by Defendants 1 and 2 as well as Defendant 3 (brother of Defendant 1) so as to pay the costs of the travel to Spain, allegedly in the amount of 18 000 Euro. Furthermore, D. should pay the costs of living, notably (i) 125 Euro for water and electricity, (ii) 50 Euro for food, (iii) 200 Euro rent. In addition, she was to pay 300 Euro to Defendant 3 for taking care of her child while she was working as a prostitute. Both D. and her son were physically abused as a means of forcing D. into prostitution. Likewise, she was threatened with harm on her and her relatives, notably though voodoo rituals. In this manner, the Defendants managed that D. always delivered the total amount of her gains at the end of the day. Defendant 2 was in charge of taking note of the payments done. Victim N. became acquainted with Defendant 1 in Morocco. The latter promised the former work in a supermarket in Spain. In exchange for a money fee, Defendant 1 organised the illegal entry of N. in Spain, by sea. She arrived in Granada (Spain) in 2011, together with her son. She met an intermediary of Defendant 1 in Madrid, who delivered her false documentation so she could be able to board a plane to Gran Canaria on 2 April 2011. N. was then received by Defendant 1 and taken to the latter’s residence. She was forced into prostitution by all Defendants with the alleged purpose of paying the costs of the travel (in the reported amount of 30 000 Euro). N. was threatened with serious harm to her, her child, and close relatives, though she was never actually physically abused.Every night, D. and N. left the residence of Defendants 1 and 2 towards a designated area where they worked as prostitutes from 00.00 to 06.00. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied on testimonial evidence and electronic surveillance (telephone bugging).

"Date(s) of offending: on/from 2003 to 23 January 2004The civil police of Melilla (Spain) was informed by the Moroccan police that a certain vehicle (van type, identified by manufacturer, model and licence number) had been intercepted in the border crossing point of Beni-Enzar (Morocco) transporting undocumented sub-Saharan migrants. A third individual (not subject to the proceedings in casu) was driving the vehicle. The purpose had been to facilitate the illegal entry of said migrants in Spain. On the basis of such information, the Spanish police attempted to ascertain whether the vehicle had been previously used in the smuggling of migrants into Spain. Through SIAM - Sistema de Identificación Automática de Matrícula(Automated System of Identification of Licenses), it was confirmed that the vehicle had crossed the border to Spain on 15 April 2012, through the border post of Farhana (Morocco). It was further determined that on 16 April 2012, two sub-Saharan migrants (H. and R.) had been registered in CETI - Centro de Estancia Temporal de Inmigrantes (Centre of Temporary Stay for Migrants). No relationship was confirmed between such migrants and the defendants. This notwithstanding, the vehicle was registered in the name of Defendant 2 and the irregular migrants spent one night in a farm property of Defendant 1 (where the latter had his residence).  In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence. Notably, irregular migrant H. recognised the vehicle they travelled in as being the one previously identified by the Moroccan police as well as the point of entry in Spain. She further identified the place where the migrants had spent one night as being the farm property of Defendant 2. It is relevant to note that this identification process was carried out before the Guardia Civilrather than the Criminal Police, via photographs. It was submitted the defendants integrated an organised criminal group. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Málaga (Spain)acquitted the defendants of crimes against the rights of foreign citizens. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,0
"The judgment decides the appeal presented by an individual against her conviction (together with two other defendants: F. and L.) for crimes against the rights of foreign citizens (which comprises the smuggling of migrants).It was ascertained that the appellant J. - alone or together with others – directed, from Badajoz (Spain),a criminal plot aimed at procuring and or enabling illegal entry and or stay into Spain, upon payment of 3000 to 4000 Euro per person. In order to facilitate the regularisation of migrants’ situation in Spain, J. procured, by herself or through Spanish collaborators, fraudulent work contracts. These contracts were then submitted to the competent governmental office, thus opening the way for migrants to obtain residence and work permits in the country. The recruitment of migrants and their initial accommodation in Spain was taken care of by J., upon corresponding payment. She also assisted migrants in administrative formalities, as the registration before the appropriate authorities (e.g. re work and residence permits). Defendants F. and L. collaborated in this criminal plan by standing as potential employers/authors of fraudulent offers of employment aimed at facilitating the acquisition of work and residence permits by irregular migrants. The findings of the court were based, inter alia, on declarations of smuggled migrants, and the accused. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Badajoz convicted J, of aggravated crimes against the rights of foreign citizens, and F. and L. for the same crime, in its attenuated modality. The Supreme Court partially upheld the decision. For further details on the proceedings see “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"Defendants 1, 3 and 4 - regular residents in Spain - were accused of arranging, upon the payment of considerable fees, sham marriages between the female defendants and foreign nationals (mostly of Pakistani nationality) with the purpose of allowing the latter to regularly enter and or stay in Spain. Specifically, Defendant 4 would recruit clients (irregular migrants), Defendant 3 would search for women willing to engage in the planned sham marriages, while Defendant 1 would facilitate the actual entry of migrants in Spain.All female defendants indeed contracted marriages. Three of them remained married until the time of the decision herein under analysis. The fourth one was married for five years until she later divorced. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence.

"The judgment decides the appeal presented by five individuals against their conviction for crimes against the rights of foreign citizens (which comprises the smuggling of migrants).It was ascertained that in 2010-2011, appellant J. M. was the lawyer of a company named SELMA, based in Barcelona (Spain). Appellant P. was the formal administrator thereof but it was J.M. who in reality took on the administration of the company. He also provided his services to several physical persons, amongst whom the appellants V. and J. The appellants agreed to establish a purported massage business. The intent was to employ Peruvian women as prostitutes. The women would be offered fraudulent work contracts as housemaids, with the purpose of eluding emigration controls. J.M. and appellant S. often travelled to Peru, where they offered Peruvian women in a difficult situation the possibility to come to Spain without undergoing the applicable legal procedures to work as prostitutes. S. selected the women and organise visits with J.M.. In those meetings, the women were to have sexual relations with J.M. The appellants submitted to the competent governmental office, a number of fraudulent work contracts and initiated the related procedures for obtaining work and residence permits to the afore-mentioned Peruvian women. The women were then brought into Spain, thus giving effect to the plan established by the appellants. The purpose thereof was that of obtaining a financial gain. At least three work and residence permits were issued. In one documented case, a Peruvian woman travelled to Spain, with the assistance of the appellants, without the issuance of the residence and work permit.The women were collected at the airport, usually by J.M., and transported to a house of his property, where prostitution activities took place. Each woman occupied a room. In the company of J.M., all women opened a bank account to receive part of the profits deriving from the prostitution enterprise. S. worked as cleaning lady in the house and effectuated the monitoring of clients getting in and out. S. was also in charge of distributing the profit (40% for the women and 60% to J.M.). The women further paid the rent to J.M. and were responsible for costs related to the maintenance of the house. In addition, the women were to pay to J.M. the cost of their plane ticket and administrative expenses related to the issuance of work and residence permits. This amounted to app. 4000-5000 Euro.The male appellants often resorted to the sexual services of the women they had assisted to illegally enter and stay in Spain. The findings of the court were based, inter alia, on declarations of smuggled migrants, and the appellants. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Barcelonaconvicted the appellants of, inter alia, crimes against the rights of foreign citizens: (i) J.M. and S. received a penalty of six years and one month imprisonment; (ii) V.

Upon checking the document, authorities indeed realised that the picture on the document did not match that in the archives relating to the same document I.D. number and name.Following investigations, it was determined as follows:Defendant 1 pretended his daughter (named E.) had lost her residence card. He thus referred the situation to authorities and claimed a new card. To the latter, he attached the picture of the irregular migrant rather than his own daughter.Defendant 1 hence managed to obtain a legally issued – though fraudulently obtained – residence card.Defendant 1 sent the residence card to the irregular migrant E., with the purpose of facilitating her illegal entry in Spain. Irregular migrant E. was also daughter of Defendant 1.Defendant 2 (spouse of Defendant 1) also denounced to have lost her residence card, requesting the issuance of a new one. She delivered a photo that was not her own. In this manner, she obtained a second residence card with a picture of another person. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied on testimonial evidence. Documental evidence was also considered. Expert evidence played an important role. Specifically, Defendant 2 argued that the photo in the second residence card was her own; that is, it would be a picture taken several years earlier when she was undergoing many difficulties, which transpired in her looks and physique. The photo in question was analysed by experts on the matter and via a computers program that allowed the meticulous analysis of minimal traits. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain)convicted Defendant 1of migrant smuggling and falsification of documents. It convicted Defendants 2 of falsification of documents.The Supreme Court reviewed the penalty for migrant smuggling. It dismissed the appeal in the remaining. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,0
"On 1 October 2011, at approximately 23.50, police authorities in the Maritime Station of Ceuta (Spain) assessed the vehicle driven by the defendant. The defendant intended to board the ferry in direction to Algeciras (mainland Spain). Authorities realised he was transporting a female woman – later determined to be his life partner – who did not possess the necessary documents to enter Spain. The defendant had provided his partner with an authentic Moroccan passport and a Spanish residence permit belonging to another person. He submitted these documents to authorities with the purpose of deceiving them and, consequently, receiving authorisation to board the ferry with his companion. In the vehicle also travelled the newly born son of the defendant and his common law wife.  Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor had initially pursued criminal charges against the defendant’s companion for use of an authentic ID by an unauthorised person. The case against her was later dropped. The Provincial Court of Cádiz (Spain) convicted the defendant of attenuated migrant smuggling and, as necessary accomplice, use of an authentic identification document by unauthorised person. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"On 11 November 2009, the Embassy of Thailand in Spain received a phone call whereby it was alleged that six women were being held at a certain location and forced into prostitution. Two of the women had managed to escape and sought the assistance of the Embassy of Thailand. The Consul of Thailand addressed the Police in Burgos (Spain) asking for an investigation. The facts of the case are as follows. Four Thai women (A., As. C. and D.) approached a group of people in Thailand with the purpose of receiving assistance in entering Spain illegally. The said group of people procured to the women visas, plane tickets, hotel reservations, and some cash – between 100 Euro and 200 Euro – so that, in the course of border control proceedings, they could give the appearance of solvency for the period they were supposed to remain in Spain. The Thai women thus engaged in debts ranging between 15 000 Euro and 17 000 Euro for the costs of travel and documentation. They were supposed to pay for it with the proceeds of their work in Spain. Two of the women (A. and As.) had gone to Spain with the intent of working as prostitutes. The third one (C.) – while having been offered work as massagist – agreed to work in prostitution upon her arrival in Spain. Finally, the fourth woman (D.) was intended to work as a waitress. She never engaged in prostitution notably because the day after her arrival in Spain occurred the police operation that underpinned the instant case.A. arrived to the airport f Madrid-Barajas (Spain) on 17 September 2009. She was collected by Defendant 2 (life partner of one of the persons the four Thai women had approached in Thailand in order to receive assistance in entering Spain illegally) and with whom she had a child. As. Arrived at the same airport on 18 September, having been collected by Defendants 2 and 3. Defendants 2 and 3 immediately transported both women, in a van, to the Club ‘La Boheme’, approximately 234 Km away from Madrid, close to Burgos, where they settled.C. arrived to the airport of Barcelona (Spain) on 29 October 2009. She was collected by Defendant 1. The latter accompanied the irregular migrant to the bus station, bought her a ticket to Burgos. Upon arrival, C. was collected by Defendants 2 and 6.D. arrived to the airport of Madrid- Barajas on 10 November 2009. She was collected by Defendant 1. The same follow-up procedure as that adopted in respect of C. was engaged. C. and D. were also immediately accommodated in the Club ‘La Boheme’.A., As., and C. started prostituting themselves in ‘La Boheme’ the day after their arrival. The Club kept 50% of the price of beverages clients invited them to. When clients wished to engage in sexual relations, Defendant 5 charged them 5 Euro for a packet composed of one bed sheet, one towel, one condom. The bedroom and sexual services price amounted to 50 Euro. This fee was allocated to the payment of the women’s debt towards the defendants. Importantly, the women were charged 50 Euro per day for accommodation and maintenance at ‘La Boheme’.‘La Boheme’ was managed by Defendant 4. The latter was the administrator of a company dedicated to the creation and development inter alia of hotels, bars, leisure centres. He was regularly present at the ‘La Boheme’. Defendant 2 was also a cook in this establishment while Defendant 6 worked both as waiter and security thereof. Defendant 3 was an employee of ‘La Boheme’, working as driver and in the maintenance of the establishment. Defendant 5 worked as receptionist of the section of ‘La Boheme’ where the four Thai women lived and exercised prostitution. She was thus the one usually receiving payments from clients regarding services supplied by the Thai women.All defendants were fully aware the Thai women (i) had entered Spain illegally, (ii) had incurred into considerable debt as a consequence thereof. All defendants benefited from the permanence of the women in the establishment as well as from the prostitution activities they were engaging in.It was not determined that prostitution activities the Thai nationals engaged in were imposed on them by force, coercion, deception, threats, or abuse of a vulnerable position. The Thai women always declared to have dedicated themselves to these activities voluntarily. Indeed, it was ascertained the women could move freely, leave the ‘La Boheme’ alone or in company of other people, had their passports and mobile phones that they could have used to ask for help if they so wished. Likewise, it was not determined that the Thai women were subjected to exploitative labour conditions (e.g. not allowed days off, not permitted to give up prostitution, excessive working hours) that would amount to a violation of the rights of workers. On 11 November 2009, law enforcement agents searched ‘La Boheme’, identified and led to the police station seven Thai women, including A., As., C., and D. After the initial questioning (before proper police and judicial authorities), the women were repatriated to Thailand. Their current whereabouts are unknown. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence as well as the outcome of searches on site. Legal findings:The Public Prosecution indicted the defendants for (i) aggravated migrant smuggling, (ii) enforced prostitution. Defendant 4 was further indicted for crimes against the rights of workers.The Audiencia Provincial de Burgos convicted the defendants of aggravated migrant smuggling (due to the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit). It sentenced each of the defendants to six years’ imprisonment. All defendants were acquitted of enforced prostitution. Defendant 4 was in addition acquitted of crimes against the rights of workers. The Supreme Court granted the appeal only in respect of the quantum of the penalty, having significantly reduced it. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The judgment decides the appeal presented by the defendants, Public Prosecutor and the National Tax Authority against a decision that inter alia failed to convict the defendants for crimes against the rights of foreign citizens (which comprises the smuggling of migrants). The appellants J. and G. (a couple) owned two businesses in Guadalajara (Spain): a Chinese restaurant and a dry fruits shop. They frequently travelled to China (specifically, the region of Zhejiang) with the purpose of recruiting people to travel to Spain and work in their businesses. In so doing, they targeted individuals facing very precarious economic, working and social circumstances in China. The appellants took on the responsibility for travel costs, accommodation and food. Conversely, the recruited workers would work for the appellants for three years and a half. During this period, the appellants retained the passport and residence permit card of the migrants. The workers would be paid 3 500 Euro for the period above-mentioned (three and a half years) plus 1000 Euro per additional year of work. The migrants were not entitled to holidays, and did not have a work schedule or specific tasks. They often worked 12 hours per day, with no weekly rest and no monthly payment. The defendants also manipulated contributions to Social Security. Migrants were subjected to work conditions determined in work contracts signed with third parties (unknown to authorities), who acted on behalf of the appellants. Therein it was stipulated that, in case of breach of contract, migrants would be bound to pay to the defendants 145 000 to 150 000 Yuans. Aware of the Spanish legislation on the entry of foreigners, J. and G. submitted to the competent governmental office the offers of employment that would trigger the procedures for obtaining visas and residence permits to the migrants. In order not to raise suspicions, J. and G. convinced defendant R. (administrator of a company operating in the field of real estate with who J. had business relations) to issue job offers and register them at the competent governmental office, knowing that the subjects of such offers would never perform for his company but rather in the businesses of J. and G. R. was aware of the illegal nature of the scheme set in place by J. and G. Some migrants were accommodated in the apartment where J. and G. lived with their children so as to keep them constantly under surveillance. At least 18 Chinese nationals were brought into Spain in the context of the described plan. J. and G. resorted to different strategies to integrate the profits derived from facilitating irregular migration and exploiting foreign workers in the lawful circuit of capitals, notably by acquiring various real estate. On 21 November 2007, the National Police inspected the restaurant property of appellants J. and G. It seized 47 320 Euro, 14 residence and work permit cards addressed to non EU citizens, one residence and work permit card belonging to a EU citizen, 10 ATM cards, 20 bank saving books, 11 Chinese passports, work contracts relating to the situation above described. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Guadalajaraconvicted the defendants for crimes against the rights of workers, money laundering and falsification of documents. It further ordered the confiscation of real estate allegedly acquired with proceeds of the crime. Both the defendants, on the one hand, and the Public Prosecutor and the National Tax Authority, on the other, appealed. The Supreme Court partially upheld the appeal of the defendants. It overturned the confiscation of assets as determined in first instance. It dismissed the appeal lodged by the Public Prosecutor, which inter alia pleaded for a conviction for crimes against the rights of foreign citizens.

"On 9 February 2015, at approximately 19.15, the defendant arrived to the cross-border post of Beni-Enzar, intending to enter Spain, driving a vehicle registered to a third party. Police authorities proceeded to inspect the vehicle. They by-passed the detector of heart beats, which repeatedly signalled close to the engine. Upon closer inspection, police officers discovered a key-tool under the drivers’ seat. With it, they were able to de-construct a cubicle built between the front bumper and the radiator. A man had been hidden inside, wrapped up in a blanket and plastic. An ambulance was called given that the migrant complained of numbness and presented accelerated respiration. The migrant admitted not to have the necessary documents to enter Spain and that he had paid 10 000 Dirhams (app. 1000 Euro) for the assistance of smugglers. Specifically, two other individuals had assisted him in entering the hidden compartment approximately 40 minutes before and had, subsequently, closed it.The defendant – who was initially calm – became increasingly nervous from the moment heart beats were detected close to the car’s engine. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied on testimonial evidence, including from the police officers involved in the inspection of the vehicle. The outcome of searches and seizures were particularly important given that the defendant was caught in flagrante delicto. Finally, expert evidence was also considered. Specifically, forensic experts testified on the dangers posed by the circumstances of the trip to the life and safety of the smuggled migrant.  Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor had requested that the defendant be sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment for aggravated migrant smuggling. The Provincial Court of Málaga (Spain) convicted the defendant of aggravated migrant smuggling, though it sentenced him to a sentence lower than the one claimed by the Prosecution. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The judgment decides the appeal presented by an individual (O.) against his conviction for trafficking in human beings and sexual aggression. Importantly, the defendant had been acquitted of crimes against the rights of foreign citizens (which comprises the smuggling of migrants). In the summer of 2012, the appellant – driver at the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in Spain – established contact with the victim (resident in Equatorial Guinea) via Facebook, offering to help her in acquiring a touristic visa to come to Spain, organise her travel, and assist her in permanently staying in the country. The true intention of the appellant was to force the victim to maintain sexual relations with him at his wish. The victim, unaware of the appellant’s purposes, accepted his help, relying on his occupation at the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea. In the documentation required to the issuance of the visa, notably in the invitation letter, the appellant falsely declared the victim was his niece. A 15-day touristic visa was issued. On 5 October 2012, the victim arrived to Madrid (Spain). She was received at the airport by relatives and remained at their house in Alcalá de Henares (Spain). The victim and the appellant communicated by phone and agreed to meet on 11 October 2012. On that date, the appellant picked up the victim. With the excuse of having a work related task to take care of in the local Hotel Ibis, he proceeded to this destination. He convinced the victim to go up to the bedroom where he allegedly would take care of business. There, he informed the victim of his true intentions and retained her passport. He stated that if she refused intercourse, he would act so that she was deported to her home country. Deprived of her passport, in a foreign country and fearing the appellant would denounce her to authorities and make her return to Equatorial Guinea, the victim submitted herself to sexual relations with the appellant, who was HIV positive. After intercourse, the appellant abandoned the victim in the hotel. She contacted relatives who then came to her rescue. The appellant reported the victim to authorities given her refusal to further engage in sexual relations. The victim suffered physical and psychological injuries, which required professional support. In the search to the residence of the appellant, authorities seized inter alia eight passports from Equatorial Guinea registered to different persons, a Spanish driving license and a residence permit of a third person. In ascertaining the facts, authorities considered the declarations of the victim, documental evidence (e.g. letter of invitation written by the appellant), declarations of the appellant (notably when denouncing the irregular situation of the victim to authorities), transcript of Facebook conversations, and testimony of witnesses. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Madridconvicted the defendants for trafficking in human beings and sexual aggression but acquitted him of crimes against the rights of foreign citizens, with which the defendant had been charged in ideal cumulation of crimes. In appeal, the Supreme Court ruled the conduct did not integrate the crime of trafficking in human beings. Rather, it convicted the appellant for crimes against the rights of foreign citizens.

"The judgment decides the appeal presented by an individual (D.) against his conviction for crimes against the rights of foreign citizens (which comprises the smuggling of migrants) and enforced prostitution. In 2005, the appellant contacted a woman in Goianas (Brazil), through the intermediary L. D. offered the said person to come to Spain to work in a cafeteria. D. argued he would pay for the travel. The woman accepted the offer given the difficult economic situation she was facing, namely as she was unemployed. With the funds provided by D., L. bought a return ticket for the woman Brazil – Spain – Brazil and arranged for hotel reservations. L. accompanied the woman and adverted her to say in the border control that the trip was for tourism purposes only. The woman was collected in Bilbao airport by the appellant, who took her to Asturias (Spain), to a brothel. He informed her that she was really to work as a prostitute. He stressed she had to do so as she had a debt of 3600 Euro towards him, for the costs of the travel. The woman cried for several days and refused to work as a prostitute. The appellant took her to another brothel where she was locked in, as she did not know the door codes. She was allowed out only in the company of “reliable women”. The woman was forced to work as a prostitute until she managed to escape and denounced her situation to the Police in Dijón (Spain), on 27 July 2005. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Oviedo convicted the defendant for crimes against the rights of workers and enforced prostitution. The Supreme Court partially overturned the appealed decision, reducing the penalty for migrant smuggling from two to one year imprisonment.

"Date(s) of offending: From 14 May 2012 to TBC.The defendants developed a plan to ensure that Defendants 2 and 3 would be able to create the appearance of legally entering and residing in Spain by pretending to be the sons of Defendant 1. To this effect, with the assistance of a third-party in Gambia, Defendants 2 and 3 were officially registered, on 27 October 2009, in the pertinent State services as children of Defendant 1.On 14 May 2012, Defendants 2 and 3 requested family reunification with Defendant 1, in line with the applicable regime in the European Union. Defendant 1 confirmed and consented to the requests. They submitted false birth certificates. Consequently, the Regional Government of Aragón (Spain) issued to Defendants 2 and 3 a residence permit.Throughout investigations, law-enforcement authorities ascertained that Defendant 2 held two passports: an authentic one and a fraudulent one, whereby the fingerprint was a scanned copy of that in the real passport.Three other individuals (not defendants in the proceedings under analysis) were “reunited” with Defendant 1 under the same scheme.    In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied on testimonial and documentary evidence. Courts also took into account the defendants’ refusal in submitting themselves to DNA testing. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Zaragoza (Spain) convicted Defendant 1 of migrant smuggling and falsification of documents. Defendants 2 and 3 were convicted of falsification of documents.The Supreme Court upheld the appeal only in respect of the quantum of penalty imposed to Defendant 1. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"In September 2011, it was reported to authorities that a Pakistani individual – later identified as Defendant 1 – was member of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and weapons from France to Spain. Specifically, he would transport irregular migrants - arriving by train to Toulouse (France) - to Spain, in a Volkswagen van. He used to cross the border between 15.00 and 19.00. Authorities began monitoring Defendant 1 and were able to confirm he further often drove a vehicle Renault. On 17 October 2011, police officers followed Defendant 1, who crossed the border to France and later returned to Lleida (Spain), with two additional individuals. The vehicle was lost in the traffic of this city. On 23 October 2011, the Volkswagen and Renault travelled to France, one following the other, through the border crossing point of Les-Puente del Rey. Accordingly, authorities decided to prepare a control operation on site with the purpose of intercepting the vehicles, upon their return to Spain. At approximately 16.40 of the same day, the Renault was intercepted, being driven by Defendant 2. It carried functions of reconnaissance. Around 17.00, Defendant 1 was intercepted driving the Volkswagen and transporting eight irregular migrants (four Pakistani, one Indian and three Nepalese). Seven of the latter had reached Europe (Italy, France or Germany) by sea, in containers, from their countries of origin. The irregular migrants were then transferred by truck to the surroundings of the cross border area of Les-Puente del Rey, collected by Defendant 1, with the aim of leading them to Lleida.Defendant 1 was detained during the traffic control operation afore-mentioned.Authorities were able to determine that Defendant 1 was member of an organised criminal group, being in regular contract with several associates, some of whom not identified. The said criminal group, upon payment of considerable fees, ensured the smuggling of migrants – mostly from India, Pakistan and Nepal – to European countries, by sea, in containers. They would then ensure their transit by land until the wished country of destination. Sometimes, they were left close the train or bus stations. Other times, they remained few days in ‘safe houses’ until the arrangement of the necessary documentation so that the smuggled migrants could regularise their situation in Spain. In some instances, Defendant 1, in agreement with associates in the organised criminal group, resorted to Pakistani and Hindu individuals settled in England, who collected the migrants arriving to that country. They would then arrange for the follow-up of the smuggling venture, for instance, by providing train or bus tickets that led the migrants to a specified collection point or simply to their city or country of election.After paying a 6000 Euro bail, Defendant 1 was released but continued to pursue his illegal activities, this time exploring alternative routes to Les-Puente del Rey. Investigations detected interactions of Defendant 1 with another smuggler known for having dedicated 36 years to the smuggling of migrants to France, Spain and Portugal. On 9 February 2012, Defendant 1 was observed participating in another smuggling venture, this time not only facilitating the irregular transit of migrants but also providing accommodation thereto in his residence.On 5 March 2012, ten people were detained in the bus station of San Sebastian (Spain). They had paid considerable sums to be smuggled from England into Spain.It was not determined that Defendant 2 perceived any profit for the assistance given to Defendant 1. The other defendants were deemed to have provided some form of support to the activities led by Defendant 1, including facilitating work in the black market to irregular migrants or promoting sham marriages.In ascertain the facts, authorities relied on testimonial evidence, the outcome of electronic surveillance as well as search and seizure operations. In the course of the latter, important documentary evidence of the criminal activities engaged in by the defendants (and the organised criminal group) were discovered in their residence and other locations frequented by them.  Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor had requested that (i) Defendant 1 be sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for migrant smuggling, (ii) Defendant 2 be sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for migrant smuggling, (iii) the remaining defendants be sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment for the crime of concealment. The Provincial Court of Lleida (Spain) convicted the defendants thought it applied sentences lower than the ones claimed by the Prosecution. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"Date(s) of offending: on/from 1 Aug 2004 to 1 Aug 2004At the early hours of 1 August 2004, the defendant initiated swimming from a point in the coast of Morocco towards Ceuta (Spanish autonomous city located in the north coast of Africa). He did so while towing an undocumented migrant, national of Cameroon, who had paid him an undetermined fee to the effect. The defendant was equipped with a neoprene suit and fins. The migrant was himself equipped with a neoprene suit and a floating device. The defendant’s purpose was to facilitate the illegal entry of the irregular migrant in Spain.Both individuals were detected by an officer of the Guardia Civil - who was, at the time, in a surveillance tower in the border control post – via a night vision device. The Maritime Service of the Civil Police was immediately informed of the occurrence.At the time, the weather was foggy and windy. The sea presented slight to medium turbulence.A patrol of the Maritime Service of the Guardia Civil searched for the defendant and the irregular migrant at sea. They were detected at approximately 3.30 a.m., at roughly one mile off the coast of Ceuta. They were rescued into the ship of the Guardia Civil and detained.The defendant denied to have perceived any financial or other material benefit for his ‘services’. He declared that himself was an irregular migrant attempting to enter in Spain. This notwithstanding, both the defendant and the irregular migrant confirmed the latter had bought the neoprene suit the defendant wore in exchange for his help in reaching Spanish territory. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence (from the defendant and irregular migrant as well as the law-enforcement officers involved in their detection, rescue and detention). Documental evidence was equally considered. Notably, in order to substantiate the dangers for the life of the irregular migrant, it was pondered a certified list of individuals that had died in 2003 and 2004 (thus far) while attempting to reach Spain via a modus operandi similar to the one employed by the defendant. Legal findings: The Audiencia Provincial de Cádiz (Spain)convicted the defendant of migrant smuggling. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,0
"The judgment decides the appeal presented by five individuals against their conviction in first instance for crimes against the rights of foreign citizens (which comprises the smuggling of migrants).On 21 April 2013, the Guardia Civil of Melilla (Spain) was informed that a ship carrying 12 to 15 sub-Saharan migrants, in provenance from Morocco, was directed to Melilla. Two duly identified zodiacs of the Guardia Civil were deployed to assist the migrants. The latter were detected at app. 1,5 miles from the coast of Melilla. C. was helming the migrants boat. The boat had no safety devices and no means of communication that allowed locating the boat. The sea was turbulent and none of the migrants knew how to swim. Most migrants could not be identified as they lacked documents. Once reaching the migrants boat, the authorities asked several times the defendants to stop the boat. As the request was ignored, the officers halted the boat. The defendants proceeded to attack the Spanish officers with batons and a knife. Six officers suffered injuries to the fingers and abdomen. When the boat reached the beach, the defendants and migrants tried to escape. They were detained by authorities. The damages to the zodiacs were estimated in 2671 Euro. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Màlaga convicted appellant C. for crimes against the rights of foreign citizens. C. and the remaining four appellants were convicted of offences to physical integrity and damages to property.In appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the court of first instance.

"Date(s) of offending: 28 December 2012On 28 December 2012, at approximately 8.40, the appellant attempted to drive his vehicle from Morocco to Melilla (Spain), through the border post of Beni-Enzar. The defendant had a co-pilot, who he had previously hired to transport merchandise from Melilla to Morocco (acquitted).Law-enforcement agents were, at the moment, carrying out an operation of checks and control over vehicles. In this context, they discovered a hidden compartment in the defendant’s car, between the trunk and the bumper. This hiding cubicle was not perceptible from the exterior. It was made of a metal sheet shaped and hold with screws. Inside, police officers found a Guinean national without the necessary documentation to legally enter and stay in Spain.In order to remove the irregular migrant from the cubicle, it was necessary to proceed to its de-construction. The irregular migrant was found hyperventilating and over-sweating.Third parties had paid 150 Euro to the defendant for the facilitation of smuggling venture. The defendant admitted to be a drug addict and that he intended to use the profit for acquiring and consuming drugs, given the physical and psychological dependency thereto. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied significantly on testimonial evidence, notably the confession of the appellant. Likewise, expert evidence (medical reports asserting the risks posed to the life of the irregular migrant in view of the modus operandi used)and the outcome of searches and seizures were of much significance. In respect of the latter, this was all more so the case given that the defendant was caught in flagrante delicto. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Málaga (Spain) convicted the defendantof aggravated migrant smuggling. The aggravating circumstances equated to (i) purpose of obtaining financial or other material benefit, (ii) endangering life and or safety of smuggled migrant.The Supreme Court upheld the appeal only as far as the quantum of penalty was concerned. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1
"Defendant 1 requested Spanish nationality in 2004, declaring before the competent State services to have three minor children. In 2007, Defendant 1 was awarded the nationality. He then stated to the competent civil services to have two other children in addition to those declared in 2004, one living in Gambia (I., 21 years old) and the other (minor) in Zaragoza residing with the Defendant himself.Defendant 1 married his wife in Gambia in 1993. It was determined during investigations that the couple indeed had had the four minor children. Defendant 1 had previously requested family reunification of an individual Defendant 1 identified as his son (J.M, born in 1987, in Gambia). The latter received his residence permit in Spain in 2001.The three defendants in the instant case were accused of having developed a plot to enable Defendants 2 and 3 to enter and stay in Spain, posing as sons of Defendant 1 and, consequently, applying for the family reunification institute in force in the European Union and, ultimately, obtaining work in the country. To this effect, Defendants 2 and 3 managed – through the assistance of a third person – to be registered as sons of Defendant 1 in Gambia’s Civil Registry, on 27 October 2009. The registration was made by the same civil servant. On the basis of the corresponding certificates, Defendants 2 and 3 requested family reunification with Defendant 1, on 14 May 2012. In the context of these proceedings, Defendant 1 confirmed to be the father of Defendants 2 and 3. To support the proceedings, Defendants 2 and 3 presented fraudulent documents, namely authentic passports belonging to a third party where the fingerprints’ page had been replaced by that of the defendants. At least three other individuals were “reunited” in Spain under the same scheme. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied on testimonial evidence, whereby the defendants denied to have committed a crime. Notably, they insisted on the alleged father-child relationship. They justified the inconsistencies in their statements with the fact that, after their mother’ death in Gambia, Defendants 2 and 3 had been separated and did not see each other regularly. The defendants refused being submitted to DNA testing. Documentary evidence was further considered.  Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor had requested that (i) Defendant 1 be sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment for migrant smuggling and falsification of documents, (ii) Defendants 2 and 3 be sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and fine of 12 months at the daily rate of 8 Euro for falsification of documents. The Provincial Court of Zaragoza (Spain) convicted the defendants accordingly, though applying fines at a daily rate lower than the ones claimed by the Prosecution. For further details see “Commentary”.",smuggling of migrants,1

In some instances, Defendant 1, in agreement with associates in the organised criminal group, resorted to Pakistani and Hindu individuals settled in England, who collected the migrants arriving to that country. They would then arrange for the follow-up of the smuggling venture, for instance, by providing train or bus tickets that led the migrants to a specified collection point or simply to their city or country of election.After paying a 6000 Euro bail, Defendant 1 was released but continued to pursue his illegal activities, this time exploring alternative routes to Les-Puente del Rey. Investigations detected interactions of Defendant 1 with another smuggler known for having dedicated 36 years to the smuggling of migrants to France, Spain and Portugal. On 9 February 2012, Defendant 1 was observed participating in another smuggling venture, this time not only facilitating the irregular transit of migrants but also providing accommodation thereto in his residence.On 5 March 2012, ten people were detained in the bus station of San Sebastian (Spain). They had paid considerable sums to be smuggled from England into Spain.It was not determined that Defendant 2 perceived any profit for the assistance given to Defendant 1. The other defendants were deemed to have provided some form of support to the activities led by Defendant 1, including facilitating work in the black market to irregular migrants or promoting sham marriages.In ascertain the facts, authorities relied on testimonial evidence, the outcome of electronic surveillance as well as search and seizure operations. In the course of the latter, important documentary evidence of the criminal activities engaged in by the defendants (and the organised criminal group) were discovered in their residence and other locations frequented by them.  Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor had requested that (i) Defendant 1 be sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for migrant smuggling, (ii) Defendant 2 be sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for migrant smuggling, (iii) the remaining defendants be sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment for the crime of concealment. The Provincial Court of Lleida (Spain) convicted the defendants thought it applied sentences lower than the ones claimed by the Prosecution. For further details see “Commentary”.",trafficking in firearms,1
"In 2000, the defendant resided in Madrid (Spain). He used to receive in his residence women in provenance from Moldova that irregularly entered the country with fraudulent passports procured by third parties. The women had gone to Spain under promises of work as dancers, under appealing labour conditions and remuneration. However, once in Spain, they were informed to have contracted a debt in the amount of 20 000 Euro.Upon arrival, the defendant seized the women’s passport and accompanied them to the envisaged place of work: sex establishments. The women were paid daily on the basis of the consumption of clients. They also received a weekly salary. The entirety of their income was to be handed to the defendant who then delivered it to a third person.Several women were heard by authorities. They confirmed the facts above described and further stated to have engaged in sexual relations with the defendant. Some stated to have been forced to do so, others declared they had to engage in such practices in order to receive gifts or privileged treatment.On 12 December 2000, authorities carried out a search operation to the residence of the defendant. They seized seven authentic Polish passports, and one authentic Polish ID card, all belonging to women. The original pictures had been replaced by those of the smuggled migrants/victims in the instant case. Authorities further found evidence of wire transfers made by the defendant in favour of an individual in Moldova in the amounts of 481 800, 209 215, 207 965, 498 997, 39 798, and 452 018 Pesetas. Likewise, the following was found: (i) work shifts and schedules with the names of women and work sites, (ii) list of women’s names, their passport numbers and addresses in the respective home countries. The defendant was living with eight women (irregular migrants).On 25 November 2004, an arrest warrant was issued against the defendant. Yet, he could not be retrieved. His arrest took place on 20 July 2016.The defendant denied the accusations. Rather, it maintained to have merely assisted fellow nationals, who had gone to Spain and found themselves in precarious situation. He declared never to have threatened or paid the victims to have intercourse with him. Fearful for their safety, he would have accompanied the women to and from their place of work and – in an act of friendship – go shopping for them. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence and the outcome of search and seizure operations. Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor accused the defendant of migrant smuggling, unlawful detention, sexual aggression (continuous offence), and crimes against the rights of workers. As far as migrant smuggling is concerned, the Public Prosecution requested the defendant to be sentenced to five years imprisonment and fine of 24 months at the daily rate of 7 Euro.The Provincial Court of Madrid acquitted the defendant. For further details see “Commentary",trafficking in persons,1
"Date(s) of offending: on/from 2009 to TBC - at least, 2011Defendant 1, originally from Nigeria, addressed in that country a woman (D.) of humble origins, promising work and a better life in Spain for a fee of 30 000 Euro. With that purpose, D. left to Morocco, where she remained nearly three years waiting for Defendant 1 to bring her to Spain. Finally, in 2009, Defendant 1 facilitated the illegal entry of D. and her five year old child, by sea, in Algeciras (Spain) for the price of 18 000 Euro. D. then travelled to Madrid (Spain) by bus, where she was received by Defendant 1. They immediately travelled by plane to Gran Canaria (Spain). D. used the passport of another person, which was given to her by Defendant 1.D. lodged in the residence of Defendant 1, together with the latter’s husband (Defendant 2) and another woman.D. was immediately forced to work as a prostitute by Defendants 1 and 2 as well as Defendant 3 (brother of Defendant 1) so as to pay the costs of the travel to Spain, allegedly in the amount of 18 000 Euro. Furthermore, D. should pay the costs of living, notably (i) 125 Euro for water and electricity, (ii) 50 Euro for food, (iii) 200 Euro rent. In addition, she was to pay 300 Euro to Defendant 3 for taking care of her child while she was working as a prostitute. Both D. and her son were physically abused as a means of forcing D. into prostitution. Likewise, she was threatened with harm on her and her relatives, notably though voodoo rituals. In this manner, the Defendants managed that D. always delivered the total amount of her gains at the end of the day. Defendant 2 was in charge of taking note of the payments done. Victim N. became acquainted with Defendant 1 in Morocco. The latter promised the former work in a supermarket in Spain. In exchange for a money fee, Defendant 1 organised the illegal entry of N. in Spain, by sea. She arrived in Granada (Spain) in 2011, together with her son. She met an intermediary of Defendant 1 in Madrid, who delivered her false documentation so she could be able to board a plane to Gran Canaria on 2 April 2011. N. was then received by Defendant 1 and taken to the latter’s residence. She was forced into prostitution by all Defendants with the alleged purpose of paying the costs of the travel (in the reported amount of 30 000 Euro). N. was threatened with serious harm to her, her child, and close relatives, though she was never actually physically abused.Every night, D. and N. left the residence of Defendants 1 and 2 towards a designated area where they worked as prostitutes from 00.00 to 06.00. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied on testimonial evidence and electronic surveillance (telephone bugging). Documental evidence was also considered. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain)convicted Defendant 1of crimes against the rights of foreign citizens, enforced prostitution and trafficking in human beings. It convicted Defendants 2 and 3 of enforced prostitution.The Supreme Court reduced the term of imprisonment for migrant smuggling (i.e., crimes against the rights of foreign citizens) from 4 years to 1-year imprisonment. It upheld the remaining of the appealed decision. For further details see “Commentary”.",trafficking in persons,0
"On 11 November 2009, the Embassy of Thailand in Spain received a phone call whereby it was alleged that six women were being held at a certain location and forced into prostitution. Two of the women had managed to escape and sought the assistance of the Embassy of Thailand. The Consul of Thailand addressed the Police in Burgos (Spain) asking for an investigation. The facts of the case are as follows. Four Thai women (A., As. C. and D.) approached a group of people in Thailand with the purpose of receiving assistance in entering Spain illegally. The said group of people procured to the women visas, plane tickets, hotel reservations, and some cash – between 100 Euro and 200 Euro – so that, in the course of border control proceedings, they could give the appearance of solvency for the period they were supposed to remain in Spain. The Thai women thus engaged in debts ranging between 15 000 Euro and 17 000 Euro for the costs of travel and documentation. They were supposed to pay for it with the proceeds of their work in Spain. Two of the women (A. and As.) had gone to Spain with the intent of working as prostitutes. The third one (C.) – while having been offered work as massagist – agreed to work in prostitution upon her arrival in Spain. Finally, the fourth woman (D.) was intended to work as a waitress. She never engaged in prostitution notably because the day after her arrival in Spain occurred the police operation that underpinned the instant case.A. arrived to the airport f Madrid-Barajas (Spain) on 17 September 2009. She was collected by Defendant 2 (life partner of one of the persons the four Thai women had approached in Thailand in order to receive assistance in entering Spain illegally) and with whom she had a child. As. Arrived at the same airport on 18 September, having been collected by Defendants 2 and 3. Defendants 2 and 3 immediately transported both women, in a van, to the Club ‘La Boheme’, approximately 234 Km away from Madrid, close to Burgos, where they settled.C. arrived to the airport of Barcelona (Spain) on 29 October 2009. She was collected by Defendant 1. The latter accompanied the irregular migrant to the bus station, bought her a ticket to Burgos. Upon arrival, C. was collected by Defendants 2 and 6.D. arrived to the airport of Madrid- Barajas on 10 November 2009. She was collected by Defendant 1. The same follow-up procedure as that adopted in respect of C. was engaged. C. and D. were also immediately accommodated in the Club ‘La Boheme’.A., As., and C. started prostituting themselves in ‘La Boheme’ the day after their arrival. The Club kept 50% of the price of beverages clients invited them to. When clients wished to engage in sexual relations, Defendant 5 charged them 5 Euro for a packet composed of one bed sheet, one towel, one condom. The bedroom and sexual services price amounted to 50 Euro. This fee was allocated to the payment of the women’s debt towards the defendants. Importantly, the women were charged 50 Euro per day for accommodation and maintenance at ‘La Boheme’.‘La Boheme’ was managed by Defendant 4. The latter was the administrator of a company dedicated to the creation and development inter alia of hotels, bars, leisure centres. He was regularly present at the ‘La Boheme’. Defendant 2 was also a cook in this establishment while Defendant 6 worked both as waiter and security thereof. Defendant 3 was an employee of ‘La Boheme’, working as driver and in the maintenance of the establishment. Defendant 5 worked as receptionist of the section of ‘La Boheme’ where the four Thai women lived and exercised prostitution. She was thus the one usually receiving payments from clients regarding services supplied by the Thai women.All defendants were fully aware the Thai women (i) had entered Spain illegally, (ii) had incurred into considerable debt as a consequence thereof. All defendants benefited from the permanence of the women in the establishment as well as from the prostitution activities they were engaging in.It was not determined that prostitution activities the Thai nationals engaged in were imposed on them by force, coercion, deception, threats, or abuse of a vulnerable position. The Thai women always declared to have dedicated themselves to these activities voluntarily. Indeed, it was ascertained the women could move freely, leave the ‘La Boheme’ alone or in company of other people, had their passports and mobile phones that they could have used to ask for help if they so wished. Likewise, it was not determined that the Thai women were subjected to exploitative labour conditions (e.g. not allowed days off, not permitted to give up prostitution, excessive working hours) that would amount to a violation of the rights of workers. On 11 November 2009, law enforcement agents searched ‘La Boheme’, identified and led to the police station seven Thai women, including A., As., C., and D. After the initial questioning (before proper police and judicial authorities), the women were repatriated to Thailand. Their current whereabouts are unknown. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence as well as the outcome of searches on site. Legal findings:The Public Prosecution indicted the defendants for (i) aggravated migrant smuggling, (ii) enforced prostitution. Defendant 4 was further indicted for crimes against the rights of workers.The Audiencia Provincial de Burgos convicted the defendants of aggravated migrant smuggling (due to the intent of obtaining a financial or other material benefit). It sentenced each of the defendants to six years’ imprisonment. All defendants were acquitted of enforced prostitution. Defendant 4 was in addition acquitted of crimes against the rights of workers. The Supreme Court granted the appeal only in respect of the quantum of the penalty, having significantly reduced it. For further details see “Commentary”.",trafficking in persons,1
"The judgment decides the appeal presented by an individual (O.) against his conviction for trafficking in human beings and sexual aggression. Importantly, the defendant had been acquitted of crimes against the rights of foreign citizens (which comprises the smuggling of migrants). In the summer of 2012, the appellant – driver at the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea in Spain – established contact with the victim (resident in Equatorial Guinea) via Facebook, offering to help her in acquiring a touristic visa to come to Spain, organise her travel, and assist her in permanently staying in the country. The true intention of the appellant was to force the victim to maintain sexual relations with him at his wish. The victim, unaware of the appellant’s purposes, accepted his help, relying on his occupation at the Embassy of Equatorial Guinea. In the documentation required to the issuance of the visa, notably in the invitation letter, the appellant falsely declared the victim was his niece. A 15-day touristic visa was issued. On 5 October 2012, the victim arrived to Madrid (Spain). She was received at the airport by relatives and remained at their house in Alcalá de Henares (Spain). The victim and the appellant communicated by phone and agreed to meet on 11 October 2012. On that date, the appellant picked up the victim. With the excuse of having a work related task to take care of in the local Hotel Ibis, he proceeded to this destination. He convinced the victim to go up to the bedroom where he allegedly would take care of business. There, he informed the victim of his true intentions and retained her passport. He stated that if she refused intercourse, he would act so that she was deported to her home country. Deprived of her passport, in a foreign country and fearing the appellant would denounce her to authorities and make her return to Equatorial Guinea, the victim submitted herself to sexual relations with the appellant, who was HIV positive. After intercourse, the appellant abandoned the victim in the hotel. She contacted relatives who then came to her rescue. The appellant reported the victim to authorities given her refusal to further engage in sexual relations. The victim suffered physical and psychological injuries, which required professional support. In the search to the residence of the appellant, authorities seized inter alia eight passports from Equatorial Guinea registered to different persons, a Spanish driving license and a residence permit of a third person. In ascertaining the facts, authorities considered the declarations of the victim, documental evidence (e.g. letter of invitation written by the appellant), declarations of the appellant (notably when denouncing the irregular situation of the victim to authorities), transcript of Facebook conversations, and testimony of witnesses. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Madridconvicted the defendants for trafficking in human beings and sexual aggression but acquitted him of crimes against the rights of foreign citizens, with which the defendant had been charged in ideal cumulation of crimes. In appeal, the Supreme Court ruled the conduct did not integrate the crime of trafficking in human beings. Rather, it convicted the appellant for crimes against the rights of foreign citizens.

"Date(s) of offending: on/from 2003 to 23 January 2004The civil police of Melilla (Spain) was informed by the Moroccan police that a certain vehicle (van type, identified by manufacturer, model and licence number) had been intercepted in the border crossing point of Beni-Enzar (Morocco) transporting undocumented sub-Saharan migrants. A third individual (not subject to the proceedings in casu) was driving the vehicle. The purpose had been to facilitate the illegal entry of said migrants in Spain. On the basis of such information, the Spanish police attempted to ascertain whether the vehicle had been previously used in the smuggling of migrants into Spain. Through SIAM - Sistema de Identificación Automática de Matrícula(Automated System of Identification of Licenses), it was confirmed that the vehicle had crossed the border to Spain on 15 April 2012, through the border post of Farhana (Morocco). It was further determined that on 16 April 2012, two sub-Saharan migrants (H. and R.) had been registered in CETI - Centro de Estancia Temporal de Inmigrantes (Centre of Temporary Stay for Migrants). No relationship was confirmed between such migrants and the defendants. This notwithstanding, the vehicle was registered in the name of Defendant 2 and the irregular migrants spent one night in a farm property of Defendant 1 (where the latter had his residence).  In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence. Notably, irregular migrant H. recognised the vehicle they travelled in as being the one previously identified by the Moroccan police as well as the point of entry in Spain. She further identified the place where the migrants had spent one night as being the farm property of Defendant 2. It is relevant to note that this identification process was carried out before the Guardia Civilrather than the Criminal Police, via photographs. It was submitted the defendants integrated an organised criminal group. Legal findings:The Audiencia Provincial de Málaga (Spain)acquitted the defendants of crimes against the rights of foreign citizens. For further details see “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,0
"In September 2011, it was reported to authorities that a Pakistani individual – later identified as Defendant 1 – was member of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants and weapons from France to Spain. Specifically, he would transport irregular migrants - arriving by train to Toulouse (France) - to Spain, in a Volkswagen van. He used to cross the border between 15.00 and 19.00. Authorities began monitoring Defendant 1 and were able to confirm he further often drove a vehicle Renault. On 17 October 2011, police officers followed Defendant 1, who crossed the border to France and later returned to Lleida (Spain), with two additional individuals. The vehicle was lost in the traffic of this city. On 23 October 2011, the Volkswagen and Renault travelled to France, one following the other, through the border crossing point of Les-Puente del Rey. Accordingly, authorities decided to prepare a control operation on site with the purpose of intercepting the vehicles, upon their return to Spain. At approximately 16.40 of the same day, the Renault was intercepted, being driven by Defendant 2. It carried functions of reconnaissance. Around 17.00, Defendant 1 was intercepted driving the Volkswagen and transporting eight irregular migrants (four Pakistani, one Indian and three Nepalese). Seven of the latter had reached Europe (Italy, France or Germany) by sea, in containers, from their countries of origin. The irregular migrants were then transferred by truck to the surroundings of the cross border area of Les-Puente del Rey, collected by Defendant 1, with the aim of leading them to Lleida.Defendant 1 was detained during the traffic control operation afore-mentioned.Authorities were able to determine that Defendant 1 was member of an organised criminal group, being in regular contract with several associates, some of whom not identified. The said criminal group, upon payment of considerable fees, ensured the smuggling of migrants – mostly from India, Pakistan and Nepal – to European countries, by sea, in containers. They would then ensure their transit by land until the wished country of destination. Sometimes, they were left close the train or bus stations. Other times, they remained few days in ‘safe houses’ until the arrangement of the necessary documentation so that the smuggled migrants could regularise their situation in Spain. In some instances, Defendant 1, in agreement with associates in the organised criminal group, resorted to Pakistani and Hindu individuals settled in England, who collected the migrants arriving to that country. They would then arrange for the follow-up of the smuggling venture, for instance, by providing train or bus tickets that led the migrants to a specified collection point or simply to their city or country of election.After paying a 6000 Euro bail, Defendant 1 was released but continued to pursue his illegal activities, this time exploring alternative routes to Les-Puente del Rey. Investigations detected interactions of Defendant 1 with another smuggler known for having dedicated 36 years to the smuggling of migrants to France, Spain and Portugal. On 9 February 2012, Defendant 1 was observed participating in another smuggling venture, this time not only facilitating the irregular transit of migrants but also providing accommodation thereto in his residence.On 5 March 2012, ten people were detained in the bus station of San Sebastian (Spain). They had paid considerable sums to be smuggled from England into Spain.It was not determined that Defendant 2 perceived any profit for the assistance given to Defendant 1. The other defendants were deemed to have provided some form of support to the activities led by Defendant 1, including facilitating work in the black market to irregular migrants or promoting sham marriages.In ascertain the facts, authorities relied on testimonial evidence, the outcome of electronic surveillance as well as search and seizure operations. In the course of the latter, important documentary evidence of the criminal activities engaged in by the defendants (and the organised criminal group) were discovered in their residence and other locations frequented by them.  Legal findings:The Public Prosecutor had requested that (i) Defendant 1 be sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for migrant smuggling, (ii) Defendant 2 be sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for migrant smuggling, (iii) the remaining defendants be sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment for the crime of concealment. The Provincial Court of Lleida (Spain) convicted the defendants thought it applied sentences lower than the ones claimed by the Prosecution. For further details see “Commentary”.",participation in organized criminal group,1

"Miroslava T. T., Yulia T.

The defendents recruited the victims by means of extortion, massive violence, penalties for not satisfactoring sexwork and threats in Bulgaria and arranged the transfer and accommodation in brothels in Graz. In Graz the defendents took the main part of the earnings from prostitution of the victims. They told them time, place, type of performing prostitution and which clients they should serve.

"In July and August 2015, Christian T. and Kurt K. drove up to 31 foreign nationals, without EU rights of residence, from Vienna to the German border in their taxis.The incident was brought to the attention of the Regional Court of Wels, which decided that an arrest warrant should be issued as the court suggested that there was reasonable suspicion that they had committed the offence of migrant smuggling. Both men were arrested and charged for smuggling of migrants according to § 114 Abs 1, Abs 3 Z 1, Z 2 Fremdenpolizeigesetz (Alien’s Police Act), which defines the offence as facilitating the illicit entry or transit of foreign nationals (actus rea) with intent of gaining an unlawful material benefit (mens rea).Regarding the actus rea the facts suggested that Christian T. and Kurt K. did in fact facilitate the illicit transit of foreign nationals, but what about the mens rea, as the two men were only paid their normal taxi fees?Christian T. sought to overturn his arrest warrant but his complaint was subsequently rejected by the Court of Second Instance. However, when the matter was brought before the Austrian High Court, the decision to place both men under arrest was overturned, as the mens rea element was not properly established and therefore no urgent suspicion was given.The High Court ruled that intention to gain an unlawful material benefit does not only require a perpetrator to obtain a fee, but that the obtained fee exceeds the adequate extent. Only then shall a perpetrator be criminally liable for the offence of migrant smuggling. The facts of the case however suggested that the agreed fee for a taxi ride of this length was adequate. As such, the Austrian High Court concluded that there has been no reasonable suspicion that the offence of migrant smuggling had taken place in this instance and went on to overrule the arrest warrants against Christian T. and Kurt K.",smuggling of migrants,1

The men were part of a group of asylum-seekers who sought refuge in Austria and protested against the Austrian Government's decision to refuse refugee status. They were then temporarily accommodated in the Servitenkloster, a monastery in Vienna's 9th district, when the accusations against them emerged, triggering great publicity of this case.

"The Defendant was part of a Bulgarian criminal organization, which dominated the open street prostitution in Vienna to a considerable extent. He was primarily responsible for the “buying and selling” of prostitutes within the criminal group. The defendant, through improper means (including the abuse of the position of vulnerability of the Victims, who had no other living or working possibilities in a foreign Country), recruited, transported and harboured numerous Bulgarian nationals to work in Vienna as prostitutes.In particular, he bought Victim 1 from her former pimp paying a fee of 600-700 Euro; when she tried to escape with a man she had a relationship with, the Defendant threatened her that he would kill her son and set fire to her house in Bulgaria if she did not return to him to work as a prostitute.Victim 2 had initially agreed to move to Vienna to be a prostitute, but the Defendant deceived her as to the working conditions. In particular, they had agreed they would split the revenues 50:50 but Victim 2 could only retain a very small amount of her earnings, being forced to hand over to the Defendant the rest.The Defendant collaborated with other members of the criminal organization (including some relatives) in the purchasing of Victim 3, Victim 4, Victim 6 and Victim 7, for fees varying from 600 to 1800 Euro.Victim 5 was firstly sold by the Defendant to another pimp and was then received back, in order to sell her again later.In most cases, the Defendant was also in charge of transporting Victims from Bulgaria to Vienna, using a vehicle to drive them across the border.The Defendant was the pimp of Victim 1, Victim 2 and Victim 3: he gave them precise instructions for the exercise of prostitution, such as working hours, location and prices. He and other members of the association closely monitored the Victims (as well as other prostitutes working for members of the criminal organization), calling them periodically  to know how many clients they had had and observing them on the streets.During a visit to another member of the criminal organization, the Defendant expressed the wish to sleep with one of “his” prostitutes, Victim 8. When she refused, she was beaten by both men until she gave up resistance and had sexual intercourse with the Defendant. Victim 8 had to accept to have sexual intercourse with the Defendant on at least two other occasions, but offered no more resistance since she was scared she would be beaten like the first time. Subsequently, the Defendant received a call by Victim 8’s pimp, who asked him to threaten Victim 8, since she was refusing to continue work as a prostitute. During this phone call (which was recorded by the investigators), the Defendant threatened to strangle her with a wire.",trafficking in persons,1

When she returned half an hour later she found her 1-month-old baby missing. She immediately informed her husband, and the father of the missing baby, and they both commenced a search. Their search led them to the road leading to “Rabuor trading centre” where they were informed that two women had been spotted carrying a baby. They soon thereafter encountered two women (Christine Atieno Ochieng and Lilian Akinyi alias Salome, the defandants).  They saw them entered a maize plantation only to leave the baby in the plantation.  The two women then emerged and walked towards the trading centre, where they were apprehended. The baby was retrieved from the plantation and returned to its parents.",other crimes,1
"Defendant was a foreign businessman legally residing in Kenya. In May 2016, the Defendant was accused of trafficking eleven persons. The trafficked persons were received by one Kashif who was to organize their travel to Bangladesh, while other victims were to travel to Brazil.  The Defendant accommodated the victims on commercial terms by renting a house and subletting it to the victims. Eight victims stayed at the Defendant’s house, for which they paid him 10 dollars a day as they awaited Kashif to help them go to Brazil.",trafficking in persons,1
"The victim accompanied K.M. (the 2nd appellant) to Gichegere to collect her shoes, which K.M. had taken away. They met with J.F. (the 1st appellant) on the way, and arrived at K.M.’s home at 7pm. Later in the evening, J.F. came to K.M.’s home.  K.M. then asked the victim to go with J.F. to his home and collect alcohol for her.They both left and did not return, as J.F. allegedly locked the victim in his house and sexually abused her. A woman came to the house inquiring about the noise and screams (presumably the victim’s screams), but J.F. threatened her. The victim slept at J.F.’s house until the morning, when she escaped while the appellant was out buying milk. The victim then went to a nearby home, where a woman gave her a skirt to wear and took her to the subarea. She was then taken to hospital and the matter was reported to the police.",trafficking in persons,1
"Beatrice Akomo Ongito, the appellant in this case and the defendant in the first instance, is also the victim’s older sister. On the 1st of October 2008, the appellant went to the victim’s house and told her that the victim’s husband had sent a message through her, saying that some people wanted to kill him and that he had had to go into hiding. Further, she told the victim that her husband had asked her to take here to where he was hiding. Upon receiving such information, the victim packed her bags and took 30,000 Kenyan shillings for the intended trip to be reunited with her husband.According to the victim, the appellant sent a taxi to collect her from her house, which took her and her children to the appellant’s house. The appellant told the victim that she was taking her to where her husband was hiding. The appellant then left the victim and her children in a vehicle together with two other men and women who were supposed to take them to her husband. However, the victim was blind folded, threatened with death and taken to a strange house. The victim slept in that house and when she enquired about her husband, she was told that he had escaped into Tanzania. The victim then crossed into Tanzania together with the 2 men and the 2 women. Upon arrival in Tanzania, she was taken to a strange house and left there alone with her child. The men who had taken her there left, and the 1st defendant, Babu Otom, forced her to have sex with several men. The complainant tried to escape on one occasion, but before she could reach a telephone booth to make a call, she was forced back into the house by a woman who was nearby. After her attempt, she was taken to Mwanza in Tanzania, where she was made to stay for a month. During her stay in Mwanza, she fell sick and sought treatment from a woman herbalist who offered to assist her escape. The woman helped her get in touch with her husband who was in Kenya and gave her money to travel back to Kenya sometime in January 2009.",trafficking in persons,1
"In the judgment, the Court reviewed nine cases to clarify the issue of duplication of convictions under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 29 of 2004 (POCA). In each of those cases, people had been convicted and sentenced for offences having the nature of theft (predicate offence), except for one where the predicate offence was receiving stolen property, and for contravening either section 4 (disguising unlawful origin of property) or section 6 (acquisition, possession or use of proceeds of unlawful activities) of POCA.The first case (S v Amos Henock, HC Ref. No 630/2019), involving one defendant named Amos Henock, concerned housebreaking with intent to steal and theft of a mobile phone. The defendant sold the phone to a friend for NAD 1,000.The second case (S v Hermanus Kandjoze & Albertus Kandjoze, HC Ref. No 935/2019), involving two defendants named Hermanus Kandjoze and Albertus Kandjoze, concerned the theft of goods which the defendants sold. The proceeds were used to purchase food.The third case (S v Nobel Aoagub, HC Ref. No 1016/2019), involving one defendant named Nobel Aoagub, concerned the theft of a mobile phone which the defendant sold for NAD 230.The fourth case (S v Alex Katjangua, Paul Abraham and Albertus Goeieman, HC Ref.No 1095/2019), involving three defendants named Alex Katjangua, Paul Abraham, and Albertus Goeieman, concerned the theft of nine sheep from the complainant’s farm. One of the stolen sheep was bartered to a passerby to obtain transportation.The fifith case (S v Albertus Ortman, HC Ref. No 1134/2019), involving one defendant named Albertus Ortman, concerned the theft of one sheep. The defendant slaughtered the sheep, kept one half for himself and gave the other half to two other men for sale for NAD 400. The defendant never received the proceeds from the sale.The sixth case (S v Kaarina Petrus, HC Ref. No 653/2019), involving one defendant named Kaarina Petrus, concerned the theft of case in the amount of NAD 50,679.35. The defendant used NAD 45,000 of the stolen money to settle personal debts, with the remainder spent on herself.The seventh case (S v Dawid Musongo & Stanley May, HC Ref. No 1560/2019), involving two defendants named Dawid Musongo and Stanley May, concerned housebreaking and theft of goods with a value of NAD 6,529. The goods were sold and the proceeds used to purchase food and drinks.The eigth case (S v Jonas Petrus, HC Ref. No: 1558/2019), involving one defendant named Jonas Petrus, concerned the theft of cash in the amount of NAD 4,739. The defendant gave some of the money to his girlfriend and kept the remainder for personal use.The ninth case (S v Jaco Sass, HC Ref. No: 587/2019), involving one defendant named Jaco Sass, concerned housebreaking and theft of goods valued at NAD 9,100. The goods were later sold.At the appeal stage, the High Court of Namibia Main Division looked at the definition of ‘serious crime’ as intended in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) to conclude that the severity of punishment according to the POCA implies the Namibian legislature had the intention of criminalizing the offence of money-laundering for serious predicate offences, as opposed to any type, or minor, offence. However, in the absence of legislation establishing which predicate offences are serious, prosecution under POCA lies within the discretion of the Prosecutor-General. This discretion must be exercised judiciously, guided by POCA provisions, and binding international agreements.The judgment further clarified the application of POCA and held that the author of the predicate offence could equally commit money-laundering when he/she committed any further act in connection with property being the proceeds of unlawful activities. On the other hand, section 6 only applied to a person other than the author of the predicate offence. Also, since the elements of the offence created under section 6 were similar to the elements of theft, the Court held that convicting for both theft and the contravention of section 6 would amount to a duplication of convictions.As a result, some of the convictions the Court considered were set aside while others were upheld.",money laundry,1
"This case is an appeal against a prior conviction of the appellant and two co-accused. The two-accused are not part of this appeal.On 10 August 2019 in the town of Outjo, the accused broke into private property and stole 33 rhino horns valued at NAD 4.9 million. They were charged with housebreaking and for illegal possession and dealing in wildlife products in contravention of the Controlled Wildlife Products Act 9 of 2008 and the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 29. During the trial, it became apparent that the accused faces similar charges in the town of Omungwelume.The investigating officer of the Namibian Police’s Protected Resources Division accused the appellant of being part of an organized criminal group that had specialized on dealing in rhino horn. Based on the officer’s investigation, which spanned several towns in Namibia and Angola, the syndicate specialized on illegally obtaining and rhino horns and selling them internationally. The investigator laid out that the syndicate has a multi-level hierarchy and that the accused links the lower to the higher level.On 15 May 2020, the accused were found guilty. The appellant challenged the fact that his request for bail had been rejected but saw his appeal dismissed.",money laundry,1
"The accused’s former wife (Stephanie), whilst employed by the complainant company, fraudulently syphoned large sums of money away from the company’s bank account and deposited the proceeds into the accused’s savings account. Despite the accused having disputed knowing that these funds were the proceeds of unlawful activity conducted by his former wife, the court at the end of the trial convicted him on the basis that the accused worked hand in hand with his former wife. Once the funds were deposited into his account, he effected the transfer of funds into various other accounts to the financial benefit of both.During the period extending from December 2009 up to July 2012 Stephanie was employed by Ferrodrill as the Office Administrator and as such responsible for the uploading of payments of the company creditors onto the Bank Windhoek payment system. Once authorised by the Managing Director,  payments would automatically be released (by the system), summarily crediting the creditor’s account. The banking details of the creditors were already uploaded onto the system but could be changed unilaterally and without authorisation by Stephanie. This enabled her to change the banking details of two creditor accounts, Omina Supplies and Navachab Mine (Navachab), effecting payments into the saving accounts of her daughter and the accused instead.Upon receipt of invoices from these two creditors, Stephanie reproduced same but inflated the amounts. The total sum of N$17 617 781.44 was diverted to the two savings accounts in this way. Subsequent thereto electronic transfers of funds (EFT’s) were made to the creditors, settling the actual amount reflected in the invoice submitted to Ferrodrill for payment. Though the actual prejudice suffered by Ferrodrill amounts to N$4 253 013.50, the accused was charged with the lesser sum of N$4 038 691.90, excluding the amounts reflected in counts 1 and 2 which were withdrawn. The accused admits that he and Stephanie expended the money that remained in the account.The accused was married to Stephanie but she had left the common home in March 2011; they divorced in November of the same year. Despite the breakup, funds continued being paid into the accused’s savings account from where electronic transfers were made to the creditors. This continued until Stephanie’s arrest on the 23rd of July 2012.At the time of their arrest the accused’s independent income was minimal and irregular, deriving from him acting as a ‘transport broker’ against payment of a brokerage fee. According to Stephanie this was merely a front as they were actually living off her salary and the money syphoned from Ferrodrill. She said the morning after her arrest she made a detailed statement to the police and, from the outset, admitted that she and the accused were both involved. Her implicating the accused is therefore not an afterthought, but shows consistency in her version.The accused was convicted on 32 counts of Theft totalling N$4 038 691.90 and, in respect of the money stolen, on one count of Money-Laundering in contravention of section 4 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 29 of 2004 (POCA).",money laundry,1
"On 16 June 2014, the First National Bank of Namibia (“FNB”) received an instruction from a corresponding German Bank to, on behalf of its Chinese corresponding Bank, pay an amount equivalent to EUR 192,518.60 into an account held in the name of Moses Pasana Uanjanda Kamunguma (the defendant).On receipt of the instructions, FNB requested the defendant to fill out a declaration form which required him to declare the reasons for the receipt of the funds. The defendant completed the declaration form and, within the form, indicated that the funds were from China North Industries Corporation in respect of ‘construction’.On 18 June 2014, FNB deposited an NAD 2,788,054.37 into the defendant’s cheque account held at FNB under the reference ‘commission’. Between 18 June 2014 and 18 March 2015 NAD 2,730,000 was transferred between the defendant’s cheque account and his 32 days investment account. Large amounts of cash were also withdrawn from those accounts during this period of time.The large number and size of these transactions and withdrawals were soon brought to the attention of the Anti-Corruption Commission (“ACC”). Subsequent investigations conducted by the ACC revealed that on 24 November 2014 and 16 December 2014, the defendant, through a series of transactions and withdrawals, used the funds from the two accounts to purchase a motor vehicle and pay off a motor vehicle financing loan at Nedbank.It was also revealed that on 23 February 2015, the defendant transferred an amount of NAD 2,000,000 from the cheque account to an investment account held at First National Bank of Namibia in his name.Based on the investigations of the ACC, the Prosecutor-General formed the view that the two motor vehicles as well as the funds held in the investment account of the defendant were proceeds of unlawful activities.",money laundry,0

"The accused hatched a plan to defraud his employer though a manipulation of the requests and payment system. The accused was further charged with the contravention of section 6 (a) (b) and (c) as read with section 11 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 29 of 2004 as amended.The accused defrauded his employer by transferring the money into third party’s account and later re-transferring same into his personal account, thereby disguising or concealing their source, movement and ownership, whereafter using the proceeds to purchase a motor vehicle for himself, making himself guilty of Money Laundering.Sentence: The accused was convicted on 147 counts of fraud and one count of money laundering.

"The respondent (ONESMUS NGHITUMU TAAPOPI) had enquired about possible procurement opportunities to provide accommodation services to the Namibian Defence Force (the NDF), indicating that he had a guest house, believed to be called Ace’s Guest House.Having been invited to provide the accommodation services, he submitted a quote in the amount of N$2 652 810, which was accepted. In August 2014, he submitted an invoice for a 40% upfront payment which was not immediately paid as the quote apparently got lost.To facilitate the payment process, the respondent was requested to submit his identity document (the ID), a letter from the bank confirming his account number and a letter confirming his ownership of the CC. The respondent submitted the founding papers of the CC. Later, on inquiry, the Ministry of Trade and Industry confirmed that the CC was instead registered in the name of the respondent's mother, Mrs Eunike Hamutenya. Nevertheless, the payment had already been made into his Standard Bank account by then.On 18 September 2014, an electronic payment in the amount of N$1 061 124 had been made from the Government of Namibia State account for the Ministry of Defence into a Standard Bank account held in the name of Sydney Hassan & Sons Trading CC (the Standard Bank account).On 19 September 2014, a cheque for N$800 000 with reference 'salary', was electronically transferred into a First National Bank account held in the name of Tulinane PS Hiskia, who turned out to be the respondent’s minor son.On that same day of 19 September 2014, a cheque for N$250 000 was cashedon the Standard Bank account of the CC, with a positive balance of only N$1491,15 remaining. The NDF later confirmed that the payment into the Standard Bank account of the CC, as stated above, had been made representing 40% of the amount of N$2 652 810 quoted for the provision of accommodation services requested by the NDF.On request by the director of the Ministry of Finance for details of the quotation, an enquiry at Ace’s Guest House revealed that the respondent did not own the guesthouse. It was in fact owned by Mr Rodgers Kiyonga Ddungu, who lives permanently in the United States of America. The latter was the owner of Lindrie Properties CC, which traded as Ace’s Guest House. The respondent was a regular client of the guest house and often brought clients.Concerning the money laundering allegations against the respondent, following the fraudulent acquisition of the tender, an amount of N$1 061 124 was deposited by the NDF into the CC’s Standard Bank account on 18 September 2014. By 23 September 2014,the balance on this account had swiftly reduced to N$1 591,15: a day after the NDF amount was deposited into the CC’s account, there was a cash withdrawal of N$5000, a cheque cashed in the amount of N$250 000 and N$800 000 was transferred into the respondent’s minor son’s FNB account with the unlikely reference as 'salary'. There was generally no credible justification forthcoming for this substantial amount deposited into his minor son’s personal bank account. Nor was there reasonable explanation for that amount of money itemised as 'salary'.The Supreme Court was of the view that reasonable grounds had been shown for the belief that the property, being the positive balance in the First National Bank, account of the respondent’s minor son, had constituted the proceeds of unlawful activities, in particular, fraud and money laundering.The test in s 51(2) had therefore been met and once this is the case, it is peremptory that an order for the preservation of property be granted.ConclusionReasonable grounds have been shown for the belief that the property, being the positive balance in the FNB account of the respondent’s minor son, had constituted the proceeds of unlawful activities, in particular, fraud and money laundering.The test in s 51(2) has therefore been met. In that case, the rule nisi issued by High Court on 10 October 2014 is confirmed and the application for the preservation of property order is granted; the appeal against the order of the High Court is upheld.

"In the proceeding, the defendant, a 40-year-old male, is accused of having raped and received two children, DA and MM, 13 and 14 years old respectively, and a 18-year-old girl, AK, to his house in order to exploit them sexually. The children, both of them young girls, were transferred there by another person (Ms Lukas, a 19-year-old woman) by means of taxi. Ms Lukas, who was transferring the children to the defendant’s place, was paid by the defendant for her services in accordance with their agreement, i.e., that she would get paid if she procured young girls for him. The defendant paid for the children’s transport to his place, as well as for the sexual intercourse he had with them. The sexual exploitation was taking place in the bedroom of the defendant and the victims left his house shortly after the intercourse. Specifically, regarding the first child, DA, she was taken to the defendant’s house by Ms Lukas on two occasions and subsequently, she went there on three occasions on her own. As regards to the second child, MM, she had only had one sexual encounter with the defendant and did not return there after.",trafficking in persons,0
"The defendant was charged with 3 counts of Trafficking in Persons and 5 counts of Rape. It was alleged that the defendant recruited the victim by means of coercion, deception, abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability with the intent to sexually exploit her. It was also alleged that the defendant coerced the victim to commit sexual acts with various men. In May 2012, the defendant approached the victim at Okahenge village and told the victim that she should leave school because the defendant got a job for her in Okahandja. The victim is an orphan, but her mother was the half-sister of the defendant’s mother. The victim believed the defendant and agreed to travel Okahandja. The defendant gave the victim N$200 for travel expenses which was to be repaid once the victim starts working. When the victim arrived at the Okahandja service station, the defendant fetched her and brought her to the farm where the defendant was staying and where the victim was supposed to work. The defendant then told the victim that there was no job for her, but a man called Johnny paid for her travel and she must live with him. The defendant threatened the victim that if she does not stay with Johnny, she must find another place to stay. The defendant also threatened and forced the victim to have sex with Johnny. The victim stayed with Johnny for two and a half months during which he had sexual intercourse with the victim nightly. Within that period, Johnny gave the defendant 10kg of sugar and meat. After a misunderstanding between Johnny and the victim, the defendant told the victim to leave Johnny. The victim stayed with the defendant who promised to find her a job. After one month, the defendant told the victim to stay with another man, Phillip, who gave the defendant carrots and meat. Phillip attempted to have sexual intercourse with the victim, but the victim ran back to the defendant’s place. A few days later, the defendant threw the victim out of her place and forced her to stay in the place of another man named Nico. Nico told the victim that she was now his wife  but he will not give her money because he is giving it to the defendant. Nico had sexual intercourse with the victim several times.",trafficking in persons,1
"The defendant was charged with child trafficking and rape under coercive circumstances of 5 minor girls. The defendant and the victims come from poor backgrounds and lived in the same informal settlement neighbourhood. The victims visited the defendant regularly to share in the food he had, which was a common practice in the community. The defendant occasionally sent the victims on errands to buy for him cigarettes in return for small cash-gifts. The mothers of the victims were on good personal terms with the defendant and knew about the errand-gift arrangement. From the collective version of the victims, in November 2015, the defendant started to lock the victims in his room upon their return from the errand of buying cigarettes. The defendant would then undress the girls after threatening them, apply baby oil on his male genitalia and attempt to insert it in the victims’ genitalia. It was further alleged that the defendant would lick the victims’ genitalia. He threatened to kill them if they told anyone about what happened. He would also give them food items after the sexual act. The Court found that the investigation was poorly conducted as no serious attempt was made after the allegations surfaced to try and garner additional evidence that would add greater weight to the victims’ allegations.",trafficking in persons,1
"Between 23 April and May 2012, in the district of Swakopmund, the accused Johanna Lukas recruited the complainants D and M, two minor girls, by means of coercion, abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability with the intent that Martinus Pretorius, an adult male, subjects the said girls to sexual exploitation. The accused also caused Pretorius to commit or to continue to commit a sexual act with both complainants.Evidence on behalf of the StateTestimony of the gynecologistDr Badi Watunda, a General Practitioner who also practices as a gynecologist, testified that he examined D and M when the police brought them to him. In both respects, the doctor could not say when exactly the hymen was broken.

He further testified that D recounted to him that she had been taken by the accused to a white man who had sex with her in April 2012 and further that on the first occasion she got food stuff and on another occasion she was given an amount of N$1 000.Testimony of the accused friendShe testified, to the greatest detriment of the accused, that during her visit to the holding cells the accused told her that: 'Felicity and [I] used to take girls to this white man'. The very accusation which the State makes against the accused and which she vehemently denies.Statements of complainant DD testified that the accused took her to the house of the white man with the taxi, left D at the said house and the white man sent D to the bedroom where he committed a sexual act with her. The white man has been identified as Martinus Pretorius. According to D, after Pretorius finished committing the sexual act with her, he called the accused and asked the accused why she had lied to him that the complainant was a virgin. Pretorius asked the accused how much money he should give to the complainant.The complainant testified in much detail and was adamant that the accused took her to Pretorius in order for Pretorius to commit sexual acts with her.In respect of her subsequent visits to the house of Pretorius, D testified that the accused took her, on the second occasion, to Pretorius’s house with a taxi. When they got there, Pretorius told the complainant to proceed to the room and undress herself. This demand was allegedly made in the presence of the accused who was standing next to Pretorius. Pretorius then proceeded to have sexual intercourse with D. D testified that the accused was in the sitting room while Pretorius was having sexual intercourse with her in the bedroom. After Pretorius finished having sexual intercourse with her, the accused sent a text message to the taxi driver to come and pick them up. According to D, at the time that the accused sent the text message to the taxi driver, she, the accused and Pretorius were sitting together in the sitting room. D testified and confirmed that on this second occasion, Pretorius gave her N $500 while the accused was given N$100.Regarding the third time that the accused allegedly took her to the house of Pretorius, D testified that it was still during the month of May 2012. The accused sent her a text message inviting her to sleep with Pretorius and that Pretorius would give her N$500. Once again, D went to the house of the accused who thereafter took her to the house of Pretorius. After the sexual intercourse, Pretorius paid D N$500 where after D left with the accused in a taxi.The complainant also gave evidence relating to the fourth time that the accused allegedly took her to Pretorius. On this occasion, D was given N$1000 from which she gave the accused N$ 100. The accused then left with D in a taxi.The complainant D further testified that the accused told her that she had a 26-year-old friend, called Frans, who was looking for a young girl of her age. The accused asked D to find a girl of her age for Frans. It is on this basis that D approached M and later took her to the accused’s house. D testified that she was not present when the accused took M to Pretorius.Statements of complainant MM testified that it was D who first took her to the house of the accused during a school break. She testified that she was 14 years old at the time. Her mother who also testified, confirmed her age. D told her that the accused was a friend and that the accused has white male friends who have sex with small kids in return for N$ 1000. The following day, while M was on her way to the orphan’s house, she met the accused who told her that D was at her home and waiting for her. To M’s surprise, D was not at the accused’s home when she got there. The accused thereafter received an SMS and told M that it was from the white man. The accused and M left, without D, to the white man’s house.On the way to meet the white man, M testified that the accused told her that the white man’s name was John, was 26 years of age, and only has sex with small kids in return for N $ 1000. The accused allegedly told her to tell this man that she was a virgin. At the house, they found a big white man smoking outside. The evidence of the witness made it clear that this white man was Pretorius about whom D testified.The tenor of M’s evidence is that when she arrived at Pretorius’s house, she found a much older and bigger man, being Pretorius, than what was promised her by the accused. Pretorius told her to go into the bedroom, which she did, and was then told by him to undress. She refused and upon Pretorius addressing her in a harsh tone, which frightened her, she removed her clothes and was sexually assaulted by Pretorius. She felt pain and pushed him off her. Pretorius then gave her N$ 200 whereupon she and the accused left in a taxi.M testified that at the beginning she lied and told her parents and the superiors at the hostel that she had gone to Walvis Bay with friends. But later told her parents that she went to Vineta to have sex with an elderly man.Statements of HWitness H testified that she and the accused are cousins and that the accused person was like a mother and friend to her. H testified that the accused person looked after her and cared for her and never did anything to harm her. H denied that the accused enticed her to commit a sexual, indecent or immoral act with Pretorius. H testified that the accused person never took her to the house of a white man to have sex with him.Statements of the accusedThe accused testified that she is currently 22 years of age and that she was staying with her mother, her father and siblings. She was employed at Woermann Brock, Swakopmund, prior to her arrest and detention. The accused testified that she knew Martin Pretorius through a friend, Felicity. Pretorius informed her that he intended establishing a welfare organization to assist under privileged children from the DRC informal settlement. Pretorius accordingly enquired from her whether she knew children who might benefit from such a welfare organization. The accused testified that she went to the house of Pretorius with D, whose number she obtained through text massage from a friend. She then went to Pretorius’ house because Pretorius requested her to come to his house in order to go through the paper work concerning the welfare organization.The accused testified that in April D visited her house. The accused explained the purpose of the intended organization to D where after D then agreed to go with her to the house of Pretorius. That was the day when she met D for the first time. The accused testified that, on Pretorius’ invitation, she and D went to Pretorius’ house by taxi.Pretorius thereafter asked the accused and D if they were hungry.

"All of the victims and some other Myanmar citizens wanted to work in Thailand. They – therefore – contacted a Myanmar middleman, who helped them enter Thailand illegally. In return, each victim had to pay the middleman between 8,500 and 12,000 Baht. The victims were told that they would be working in a food or fruit processing factory.

T. to Thailand.In order to get in to Thailand, they had to travel by car, boats as well as on foot. Along the way to the border, the middlemen collected some other Myanmar citizens, who also wanted to go to Thailand for finding a job. Once they arrived at the border, they entered Thailand illegally on foot in Mae Sod District, Tak Province. The 6th and 7th victim travelled together with other 40 Myanmar citizens by several pickup trucks to Bangkok, where they spent a night before they left for a dock in Cholburi Province in the next morning.

In the middle of July 2005, the defendant convinced all three victims to work in Italy, promising that the 1st and 2nd victims were going to work as chefs and that the 3rd one would work as an assistant at the defendant’s grocery store. The defendants paid for the victims’ travel expenses in advance. The victims trusted the defendants as they were from the same village. They knew each other from when they were children and they were also distant relatives. Once in Italy, the victims were taken to a small room in an apartment used as a brothel. The victims stayed in the same room as the defendants’ employees and were restricted from leaving the room, as the door was code-locked and guarded at all times. The defendants forced the victims to become prostitutes, threatening that if they did not accept, they would not receive any food and would be gang-raped. The 1st victim got pregnant after 22 days in Italy and was forced to have an abortion and work again after two days. The expenses of the abortion were added to her debt. The victims were arrested on 6 June 2006 because their visas expired. The three victims were sent back to Thailand with twenty or more Thai nationals, with the financial assistance of the IOM Foundation.",other crimes,0
"In this case, 121 labour migrants were smuggled from Myanmar to Thailand. On 9 April 2008, the 121 migrants from Myanmar boarded the rear refrigeration compartment intending to reach Phuket and take up employment.Though the driver's associates called him repeatedly during the early portion of the journey to remind him to check that the storage compartment's air conditioning was functioning properly, he stopped answering his phone when he encountered an extended period of treacherous winding roads. During this time, the migrants in the rear of the truck also tried to contact the driver by phone. Though it is unclear whether the driver failed to turn the refrigeration unit on, or whether the unit subsequently failed, the migrants were rapidly running out of breathable air. Eventually, the driver pulled his truck to the side of the road in response to noises coming from the storage compartment, discovered that many of his passengers appeared near death, and fled. When police arrived, they found that 54 of the 121 passengers had suffocated. Among the survivors, the police discovered 14 children, 7 adult workers with proper documentation, and 46 workers without proper documentation. At least eight people, all of them Thai nationals, were later charged in relation to this incident.Details about the charges and outcomes were not readily available at the time of writing.",other crimes,0
"The Defendant worked in 1993 as a medical doctor at the Police General Hospital in Bangkok. The Defendant owned several farms in Petchburi Province. The three victims – all illegal alien workers - worked for the defendant on his farm. They knew that the Defendant owned lots of guns and had often practices shooting on paper targets on his farms.The three victims were nationals of Myanmar and entered into Thailand illegally.   The 1st victim worked on the Defendant’s farm where he first met the 2nd victim; they became husband and wife and had children together.The 1st victim: In 2001, the 1st victim lived and worked on one of the Defendant’s farms in Petchburi Province and had a fight with Mr. Pu, by which Mr. Pu was stabbed to death. The 1st victim was, therefore, sentenced to three years of imprisonment. After his release from prison, the Defendant brought him back to the farm. The 1st victim once escaped from the farm to Prachuap Kiri Khan Province, where he worked for Mr. Noi. After one year of working for Mr. Noi, the 1st victim found out that the 2nd victim still worked on the Defendant’s farm. He asked Mr. Noi for help and they successfully helped her and her first daughter escape from the Defendant’s farm.  Approximately one year after helping the 2nd victim escape from the farm, the 1st victim was accused of stealing the Defendant’s guns; police officers came to Mr. Noi’s farm to arrest the 1st victim. However, police officers could not find supporting evidence for the charge and had to release him from their custody. Since the 1st victim had severe stomach pain by the time of his release from police custody, he was admitted in the hospital, where he spent a month for medical treatment.  As he recovered from the pain and was released from the hospital,  Mr. Suthep – the Defendant’s brother – picked him up from the hospital and brought him to the Defendant’s clinic. On the next morning, the Defendant brought the 1st victim to the farm where he met the 2nd victims and other five workers nationals of Myanmar. They had to sleep sometimes in the garage, sometimes in the barns. There were also no proper sanitary facilities available.In 2011, the 2nd victim gave birth to her 2nd child which the 1st victim delivered himself.  Three days after giving birth to her child, the 2nd victim had to get back to work and harvest corn on the farm and wash cars. Not long after that the 1st victim accidentally fell from a wood cutting vehicle and broke his left arm and suffered an injury on the spine. The Defendant took him to his clinic and he spent 2 weeks in the Police General Hospital. After his stay in the hospital, the 1st victim was brought back to the farm in the condition that he was unable to walk. He could only roll or move forward in sitting position. Regardless of his physical condition, he would meet the 2nd victim only upon the permission of the Defendant or Ms. Wilasa’s (the defendant’s wife). After spending 6 months in this condition, the Defendant then allowed the 2nd victim to stay with the 1st victim on the farm.On 25 February 2012, the hand of the 1st victim was accidentally cut by the corn shredder. He was brought to the defendant’s clinic for a medical treatment. After 2 or 3 days of staying there, he was brought back to the farm where he stayed for a while until the police came to search the farm and rescued him.The 2nd Victim: Ten years ago, the Defendant brought the 2nd victim to his clinic where she had to do the laundry and all the house works for the Defendant. Sometimes, she also had to work with the 1st victim on the farm. She worked for the Defendant altogether for 12 years.As her 1st daughter was one year and two months old, the 1st victim and Mr. Noi helped her and her daughter escape from the farm to Hua Hin District, Prachuap Kiri Khan Province. She stayed with Mr. Noi until her daughter turned three years old. As the 1st victim was arrested on the farm, the Defendant brought her and her daughter back to the farm. They stayed there for about four months until the 1st victim was brought back to the farm.The 3rd victim: In April 2011, the 3rd victim was brought from Tak Province to the farm by van. On the way to the farm, he had to hide under the seat. The Defendant told the 3rd victim that he had to work for one year and a half and he would receive 6,000 Baht (app. 175 USD) per month. As he was working on the farm, all other alien workers escaped from the farm. So that besides him, there were only the 1st victim and the 2nd victim left working on the farm.He worked on the farm, until he was rescued by the police.All the victims and their family are now under the victim protection programme.",trafficking in persons,1
"In September 2012, Police Captain P. was informed that several Lao women were engaging in prostitution at “Lucky Karaoke Bar” in Bangkok. Through surveillance, he confirmed the presence of several women who routinely left the bar accompanied by males. The women and the male customers would then walked to the rental rooms at the end of the street and enter the rooms together. After a while, the women would return to the bar.Upon this information, Police Captain P. set up an undercover operation. Police Captain P., Sub-Lieutenant W. and Senior Sergeant T. entered the bar and pretended to be regular guests. At the bar, two women came to the table of the undercover police officers and offered to provide them with sexual services. The officers were told that if they were interested in any of the women who were working at the bar, they would have to pay 1,120 Baht to the bar manager in order to “spend time” with one of the women. The officers agreed to the offer. They left the bar together with the women, and a boy took them to the rented rooms at the end of the street with his motorcycle. The woman gave the boy 20 Baht for a condom.Once inside the room – and while the woman was in the shower - Police Captain P. took a look around and found some used condoms in the trash can. Police Captain P. chatted with the woman and told her that he would be interested in having sex with a child. The women told him, hereupon, that there were several children (under 15 and under 18 years of age) working at the bar. After 30 minutes, the women called the man with the motorcycle to come and pick them up and bring them back to the bar, without engaging in any sexual activities.On October 3, 2012, Captain P., Sub-Lieutenant W. and Senior Sergeant T., along with their colleagues planed an undercover operation. As part of this operation, Police Senior Sergeant T. took a number of specially marked 1000-Baht-banknotes, 100-Baht-banknotes as well as 20-Baht-banknotes with him and went into the bar. The officers had previously made photocopies of all these banknotes, before conducting the operation.Police Captain P., Sub-Lieutenant W. and Senior Sergeant T. entered the bar posing as regular guests. A woman approached them and asked whether they were interested in any of the girls/women in the bar. The officers agreed to the offer and asked for underage girls. The three officers left the bar with the 3rd victim and two other women. A man with a motorcycle brought all of them to the rented rooms. While the 3rd victim and the women were taking a shower, the officers called their colleagues for back up. On the way to the rental rooms, Police Captain R. and other officers saw a man riding a motorcycle from the rental room to the bar. They asked him to stop and identify himself. The man did not have a passport, but he was later identified as a Lao citizen. He admitted to the officers that he worked at “Lucky Karaoke Bar”. The police officers conducted a strip search and found the marked 20-Baht-banknotes in his pocket; he was, therefore, brought under police custody.The police officers searched the rooms, finding used condoms in trash cans as well as the marked 1,000-Baht-banknotes, which were found in the purses of the 3rd victim and the two other women. The officers interviewed the minor victim and the two women. The interview revealed that they were Lao citizens. After the interview, they were also brought under police custody.During the search conducted at the bar, the officers arrested the 1st defendant, who was a waitress, and the 2nd defendant, who was a relative of the bar owner, and took statements from the 16 Lao citizens found working at the bar. The officers found a notebook in which the 1st defendant wrote down a “+” sign after each of the women’s names. The 3rd victim later testified that the “+” sign meant how many times the girls/women had engaged in sexual activities with their customers. The officers also found 39 condoms. The Lao citizens admitted that they all worked at the restaurant, despite not having the required work permits.During the identification process, three underage victims were identified. The other 13 women were not identified as victims because they were over 18 years of age, and there was no evidence of the presence of any of the means required for the commission of the crime of human trafficking.The three victims in this case testified later in court and stated that Mr. P.O. was the bar owner, that the two defendants took care of the bar and the girls/women working at the bar also worked as prostitutes.",trafficking in persons,1
"All of the victims and some other Myanmar citizens wanted to work in Thailand. They – therefore – contacted a Myanmar middleman, who helped them enter Thailand illegally. In return, each victim had to pay the middleman between 8,500 and 12,000 Baht. The victims were told that they would be working in a food or fruit processing factory. In April 2012, the 1st, 2nd and the 3th victim travelled with Mr. M. T. and the 6th and the 7th victim travelled with Mr. J. T. to Thailand.In order to get in to Thailand, they had to travel by car, boats as well as on foot. Along the way to the border, the middlemen collected some other Myanmar citizens, who also wanted to go to Thailand for finding a job. Once they arrived at the border, they entered Thailand illegally on foot in Mae Sod District, Tak Province. The 6th and 7th victim travelled together with other 40 Myanmar citizens by several pickup trucks to Bangkok, where they spent a night before they left for a dock in Cholburi Province in the next morning. At the same time, the 1st and 2nd victim and other 71 Myanmar citizens travelled directly to a dock in Chonburi Province by several pickup trucks.At the Suvit-Jetty in Samaersan Subdistrict, Sattahip District in Chonburi Province, four of the victims (the 1st, 2nd, 6th and the 7th victim) first met the defendant – Mr. Uu Wen or Uu Win or Uu Wong – and were told by the defendant that each of them were sold at 12,500 Baht to him to work in fishing trawlers. In order to pay off this debt, the victims were forced to work in the vessels. Whenever they refused to work, they would be beaten up or they would be threatened to be killed.The 1st victim had to work in the fishing trawler number 56, which was controlled by skipper Tong Chui. The 2nd victim was sent to the trawler number 12, the 3rd and the 6th and the 7th victim to the trawler number 75, which is controlled by skipper Ga Dong. A fishing expedition took normally 15 – 20 days. During the trip, the victims had to do all the works needed to be done on the trawlers, i.e. spreading out the fishing net on the water, hauling them back in, sorting the catch, storing the fish in the boxes and covering them with ice. In case the victims became too ill to work or did not work fast enough, they would be beaten up or would be harmed with knives or with an electric shocker. All the victims were hence too frightened to escape.After docking in the port, all nine victims had to sleep in the trawlers, where they were strictly controlled by the defendant or trawler’s skippers. Some of the victims were allowed to sleep in a wood row house near the trawlers, which was under strict control of the defendant and his accomplices.As the trawler number 12 and 56 docked in June 2012, the 1st and 2nd victim secretly informed Mr. K. T. – the elder brother of the 1st victim and also a relative of the 2nd victim – and asked him for help. Mr. K. T. informed the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) and the “Labor Right Promotion Network Foundation” of the situation of his younger brother and his relative. By prior arrangement with the police, Mr. K. T. negotiated with Mr. Tong Chui and paid 15,000 Baht for the release of the 1st victim.Later in June 14, 2012, the 2nd victim successfully contacted and asked Mr. K. T. again for help. By prior arrangement with police officer and according to the prior negotiation between Mr. K. T. and the defendant, 15,000 Baht was handed over to the defendant for the release of the 2nd victim. The police could successfully take evidence photographs of the persons involved during the negotiation and the money handover.After the release of the 2nd victim, the police and officers from DSI (Department of Special Investigation) planned a rescue operation of trafficking victims. On July 26, 2012 the officers got a search and arrest warrant from the court. By this operation the 3th victim and another 11 trafficked victims – including the 4th – 9th victim – were successfully rescued. The defendant was arrested, electric shocking devices were seized.The 1st, 2nd, 6th and the 7th victim testified in court and informed the court of their situation on the trawlers. The content of their testimonies in court corresponded to the statement of the rest of the victims given to investigating officers and the statements of those given through an interpreter.",trafficking in persons,1
"The two defendants and another six, still fleeing, accomplices operated a brothel under the disguise of a karaoke bar, where minors under 15 years of age and minors between 15 – 18 years of age were forced into prostitution.Between April 2011 and October 2011, these victims were lured away from their parents in Laos, as they were told that there were jobs available at a restaurant in Thailand. The Lao trafficker then took the minors to the immigration authority in Laos to apply for passports by using the falsified personal data concerning the age that they were over 18 years old. Right after their arrival in Thailand, they were brought to the karaoke bar cum brothel run by the two defendants in Su Ngai Kolok District, Naratiwat   Province, Thailand.During their stay in the karaoke bar, they were under strict control and their passports were taken away. All the victims were told that they owed the defendants and their accomplices 40,000 Baht each (app. USD 1,340). In order to pay off this debt, the victims were forced to work as prostitutes in this karaoke bar.One of the victims secretly informed her mother of her situation using a mobile phone of one of her clients and asked her mother to seek help in rescuing her and her friends. Her mother passed on this information to law enforcement officers. On 14 December 2011, law enforcement officers from the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) and staff of Women Foundation of Thailand raided the brothel and successfully rescued 40 Lao women from karaoke bar. However, only 20 of them were identified as trafficking victims and received assistance at the Srisurat Shelter House for trafficking victims of the MSDHS (Ministry of Social Development and Human Security).The youngest victim rescued from the karaoke bar was 12 years of age and the oldest was 20 years of age.",trafficking in persons,1
"The 1st defendant, a Chinese national with a temporary permit to stay in Thailand, was the manager of the company known as “Baby 101 Company”, which was not registered.The 2nd, 3rd and 4th defendants (all Chinese nationals) were allowed to stay in the Kingdom of Thailand temporarily, but did not have a work permit. Nevertheless, they worked for the aforementioned “Baby 101 Company” without a work permit.The company was owned by Mr. S.L.L. or L.P. (also a Chinese national). The sole purpose of the company was to find surrogate mothers for the company’s customers.In June B.E. 2553, Mr. S.L.L., together with the five defendants in the current case, and their accomplices – Chinese  and Vietnamese nationals – enticed the four victims with promises of well-paid jobs in Thailand. They did not inform the victims of the nature of the job, and the victims agreed to this offer without knowing that they would have to act as surrogate mothers for the company’s clients. The defendants arranged a one-way-trip to Thailand for the four victims. After their arrival in Thailand, the defendants picked the victims up from the airport and brought them to a house in Thararom Village, Saphan Sung District, Bangkok. The victims were forced to stay in the house and their movements were strictly monitored by the defendants at all times.After staying in the house for a while, the 1st defendant and his accomplices told the four victims that they had been hired to become pregnant for the company’s customers. If they did not, they would have to pay 940 USD or 20 Millions Vietnamese Dong as a penalty, and to pay for the tickets to go back to Vietnam themselves. The four victims did not have any money, they were far away from home, unfamiliar with Thailand, and their passports had been taken away by the defendants. Therefore, they could not leave Bangkok and had to agree to the defendants’ demands. Furthermore, the 1st and 3rd victims were also raped by Mr. S.L.L.Once the victims agreed to become pregnant, they had to run through a medical examination in a hospital in Bangkok, where the fertilized eggs were be implanted in their uterus for the purpose of impregnating the women.The 1st, 3rd and 5th defendants would normally bring the Vietnamese women to the hospital for the medical check-ups themselves. Ms P.S.J. would be present during these visits, and act as a translator, translating any conversation from Chinese into Thai and vice versa, in order to ensure that the Vietnamese women never had direct contact with the doctors or anyone else at all. After the 1st and 3rd victims became pregnant, the 1st defendant and his accomplices forced them to sign a surrogacy contract. Fertilized eggs were also implanted in the uterus of the 2nd and the 4th victims, but they did not become pregnant. While they were waiting for the next implantation, the 4th victim found the telephone number of the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok in the internet. She called the Embassy and informed the Embassy personnel of her situation. The person answering the call  passed all of this information on to officers of the Department for Special Investigations, who, together with police officers, officers from the Immigrations Bureau, and other concerned officials, planned an intervention to remove the women from this situation.  In February B.E. 2554 (2011), police officers searched 2 houses in Thararom Village, Bangkok. In the first house, which served as the office of the “Baby 101 Company”, the police officers performing the search found Ms. P.S.J. together with the five defendants, a Chinese girl, a Vietnamese girl, and nine Vietnamese women – some of whom were pregnant. They all confessed that they were surrogate mothers. The police officers also found the passports of 13 Vietnamese women, surrogacy contracts, computers and other documents.In the 2nd house with, the police found a Myanmese woman and the four victims.",trafficking in persons,1
"The defendants - J.G., J.G. and T.G.- are brothers who decided to set up a business in 1999. They ran a night club, which in fact functioned as a brothel from the very beginning until 2005. The three brothers hired Polish and Ukrainian women practising prostitution, rented rooms to them and supplied them with indispensable household facilities in order to enable providing sexual services to clients. According to internal regulations operating in the night club, prostitutes were obliged to work every day between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. and they were punished financially in case of breaking some rules, such as smoking cigarettes in restricted areas or leaving the brothel without a consent of the defendants. Any profits derived from sexual services rendered to the clients of the escort agency were divided into equal parts between the employed women and the three brothers. The defendants worked in shifts, so each night they took turns in supervising the business. Financial settlements between brothers and prostitutes were made immediately after receiving money from clients or at the latest - the next day. Women handed in a certain sum of money personally to one of the defendants, who was currently on duty.Among the prostitutes hired in the night club there were also the two victims – O.S. and N.C. O.S. had already worked for several months in 2000 as a prostitute in Germany, from where she had been deported to Ukraine. The next year, in order to find a job, O.S. had travelled to Poland, where she had gotten hired by one of the escort agencies as a prostitute. During working in that place she had met two Ukrainian citizens, who had offered her to arrange a legal job in Germany. O.S. had not accepted the offer at that time and had gone back to Ukraine. In mid-2002 O.S. contacted the two Ukrainian men and asked them to organize the departure and find her a job in Germany. They agreed to help and assured her several times of their intention to arrange a legal entering and stay in Germany for her.  Before leaving Ukraine O.S. was informed about the costs including the transportation to Poland and organizing legitimate documents, which would enable her to cross the German border, and that she would be obliged to return. The total expenses were calculated to US$ 800. O.S. agreed to those terms.N.C. contacted the same Ukrainians through her friend seeking to have a job abroad arranged. She presumed that she would work as a prostitute in Poland. The two Ukrainian men and N.C. agreed that the expenses in a sum of US$ 700 (or 1000) including  organizing a passport and a journey would be worked off by N.C. after getting having started her job in Poland.In August 2002 O.S. and N.C. together with two Ukrainians crossed the Polish border and arrived at the night club run by the defendants. The next day brothers paid US$ 1000 to the Ukrainian men as the price for both girls. As soon as the transaction had been completed, the two Ukrainians left the escort agency. The entire price paid by J.G., J.G. and T.G. for O.S. and N.C. was later deducted from earnings provided by both prostitutes. Apart from handing in half of the income gained from clients, the two Ukrainian girls were obliged to make additional payments from their part of shares in order to return US$ 1000 paid by the owners of the night club to the Ukrainian men.O.S. and N.C. took up a job and continued to work as prostitutes in the escort agency voluntarily. However, it happened on a number of occasions for several times that O.S. was forced by the defendants to provide some sexual services, which she did not agree to. Several times she was compelled by physical force and threats to satisfy a client’s special sexual requests.In January 2003 O.S. provided sexual services to a client, from whom she stole a golden bracelet. The client discovered a lack of his piece of jewellery and accused O.S. of committing a theft. O.S. denied stealing the bracelet and as a result of that she was beaten up by the client. The defendants stood nearby but did not contribute to harming O.S. They actually tried to stop the client from further beating O.S. In consequence of suffered injuries, the defendants  immediately arranged transportation of O.S. to a hospital. After this incident O.S. moved to another escort agency and continued to work as a prostitute.One day in the first half of 2003 the two Ukrainian men who had “sold” O.S. and N.C. to J.G., J.G. and T.G. appeared in the defendants’ night club. They demanded that N.C. make additional monthly payments to them. When she denied, she was beaten by the Ukrainians. As a result of this incident, J.G., J.G. and T.G. deducted required sums of money from N.C. earnings and transferred them to the Ukrainians. In mid-2003 N.C. escaped from defendants’ night club and moved to another escort agency, where she continued to practise prostitution.The investigation in this case was launched as a result of the notification of crime submitted by O.S. in October 2006. Giving the grounds for the judgement, the District Court in Nowy Sącz did not establish a certain reason which would explain why O.S. decided to contact the police 3 years after the crime had been committed. The court indicated that O.S. possibly became afraid of the two Ukrainians, who had delivered her to the defendants’ night club. The other probable reason for the cooperation with public authorities stated by the court was that O.S. had made a decision to stop practising prostitution and change her unethical and immoral lifestyle. However, in order to accomplish her goals, she must have had legalised her stay in Poland. Those reasons, according to the court, determined her decision to cooperate with police and to join a governmental program concerning protection of victims affected by trafficking in persons. This factor was taken into account in an assessment of the gathered proofs. Testimony given by O.S. was especially subjected to detailed consideration by the court, which acknowledged only those portions of her statements to be true that could be confirmed by other pieces of evidence. Apart from that, the court minutely analyzed the whole gathered proofs such as: documents, experts’ opinions, victims’ and witnesses’ testimonies, defendants’ explanations.J.G., J.G. and T.G. were temporarily arrested during the investigation and trial. J.G. generally exercised the right to refuse to make a statement and pleaded not guilty. The other defendant - J.G.-  generally exercised the right to refuse to make a statement as well but he partly pleaded guilty of  facilitating the prostitution and deriving material benefits from the prostitution of women hired in the night club. T.G. generally exercised the right to refuse to make a statement too and pleaded not guilty. According to the court partial explanations made by each of the defendants were mainly inconsistent with other pieces of evidence gathered in this case.The materials concerning the two Ukrainian men who recruited and transported O.S. and N.C.  in order to engage them in prostitution were excluded from the analyzed case and have been subject to another investigation.",other crimes,1
"The victim was working as a prostitute in Kenya. The defendants, a married couple who run a guesthouse together, offered her a job in Poland. She was promised cleaning work and to work in a pub as a bartender and a dancer. After her arrival in Poland, the defendants abused her position of vulnerability and forced her into prostitution. Although she could keep her passport and was free to move, the court later decided that she was dependent on the defendants because she owed them money for the journey. The victim was not able to speak the language of the country. Profit made by defendants from the victim’s prostitution was estimated to amount to not less than PLN 23,940 (approximately USD 7,015).",other crimes,1
"From 2004 to 2005, M.M. was a victim of human trafficking. In October 2004, she met three men (M.G., Z.O., G.B.) who encouraged her to go with them to Sweden and work there as a prostitute. They guaranteed that she would be able to keep all the money earned for herself.M.M. worked as a prostitute in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Her money earned was always in the possession of the above mentioned men. Finally, all three men were arrested. M.M., after having testified as a victim of human trafficking, came back to Poland. Her testimony was incriminatory for M.G., Z.O. and G.B.In 2006, D.G., after serving his punishment, returned to Poland. He met with M.M. and assured her that he had changed. At the same time he encouraged her to return with him to Sweden or Norway. He also proposed that she should find other women who would like to work as  prostitutes. M.M. met with E.C. and offered her a trip to Sweden. M.M. guarantied her that she could keep all the money earned. E.C. was aware that she would work as a prostitute, but M.M. concealed from her how she had been treated in years 2004-2005, i.e. by D.G.In the fall of 2006, M.M. and E.C. left to Norway. Their trip was financed by D.G. E.C. immediately started to work as a prostitute. D.G. and M.M. kept all her money for drugs for both of them. The victim was held in a flat rented by D.G. She was only allowed to contact D.G., M.M. and her clients. She was browbeaten and subjected to physical and psychological violence. D.G. beat her twice. She often starved, but she never asked for food because of her fear of D.G. M.M. Both offenders permanently induced E.C. to prostitute.After some period of time, D.G. and M.M. left and “passed"" E.C. to a man called Husajn E.C. worked under his supervision. Finally, he allowed her to come back to Poland. At the same time, D.G. and M.M. left to Denmark where M.M. was prostituting to gain money for drugs for both of them. After some time, they both moved to Sweden where they met with G.B. (mentioned above). G.B. demanded that M.M. change the incriminating statements concerning facts form the years 2004-2005 as another criminal proceeding against him had already been in progress in Poland. M.M. claimed that she was beaten by G.B. and this, along with threats of killing her and her family, made her change her previous statements. M.M. went back to Poland and on 7 September 2007 she gave her testimony claiming that she didn’t know G.B. and in years 2004-2006 she had been prostituting of her own free will since she needed money to buy drugs only for herself. In comparison with other pieces of evidence, her statement was found untrue.",other crimes,1

The defendant proposed the victims to go to Żary, a village close to the German border (approximately 570 km from Jasło), in order to get a job in his cousin's bar. A.R assured them that there was a job for both of them. A.B. and S.S. accepted the offer.Upon arrival, it turned out that there was no vacancy. Instead, A.R. offered the victims a job in Germany as bartenders or waitresses and they accepted it. Although they had no passports, A.R. contacted two unknown men who appeared in the morning and transported the victims through the border river threatening them with a knife. After crossing the Polish-German border, a car took all of them to the city of Duisburg. The victims were informed that they would be working in the escort agency as prostitutes.In Duisburg, the victims were placed in the flat of a Polish couple (K.B. and R.B). Consequently, K.B. organised “display meetings” with owners of night clubs and escort agencies in Germany with the aim of selling A.B and S.S. A.R. visited the flat from time to time. Meanwhile S.S. was raped by R.B. After few days, A.B. was “sold” and taken by one of the escort agency boss who paid K.B.A.B. was forced to work at a night club as a prostitute. She did not receive any salary.  Finally, she contacted her friend from Poland, who took her away from Duisburg pretending to be one of the clients.S.S. was transferred to a brothel in Kaarst and worked involuntarily as a prostitute. After working in various escort agencies, she managed to escape. She still lives in Germany.A.R. knew people from human trafficking business and had extensive contacts in this area. He  transferred the victims to other people who were part of this proceeding.There was no relationship between the defendant and the victims. The victims were two young girls with basic education and low social status. A.B. and S.S. did not speak German. They were able to participate in court proceeding, but refused to confront defendants during the trial.",other crimes,0
"Two Polish men – Ł.S. and D.W. – who both had criminal pasts were sentenced for trafficking in women. The victims were two Polish women, one of them 16 years old. The older woman was contacted by D.W., who knew her before. She consented to travel from Poland to Germany with Ł.S. to work there as a prostitute. The juvenile victim was in conflict with her parents and wished to go abroad to work as a cleaner or a waitress; she was an acquaintance of Ł.S.’s partner. She was taken by Ł.S. and his partner (who was a prostitute in Germany), and crossed the border between Poland and Germany under a fake name. In Germany, the young victim fully depended on Ł.S. and his partner, and was probably sexually abused. After some time, she was transported to a brothel in Hamburg.The District Court established that, in 2000, Ł.S., who lived in Hamburg (Germany), visited his cousins in Poland, D.W. being one of them. He informed them that he knew people in a German escort agency who were interested in engaging women from Poland. D.W. contacted Anonymous 1, who wanted to work in that character. While travelling to Germany with Ł.S., Anonymous 1 was informed how much she would receive and that she would be sharing the money with the owner of the brothel and Ł.S. After some time, D.W. called Anonymous 1 in Germany, learned that she had serious nosebleeds and told her that someone from Poland would come get her, although she had to be prepared to give that person 30% of the money she had received from prostitution. Before that happened, Anonymous 1 was detained by German police and sent to Poland, without permission to re-enter Germany. Ł.S. visited Anonymous 1 in Poland to find out whether she told the German police about Ł.S. and his cousins.Ł.S. explained to the court, inter alia, that he had expected to receive some benefit for putting his cousins in touch with those people in Germany, but he never received such benefits from Anonymous 1 or his cousins.The District Court further established that Ł.S. and his live-in partner came to Poland in 2001. Ł.S.’s partner met Anonymous 2, who was 16 at the time. Anonymous 2 had a difficult relationship with her parents. Ł.S.’s partner offered to help her find a job as a cleaner or a waitress in Germany. Ł.S. found and used a false passport to let Anonymous 2 cross the border between Germany and Poland.  While Anonymous 2 was staying in an apartment owned by Ł.S.’s acquaintances, Ł.S. took some photos of her which he intended to publish on the Internet, offering a “girl for sale.” At some point, Ł.S. told Anonymous 2 that she would work as a prostitute at the same place where Ł.S.’s partner worked. Ł.S. abused Anonymous 2 sexually, saying that since she was going to work as a prostitute she was no longer innocent. She received lingerie and was transported to a brothel. Initially, she did not receive money, which changed after some time. Anonymous 2 had to share the money with Ł.S. and the brothel’s owner. Anonymous 2 escaped from the agency before the arrival of the police, stayed in Germany for some time (making a living also from prostitution). Anonymous 2 returned to Poland in 2002.Anonymous 2 testified that at some point she refused to continue working as a prostitute, but she was threatened by Ł.S. with a gun. Ł.S. made Anonymous 2 call her mother several times to tell her that she was fine.The court also established that D.W. persuaded Anonymous 1 to go to Germany for prostitution with direct intent. It was found that the role of D.W. was to hand over to Ł.S. a woman who wished to travel to Hamburg and become a prostitute. The District Court also found that after persuading Anonymous 1, D.W. engaged in trafficking in persons acting together with other individuals. It was logical to assume that D.W. expected to obtain a profit for that service (for himself or for someone else). This assumption was confirmed by the witness testimony of Anonymous 1 concerning her telephone call with D.W. when he announced that someone would come get her and take her to Poland in return for 30% of her money from prostitution. D.W. did not transport Anonymous 1 to Germany because, as he explained, he did not have a passport. Even so, he facilitated Anonymous 1’s engaging in prostitution by putting her in contact with Ł.S.Before the District Court sentenced Ł.S. for trafficking in women, he was deprived of liberty (probably temporarily arrested).",other crimes,1
"B.Z., during his stay in Germany (1992-1996), had met two German men, S.S. and M.O., who worked in the night club industry, including the sexual services industry. After B.Z.’s comeback to Poland, he started his own business – an escort agency in Lublin. B.Z. was also organizing meetings for his German fellows S.S and M.O. with Polish women working in Lublin's escort agencies. S.S. and M.O. proposed the Polish women to leave Poland to work in their German night clubs and to provide sexual services.A.J. was offered a position of “manageress” and was told that the Germans would come to pick her up. After A.J. accepted the offer, B.Z. arranged her transportation to Germany. Consequently, A.J. went to the Polish-German border in Słubice – Frankfurt where she met M.O. who was waiting for her in a local hotel. They crossed the border together. A.J. was responsible for picking up the phone, explaining prices and also providing sexual services.B.W. was another sexual worker of one of the Lublin's escort agencies, who agreed to leave Poland. B.Z. set the day of departure and also arranged the transportation – B.W. was accompanied to the German border by one of female friends of the Defendant. In Germany she was picked up by M.O. and lodged in the escort agency, owned by S.S., where she was providing sexual services from June 1996 to July 1998 when she was deported by German Police.M.F. started to work - she was just picking up the phone - in the escort agency owned by B.Z. in July 1997. Later, she left and started providing sexual services in another agency. While working for B.Z.'s agency, she learnt about departures to Germany organized by B.Z. She left to Germany, accompanied by S.S. and M.O. in August 1997. Before her departure, B.Z. met German citizens in the hotel - M.F., O.Y. and E.M., who also participated in the meeting. Once in Germany, she was lodged in a brothel and after a month she moved to another one. She was working in different clubs until January 1998 when she was deported by German Police.B.W., A.J. and M.F., at the very first stage of their stay in Germany were obliged to work off the amount of 2 000 Deutsche Mark (DM). It was the equivalent of the price paid by the German owners to the B.Z. for the procurement.B.W. and A.J. learnt about this condition after the transfer to Germany. B.Z was taking money directly from S.S. and M.O. who were collecting money from women afterwards. Part of the money earned by women was destined to pay off the dept.The defendant, at all stages of investigation and court trial, refused to submit his explanations and maintained his innocence. He affirmed that he had known the German citizens and helped the women find employment in the night clubs to leave Poland. However, he argued that he had not been aware of the nature of the work performed in Germany and denied having received any kind of remuneration for his assistance from women or German citizens. He stated that the women had left Poland of their own volition and he had never forced them to do so. Moreover, the women were not deprived of their freedom: they were always in possession of their passports and were able to come back to Poland on many occasions. Finally, he alleged that women were forced to submit false testimony since they had been threatened by the police.",other crimes,0
"The victims (citizens of Belarus, Ukraine and Bulgaria) were in difficult financial circumstances. Anonymous 1 was unemployed when she lived in Grodno (Belarus). Anonymous 1 was offered a job waitressing in Poland by C. C was a citizen of Belarus with a Polish surname, a taxi driver living in Belarus, who was an acquaintance of Anonymous A, living in Poland. In January 2003, C transported Anonymous 1 to Poland (Warsaw), where Anonymous A “bought” her for 400 USD and took away her passport. After a couple of days Anonymous 1 was informed that she would work as a prostitute; she did for 10 months, receiving 400 USD per month and returned to Belarus. Also in January 2003, Anonymous 3 was offered a job in prostitution by C, which she accepted because she had economic problems. C took Anonymous 3 together with Anonymous 2 and his wife by car to Poland, where he took away the passports of Anonymous 2 and Anonymous 3 and contacted Anonymous A. Anonymous A “bought” Anonymous 2 and Anonymous 3 for 400 USD and 600 USD, respectively; C’s wife went shopping in a nearby shopping centre. Anonymous 3 was then “sold” to another Bulgarian; she worked as a prostitute for 40 days, and returned to Grodno (Belarus). Anonymous 3 worked in Poland as a prostitute for 40 days for the second time in May 2003.

She was detained twice before her deportation to Belarus in November 2003.Anonymous 4 contacted C though another woman living in Belarus. Anonymous 4 was supporting a son after losing her husband in 2002, so she contacted C and travelled to Poland together with Anonymous 5. Anonymous 5 was offered a job as a seller in an open air market for 100 USD per month. Anonymous 4 and Anonymous 5 arrived in Poland (near Warsaw) in February 2003, when they met Anonymous A. Anonymous A “bought” Anonymous 4 and “sold” her to a Bulgarian, for whom she worked for two weeks. Anonymous 5’s passport was in the possession of C and Anonymous A after he “bought” her. Anonymous A placed Anonymous 5 in his apartment where Anonymous 2, two Ukrainian women and two Bulgarian men lived. The next day, Anonymous A took Anonymous 5 and a Ukrainian woman to a road by car, where Anonymous 5 hid in the woods; the next day, she took her passport and went back to Belarus.C also offered jobs in Poland to Anonymous 6, Anonymous 7 and Anonymous 8. Anonymous 6 was told she would work as a waitress (although she guessed the real nature of the offered work); Anonymous 7 needed money for rent and borrowed it from C, promising to return it after she earned it in Poland. Anonymous 6, Anonymous 7 and Anonymous 8 travelled with C to Poland in February 2003. Anonymous 6 and Anonymous 8 were “bought” and “sold” by Anonymous A to another Bulgarian man for 500 USD; they refused to work as prostitutes and were told they had to give the Bulgarian what he had “paid” for them. Anonymous 6 and Anonymous 8 were transported to a road linking Warsaw and Katowice. Soon after the “transaction,” Anonymous 8 had a nervous breakdown. Anonymous 6 escaped with a Polish man after two weeks. Anonymous 7 was taken by Anonymous A to a small town near Warsaw and had to engage in roadside prostitution. After 40 days she had earned 500 USD, of which she received 150 PLN. Anonymous 7 did not give back the money to C, so she returned to Poland with C in April 2003, when she was “sold” to Anonymous A for the second time. Anonymous 7 worked for Anonymous A until July 2003; altogether she earned 300 USD.Anonymous 9 knew C as a taxi driver. She had her own business in Grodno (Belarus) which failed and she had to pay a fine of 800 USD. She contacted C, who told her that she could work as a prostitute in Poland. After some time she agreed, provided that she would work in a hotel. She arrived in Poland in June 2003. Anonymous A “bought” Anonymous 9 from C for 1000 USD. She refused to work by the roadside and was threatened to be “sold” to France.  Every day, Anonymous A took Anonymous 9 and Anonymous 2 to a road for prostitution. Both of the victims had cell phones on which they could only receive calls. Anonymous 9 “paid back” the 1000 USD to Anonymous A after two days. After four days, she refused to continue working, but Anonymous A started to give her calming pills, hit her in the head twice and threatened that he would sell her to Bulgarians who were violent against women.

She thought that she would work as a prostitute in a hotel. Anonymous 10 arrived in Poland in July 2003 and was “sold” to Anonymous A for 500 USD. After some time, she was “sold” to another Bulgarian and worked until August 2003, when she was detained and deported to Belarus.Anonymous 11 could not make a living, so she contacted a friend in Belarus who put her in touch with C. C offered a job in Poland involving prostitution in a pub. C phoned Anonymous A in the presence of Anonymous 11; she confirmed with Anonymous A that Anonymous 11 would receive a lot of money. Before she went to Poland, Anonymous 11 lost her father and was afraid that she did not have enough money to leave for her child. C convinced her that she should go and bought her a train ticket to Warsaw. Anonymous 11 entrusted her jewellery to C, who did not deliver it to her friend as he said he would. Anonymous A picked up Anonymous 11 from the train station in Warsaw and gave her 400 USD “for C”. C demanded that he should receive 50 USD more when Anonymous 11 returns to Belarus. Anonymous 11 worked on the roadside as a prostitute until October 2003. She returned to Poland in November 2003 as Anonymous 2 had offered her a job as a prostitute in France, but she stayed in Poland; after two weeks, Anonymous 11 was detained by the Polish police and deported to Belarus.Anonymous 12 was in difficult financial circumstances and her husband abused her and her child. A friend told her she could work in Poland in a pub as a prostitute.

After two days in Warsaw, Anonymous 12 was “sold” to another Bulgarian man; she worked as a prostitute until November 2003, when she was found by the Polish police.Anonymous 13 was a live-in partner of Anonymous B. Anonymous B took her to a road for prostitution and benefited from that practice.Some of the victims gave witness testimony in Belarus; the District Court took that testimony into account when establishing the above facts of the case.Below is the account as provided in the Report on Trafficking in Poland in Human Beings published by the Ministry of Interior and Administration in Warsaw, 2008 (http://prostitution.procon.org/sourcefiles/PolandTraffickingInHumanBeingsReport2008.pdf):“Between 2003 and 2005 the Podlasie Border Guard Division conducted three proceedings concerning trafficking in human beings supervised by the District Prosecutor’s Office in Białystok.On 23 October 2003 a Belarusian citizen came to the Podlasie Border Guard Division and submitted a notification of crime consisting in her sale by the Belarusian citizen to a Bulgarian citizen. The Appellate Prosecutor’s Office in Białystok entrusted the investigation to the Border Guard. Legal qualification of the initiation of the proceedings – Article 253 (1) of the Penal Code[...]. As a result of the proceedings, preceded by the testimonies of 5 women – victims, a citizen of Bulgaria was arrested in November 2003. In addition, it was established that a Belarusian citizen [in this document referred to as “C”] was responsible for the recruitment of women in Belarus.Following further questioning, as a result of operation and investigation activities, theplace of stay of the second suspect (a Bulgarian citizen as well) was established. He wasarrested in December 2003. The further investigation allowed to establish that a third suspect(a Bulgarian citizen) participated in this practice as well. As a result, in February 2004 adecision was issued about the seeking of the suspect by “wanted” notice. On 6 October 2004the materials concerning the third prostitution procurer were excluded by the prosecutor forseparate proceedings. On 25 October 2004 the proceedings were suspended. The suspect wasarrested on 12 November 2005 at the road border crossing of Zasieki, as a result of which theproceedings were launched and registered under a new number.The investigation used inter alia the possibilities from Article 316 (3) of the Code ofPenal Procedure (If there is a danger that the suspect cannot be questioned at the trial, abody conducting the proceedings, may submit a motion to the court demanding that thesuspect be heard by the court). The close cooperation was conducted with the Authorities ofBorder Troops of the Republic of Belarus, and with the officer at the Bulgarian Embassy inPoland. In addition, by means of international legal assistance, the District Prosecutor’sOffice in Białystok applied to the Prosecutor’s Offices in Belarus, Ukraine and Bulgaria andobtained the necessary assistance.In October 2004 the materials concerning the citizen of Belarus who recruited womenin his country [in this document referred to as “C”] were excluded from the discussed case. On 16 December 2005 the prosecution of the crime was transferred to the territory of Belarus. He was sentenced to a 7.5 year inprison and forfeiture.By the decision of the District Court in Białystok III K 92/05 of 19 August 2005, twoaccused were found guilty of acts imputed thereto and sentenced to 5 years and 3 years 4month in prison.

"Three men were accused that in the period from 2004 to 2007 in Sweden, acting for the purpose of financial gain, they committed two counts of trafficking in human beings. They misinformed their victims on the possibility of taking legal employment in Sweden in construction work, recruited and transported at their own expense, under the guise of taking employment described previously.In reality the perpetrators used the position of victims and their weakness resulting from residence in a foreign country without knowing the local language, and without financial resources necessary to meet the basic necessities of life, and forced victims to shoplifting. The accused benefited from the stolen property, paying little sums of money to victims, money not sufficient to finance their return to Poland. That situation forced further stay of victims in Sweden, and continuing executing shoplifting, what made regular source of income for perpetrators.Some of the victims had even more difficult situation, as they were expelled from Sweden previously and therefore their stay there was illegal.Some perpetrators were using violence against victims, involving beating them in the head, in their face, threatening with deprivation of life using knifes. Some of the victims had their IDs taken away.One of the victims refused to perform shoplifting and run away back to Poland, then another group of victims decided to leave Sweden at the end of 2006.",trafficking in persons,1
"Nikolae L., his wife Kamila L. and his brother Ioan L. were accused of trafficking in human beings since 2006 to 2012. They acted in the following way: recruited, transported to Poland, then located in Ścinawa 28 Romanian citizens to force them to work. Defendants mislead the victims about working conditions, as well as used their critical life situation and helplessness due to a lack of livelihood and knowledge of the language. The perpetrators were hiding IDs of the victims, using violence and unlawful threats. The perpetrators were also violating labour rights by forcing the victims to work overtime and not reporting to social security system.The case was revealed when two Romanians run away and with no IDs were detained at the railway station in Krakow.As it was found, Nikolae L. recruited persons willing to work in Poland in two small villages at a time when he went to visit his family for Christmas. The victims came from very poor families, also minors were recruited with the consent of their parents, who had previously received part of the money. They were assured they will be provide with a transport to Poland, accommodation, meals and remuneration in the amount of 600 to 2,500Euro for 10 months of work. In Poland, they lived in rooms from 2 to 12 persons with no hot water. Their food and possibility to go out were limited, their documents and phones taken away from them. They were often forced to work app. 18 hours a day, humiliated and threatened.The indictment in this case was sent by District Prosecutor's Office in Lublin in December 2012. At the beginning, all the accused were detained temporarily, then bailed in the amount of 50,000PLN, with police supervision and a prohibition to leave the country.The defendants did not admit to committing the offense both in the investigation and in court.During the trial, the court interrogated Romanian victims with the use of video conference system as they returned to their country.",trafficking in persons,1
"In this case, the victim was homeless, living at the station, in conflict with her family, and she prostituted from time to time to earn for living. She met EK and they talked about her difficult life situations. EK said that he knew a man, his friend, who could help her, and that she could sleep and stay at this friend's. In return she would cook, clean up or take care of his mother.EK took the victim by car to WZ, where she recognised him as she used to work for him as a prostitute in Germany. She was informed about the character of work after they arrived at place. The victim admitted that she agreed to work for WZ  practicing prostitution from November 2002 to February 2006, because her living situation forced her to this.By the end of 2004 she learned that she was sold for 300PLN at the time when EK took her to WZ.The District Court came to the conclusion that the act committed by the accused constituted ""trafficking in human being"" within the meaning of definition of this term. The first instance court, according to the findings, concluded that the defendants entered into an agreement under which the accused EK had to bring the victim in order to sell her to WZ for the purpose of using her in prostitution, what actually happened. For this purpose EK consciously mislead the victim about the nature of the aid. He brought her to the meeting place near the shop and passed her to WZ in return of money.",trafficking in persons,1
"At the beginning of 2013, the Police received the notification of an offense from two women, 35-year-old Bulgarian and her 16-year-old daughter. In the course of preparatory proceeding the prosecutor's office has revealed that the girl's mother appeared in Poland in 2008 and provided paid sexual services in Świdnica and surroundings. The accused promised to marry her and live together in the country. At the end of 2012 also the daughter of the woman arrived to Poland. Using a relation of dependency and critical position of a minor, the man was organizing her contacts with persons of Turkish origin via Skype.At undetermined date between December 2012 and February 2013 the defendant contacted the man nicknamed ""Domus"", offering him a transfer of an underage girl in order to exploit her in prostitution; an act that was not carried out.Although the exploitation of both daughter and mother were included in the indictment, the court found the perpetrator guilty only in respect of acts committed against a minor.",trafficking in persons,1
"In 2013, after seven years of trial, the District Court in Kraków issued a judgment in a case of transnational criminal group engaged in human trafficking for forced labour. 22 people were accused in the case and 20 of them were found guilty of trafficking in human beings.Criminal activity took place in southern Italy in 2002-2006. Thanks to the operation dubbed ""The Promised Land"", conducted jointly by the Polish and Italian law enforcement, 119 victims - Polish citizens were identified.In July 2005, the Municipal Police Headquarters in Kraków carried out an investigation of a crime under deception in organising trips to illegal work in the Republic of Italy.Also, at the beginning of 2006, there occurred information on the disappearances of people in unknown circumstances in forced labour camps in southern Italy.In the preparatory proceedings it was revealed that the criminal group (leaded by three main defendants) was organised and the competences were divided. There were “recruiters”, who were responsible for giving the false promises and recruit people to work abroad. Then “carriers”, that took the money and transferred the people to Italy. The owners of the camps were called “kapo” and they physically and mentally enslaved the victims. The main beneficiaries of slave labour victims were so-called ""landlords"" from the region Puglia who were in continuous cooperation with the ""kapo"".",trafficking in persons,1
"The defendants were found guilty of multiple charges by the Białystok District Court. A.S. was found guilty of purchase and further distribution of 900 grams of cocaine, R.K. was found guilty of human trafficking for the purchase of 2 women and for forcing them to perform sexual services for his benefit, and D.P. was found guilty of falsely reporting the theft of his car.The appellate court revised the case and decided that the crimes committed did not constitute the defendants’ permanent source of income.",trafficking in persons,1
"Between January 2005 and March 2009, D.K. created and lead an illegal escort agency, through which she forced various women into prostitution, with the help of H.B., J.K., I.G. and M.B.There is not much information about how the organisation chose their victims; however, the main common denominator seems to be a pre-existent position of vulnerability. In the case of K.K., her luggage was stolen from her while she was travelling, and taken to the escort agency. The victim was thus lured to that place under the pretext of collecting her belongings, but instead she was imprisoned and threatened to force her into prostitution. The victim, however, managed to escape and avoid being subjected to sexual exploitation.Another example of abuse based on a position of vulnerability is the intimidating tactics  directed against A.G., who was threatened with the deprivation of her parental rights, as she was facing multiple fines. Similarly, the defendants also abused the similarly difficult financial situations of victims: I.O., I.K, B.B. and A.B.While I.G.´s and M.B.´s crimes were merely involved assisting with escort agency operations, H.B and J.K. committed multiple acts of violence on behalf of D.K. Nearly all the victims were beaten and threatened with severe bodily harm or even death of themselves or their family members. Additionally, defendant J.K. provided 5 mg of amphetamine to victim M.J on multiple occasions.Furthermore, along with the crimes mentioned above, defendants H.B. and D.K. committed several counts of extortion. In particular, P.B. and H.B. demanded 5 000 euro from I.K. and J.B in order to allow them to stop prostituting themselves. What is more, H.B. attempted to force J.S. into disposing of 4000 PLN for the defendant’s profit.",trafficking in persons,1
"Victims O.K. and O.M. were recruited by D.A. in Belarus, by means of deception, to work as prostitutes in Poland. P.O. convinced them to travel to Poland with the promise of a good, well-paid job in Warsaw. When they arrived in Poland on September14th, P.O. confiscated their passports and forced them to engage in prostitution in his apartment. P.O. forbade the victims from going out, and used threats of violence as means of coercion. P.O. paid D.A. 400 $ for each of the victims. Then, P.O. “sold” O.M. to a sex-shop run by A., where O.M. was forced to work as an erotic dancer. The victims were told to work to repay the money that P.O. had paid for them. On the 28th of December, when the victims finished “paying off their debt”, P.O. allowed them to go home. Victims N.R. and A.Z were recruited by J.B. with a similar modus operandi as O.K. and O.M. P.O. paid 800 $ for N.R. and an unknown amount of money for A.Z., and forced them to offer sexual services in an apartment until they were able to repay the money that P.O. had paid for them. A.Z. was “sold” to M.K. for 400 PLN to work as an erotic dancer in his sex-shop. P.O. promised A.G. employment in Poland. However, when she arrived, he transferred her to M.K. with the purpose of exploiting her prostitution in M.K.’s sex-shop. The same happened with respect to T.N. and I.I. I.I. earned 2.800 PLN providing different sexual services, but she only received 120 PLN out of this money. P.O. sent the victims to clients, confiscated their passports and kept part of the money earned, even in those cases where the victims were minors. A.S. took advantage of the economic difficulties and financial problems of the Belarusian women, lied to them regarding the real nature of the job offered in Poland. Her work was to send victims to the clients, pick up the clients’ calls, give the clients information about external appearance, type of sexual service and price. A.S. collected the money from the victims in the name of P.O.",trafficking in persons,1
"The Court held that considering all proven evidence, there can be no doubt that the defendants established and then led an organized criminal group. They planned the whole criminal enterprise and began to seek people willing to cooperate. All members were referred to the criminal group via friends or through their social network, which is typical in organized criminal groups.With the purpose of recruiting members, B.L. induced the sister of co-defendant D.F., his friend Ż. D., to ""recruit"" people to engage in theft in different countries of the European Union. He also organized personal meetings, with the purpose of explaining the process to future members. To convince recruits to go abroad, the defendants offered them jobs in hotels or in agriculture (e.g. room cleaning etc.). They repeteadly assured their victims that the job would be fully legal. All of the  members of the group found out the real purpose of the trip when they were already on the way.Defendants B.L. and D.F. organized the entire criminal enterprise. They rented a car to transport the group to France, where the members of the group were supposed to commit multiple thefts. They also organized accommodation, as well as procuring ""tools"" e.g. travel bags (which were covered with aluminum foil and used to take stolen supplies out of the store) and mobile phones, which were used during the thefts.  After commiting each theft, the defendants took the stolen goods away and kept them for themselves. They also decided who would receive payment for ""services provided"". This meant that they were responsible for distributing the profits obtained through the criminal acts committed.The defendants disciplined members of the group by rationing the food according to someone's ""achievements"" in the thefts committed. They also used physical and psychological violence to discipline the group, for example when someone wanted to withdraw from committing crimes. The defendants, for example, beat one of the members of the group by kicking him and putting their feet on his head and then left him alone in the forest.

Greece (for more information see: https://sherloc.unodc.org/cld/case-law-doc/traffickingpersonscrimetype/_irb/2017/chowdury_and_others_v._greece.html?lng=en&tmpl=sherloc).   This is the decision on an appeal by way of cassation in the interest of the law lodged by the Prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Greece (Areios Pagos), concerning the part of the acquittal from the charges of trafficking n persons of the decision 75-81, 85-87, 111-128/2014 of the Patras Assize Court.  The Supreme Court upheld the appeal, which however does not affect the res judicata. For its part, in its judgment of 30 July 2014, the Assize Court acquitted the four defendants on the charge of human trafficking. The workers’ lawyers then applied to the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation requesting that he appeal on points of law against the judgment of the Assize Court. In their application they contended that the Assize Court had not adequately examined the charge of trafficking in human beings. They considered that, in order to determine whether that court had correctly applied Article 323A of the Criminal Code, it was necessary to examine whether advantage had been taken of any vulnerability of the foreign nationals in order to exploit them. On 27 October 2014 the prosecutor refused to lodge an appeal. He gave reasons for his decision, indicating only that the statutory conditions for an appeal on points of law were not met. As a result of this decision, the part of the 30 July 2014 judgment concerning human trafficking became “irrevocable”.",trafficking in persons,1

The two women accepted to meet men in various hotels and apartments of Athens chosen by the clients. For each sexual intercourse each woman was paid 75 EUR; an amount that they had to hand over to the driver who would take them to the “appointment”. According to the defendant in order to pay off their debt they had to have sex with 270 men each. After the sexual meetings, the driver was taking them to the apartment where he locked them up until the next day where this or another driver was taking them to the “appointments”.The criminal activity and sexual exploitation of the above women continued until 4.4.2006, where one of the girls managed to reach the balcony and started screaming for help.

They actively participated in a network that had affiliates in Russia and Greece with the aim of finding pretty adult women in Russia, and sending them into Greece via labour searching offices in Russia.When these women arrived in Greece they were received by network members who acted in Greece, who removed them their passports, locked them in apartments and forced them by threats to prostitute against their will. For their movements they used leased vehicles and not their own cars, to avoid their seizure in case of their arrest.In this case, Β.Τ. had removed the passports of the two foreign women, and kept them locked in an apartment rented from Α.Κ.

"During July 2007, law enforcement received information that defendant D.B. was facilitating  illicit activities in exchange for money, and taking advantage of women in vulnerable positions. These caused law enforcement to put the defendant’s house under surveillance. One of the people, E.I., who was monitoring the entering and leaving in the defendant’s house was confronted by police. E.I. told police that he had been coming to the defendant house for the last seven to eight years to pay for sexual services with women the defendant had at his house. E.I. would pay amounts of sixty to eighty euros for sexual services from the victims. One of the victims, M., was who E.I. paid for that night.Later law enforcement conducted a home search of the defendant’s residence, where both victims, M. and O. were found being hosted and maintained by the defendant. Upon further investigation of the residence, police found condoms and gels, 525 euros, and mobile phones. Furthermore, the residence was setup in such a way where there were several rooms for the “clients” and victims to have intercourse. Both victims and the defendant were arrested.On 12/7/2007, M. met an unknown man named “A”, in Athens. A. promised M. work in a restaurant, where she would be paid 100-150 euros.

There, A. and the defendant explained to M. that she would prostitute for money. With the current situation M. was in, (i.e. not having money, not having current visa to stay in Greece, lacking legal documents to legitimately work in Greece, and not being able to speak Greek) she felt she had no other choice but to agree. The defendant deliberately took advantage of the situation, knowing that M. was in a difficult situation.

"The Applicant entered Greek territory on 9 June 2004 with a person she had met in her home country of Nigeria, K.A. K.A. promised the Applicant that she would be taken to Greece to work in bars and nightclubs, and before leaving Nigeria, made the Applicant swear before a so-called ‘voodoo priest’ that she would owe K.A. 40,000 Euro and that she would not notify the Greek authorities of her activities for fear of engaging a voodoo curse.  Upon her arrival in Greece, the Applicant states that K.A. confiscated her passport and forced her to engage in prostitution. The Applicant states that she engaged in prostitution for fear of activating the abovementioned voodoo curse, believing that the only means for freeing herself from this curse was by paying K.A.  40,000 Euro. Additionally, the Applicant states that she did not have her passport and feared that she would be deported to Nigeria and that her relatives in Nigeria would be threatened if she sought help from the Greek authorities. During the period of her prostitution, the Applicant remained in contact with the NGO ‘Nea Zoi’ (New Life - Νέα Ζωή) which provided her with material and psychological support and represented the Applicant before the European Court of Human Rights. On 12 July 2004 and 8 June 2005 the Applicant submitted an application for asylum in person at the Athens Aliens Bureau. On the latter date, she was informed that a place at the Red Cross Reception Center for Asylum Seekers in the Fthiotida Department had become available for her, though she did not avail herself of this place. Subsequently, the Applicant was the subject of several indictments for prostitution and illegal entry and stay of a foreigner. The Applicant brought a case to the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that she was a victim of trafficking in persons, having been subjected to commercial sexual exploitation by K.A. and another named party, D.J. The applicant claimed that D.J. was acquitted for the charge of trafficking in persons, and K.A. absconded while on bail, and has not since been the subject of a prosecution for trafficking in persons. The Applicant alleges that the Greek State failed to comply with its positive obligations under Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), with particular regard to the fact that the failure of her protection as a victim of trafficking, the absconding of K.A. and the failure of the State’s procedural obligations resulted in a violation of Article 4 ECHR. The applicant further claimed a violation of the right to effective remedy under Article 6 ECHR. The Court considers that in the present case the duration to the litigious proceedings was excessive and does not meet the requirement of reasonable time, thus constituting a violation of Article 6(1) ECHR with regard to the duration of the proceedings. The Court further found that there had been a violation of Article 13 ECHR on account of the absence, at the material time, of a remedy in domestic law which would have enabled the applicant to obtain the sanction of having her case heard within a reasonable time. Finally, the Court found that a lack of a prompt operational response in favour of the applicant resulted in a violation of the Applicant’s rights under Article 4 ECHR.",trafficking in persons,1

She contacted defendant A. by phone, with whom X. had a family acquaintance with. X. told A. about her financial problems and A.  told X. that X. could travel to Greece, through Turkey, to secure a job and housing. In April 2009, X. travelled to Greece, with the assistance of men who were associates with the defendants. These men informed X. that the cost of moving to Greece was 60,000 EUR.Before X. actually made the trip to Greece and after she arrived in the country she subjected to a ‘Voodoo’ ceremony, which is used to intimidate the victim, threatened them into obeying orders or they will die. X. had no other choice but to obey and prostitute herself every day in the Omonoia area of Athens, after which she would give all her money to the defendants, where they would document it in a blue journal. It was documented that X. has made 42,000 EUR by 2-9-2010.The same tactic was used by the defendants to coerce Z., another Nigerian women. When Z. was living in Nigeria, she was connected by a woman (F.), who collaborated with the defendants, convincing her to come to Greece. Z. thought she was going to be hosted at defendant A.’s house, who was a hairdresser, and was assured that they would find work for her as a hairdresser too. Prior to Z.’s departure and upon her arrival, she was submitted to a ‘Voodoo’ ceremony. The departure ceremony included the slaughtering of a rooster and after which she was forced to eat his heart. After the ceremony, they gave her travel documents and instructions on her various points of the journey. Z. arrived in Greece, via Turkey, in November 2009. The defendants used threats and force to persuade Z. into obeying and starting to prostitute. Defendant A often beat Z. if she wasn’t happy with the money Z. brought back. In the beginning of 2010, Z. persuaded the defendants to let her go to church. Z. then was able to find rescue at the church of Mormons, where they brought her in contact with an organization that called the police and was able to report what happened.

After which X. revealed she was coerced to prostitute for money.  Due to cultural held understandings of the ‘Voodoo’ rituals, the defendants had caused to both victims a great amount of fear for their lives and for the lives of their families. At these ceremonies they were submitted in order to obey against their will to prostitute for money that they should deliver to the first of the defendants compulsorily. It results also from the testimonies that they were obliged to remain at home, until they collect the amount that defendants A. had told them that they owed to her for their trip to Greece.",trafficking in persons,1

A.I. called the contact person indicated on the job advertisement and talked with the unknown Romanian lady, who gave her the address of an apartment in Bucharest and asked her to go there to discuss in person and receive more information.On 9 December 2004, the plaintiff went to the apartment in Bucharest. There, she met with the unknown Romanian lady she had spoken to on the phone, who did not say what her name was, and with G.G.. G.G. informed A.I that there was a very good job with high salary for her as a translator in Greece. He also told her that her employer would advance 1,000 euros for her transportation to Greece, and that he would deduct this money from her salary.A.I. was convinced and accepted the job of translator. As soon as A.I. accepted, on the same day, G. made copies of A.I.’s passport and id card and left the apartment to arrange for A.I.’s travel to Greece, while A.I. and the unknown lady stayed in the apartment. When G. G. returned, he gave A.I. an airplane ticket for a flight on the same from Bucharest to Athens. A.I. packed up her things and went to the airport with G. G. by taxi, On their way to the airport, G. G gave A.I. his personal telephone number and 500 euros for her first expenses. He told her that upon arrival at the Athens airport somebody would be waiting for her to take her to her workplace.When they reached the Bucharest airport, G. G, accompanied A.I. to the departures hall and then he left. A.I. landed in Athens at 9.20 pm the same day, where defendant S.T. was waiting for her. S.T. approached her and asked her if her name was A.I., and the plaintiff confirmed as she recognized the person that G. had described to her. S.T. drove A.I. on his white BMW to hotel “X” in Athens, where the plaintiff spent the night. On their way to the hotel, S.T. took the 500 euros that G. hade given A.I., saying that this money “belonged to the company”, and gave her his telephone number.On the next day, 10 December 2004, defendant S.T. went back to the hotel, picked up A.I., took her to the Athens Airport and gave her an airplane ticket for Chania, a city in Creta in the south of Greece, where supposedly A.I. would work as a translator.  S.T. was aware that A.I. would not work as a translator but rather as prostitute in a nightclub owned by K.M. for a fee of 25 euros per person.A.I. boarded the flight to Chania where K.M was waiting for her. He took her to his nightclub in the centre of the city of Chania, There, a Moldavian employee D.D. who spoke Romanian, explained to A.I. what the job was about. D.D. told A.I. that she would have to dress up in a provocative attire, keep company to the customers of the nightclub and encourage them to offer her drinks. For each drink, A.I. would receive one euro and if the customer wished, she would have sex with him at a special room in the second floor of the nightclub for 25 euros.When A.I. learned what her job was, she was terrified and told D.D. that she had come to Greece to work as a translator. Following this, D.D took A.I. to her apartment to have some rest, and then she took her back to the nightclub where she met K.M. When A.I. told K.M. that she refused to work as a prostitute, K.M. was very disappointed and called the second defendant to complain. A.I could tell the two of them were arguing but she could not understand what exactly they were talking about as they were talking in Greek.After the telephone call, K.M. asked A.I. to pack her things and he, together with an unknown man, took her by car to the Chania Airport. There, K.M. purchased an airplane ticket to Athens for A.I. and left the Airport, leaving A.I. with the unknown man who was supposed to ensure that she would not escape. This notwithstanding, A.I. managed to approach H.K., customs officer at the Chania Airport,  and talk to him about her situation, H.K. suggested that she should report the case to the competent authorities.  A few minutes later, the unknown man took A.I.’s luggage, accompanied her to the departures hall and told her that S, i.e. defendant S.T, would be waiting for her at the Athens Airport.After the aircraft’s departure, A.I. asked one of the flight attendants for help.

"Before the court appeared three defendants. Those are two Belgian natural persons, a man, named in the judgment as M.V. and a woman, named C.R., as well as a legal person. The previous defendant’s owned and operated horse stable company SAP, which also functioned as a horse riding school. On appeal from a judgment of a Liège criminal court in 2016, the appeals court of Liège determined the facts of the case as follows: among the three identified employees counted two Moroccan nationals, incidentally also brothers, identified as B.S.S and B.S.Y. They were recruited to enter Belgium illegally and housed in order to work for the defendants and their legal entity. The male defendant has accepted responsibility for the hiring of the migrant worker S.B.S. and having accepted the arrival of the younger migrant worker from Morocco. Whilst it was mentioned that the migration of the two workers was a result of the efforts of their families, it is not determined within the facts of the case, whether either of the defendants were involved or otherwise participated in the facilitation of the illegal entry into Belgium. Merely in the deliberation of the charge of migrant smuggling, the level of responsibility for having employed the Moroccan brothers was attributed to the actus reus of the crime and was established as having had an alleviative effect on the economic burden of the families. Under the defendant’s employment, the migrants’ tasks generally included the upkeeping of the riding arena under supervision in addition to caring for the horses, although it was established that the younger brother, B.S.Y., and B.S.S. have shouldered different shares of tasks. The workers testified that they have received instructions on their work to be performed from the male defendant who communicated work instructions through the older brother only since the younger brother was not able to speak French sufficiently. Meanwhile, the female defendant had an overall directive function and had almost daily contact with the workers, who are found to have been in a subordinate relationship with their employers. The statements by the brothers reveal that they have been labouring at least full-time, but the legal obligations applicable under Belgian labour law, i.e., social obligations such as occupational accident insurance and social security benefits, were not complied with as there was a failure to pay social security contributions to the National Social Security Office. The female defendant, being the legal manager of the horse riding and stable company, had failed to protect the workers in guaranteeing these benefits and, thus, the lack of action is construed as a positive act of participation warranting criminal responsibility. Although attempts were made to regularize their irregular status in Belgium, no further steps were initiated to complete that process. Instead, the migrant brothers continued to work long hours for the defendants and their company in exchange for an unusually low wage. Furthermore, they were housed in poor conditions, e.g. without heating or hot water.The defendants are charged for the crime of trafficking in human beings and the crime of aggravated migrant smuggling, as the employers had recruited, accommodated and exercised authority over the migrants with allegedly the view of exploiting their precarious situation, owing to their illegal stay in Belgium and their lack of viable alternatives to leave the employment. Other charges include the failure to comply with obligations regarding the employment of foreign workers, failure to pay the correct amount of social security contributions and, lastly, the failure to pay occupational accident insurance. When the irregular status of the older brother was discovered, the younger brother went into hiding and did not immediately trust the social services (ASBL S.) responsible for protecting victims of human  trafficking.Since the situation was brought to light due to unpaid social security obligations, the social inspectorate has determined that the wages paid to the workers were not compliant with Belgian labour law. In addition, the inspectorate has passed on to the prosecution that the legal obligations connected with employing the Moroccan migrants were not appropriately observed, e.g. no occupational accident insurance was afforded to the workers. Upon approach by the social services, the younger Moroccan brother was timid and evasive owing to the fear of discovering his precarious and irregular status and had to be reassured in order for him not to be a flight risk.",smuggling of migrants,1

The latter regularly received money from the girls, which she handed over to the first defendant. The investigation was carried out with the help of searches, a financial investigation, mobile phone and SIM card readings, analyses of the telephone traffic of the base stations, statements by victims and clients and confrontations with a selection of photos.The two defendants were convicted for the alleged offences. The first defendant was considered to be pimping young girls, including minors. She had organised at least part of their crossing from Nigeria. One of the victims had been rescued by the Italian coastguard after drifting for days. The aggravating circumstance of trafficking in human beings with endangerment of the victim's life was also retained. The second defendant offered support and assistance.

"The facts came to light as a result of an investigation by the local police in Ostend. The investigation (including wiretaps, observations and statements) soon revealed that the gang was organised, that different girls were forced into prostitution and that they had to hand over at least 40% of their earnings to the first defendant. Some girls were also required to hand over an additional percentage of the remaining amount to the other defendants. Some of the victims also had to pay the rent for their apartments. The defendants imposed the sexual acts the victims were to perform. One victim was even forced to have an abortion. The girls were threatened with voodoo practices (including the fact that they would remain indisposed for years if they dared to denounce the defendants).Several girls also reported that the first defendant regularly used physical violence and psychological coercion against them, ranging from beatings to attempted rape for refusing orders. The other defendants also threatened the victims in case of non-payment. Various searches have been organized, as well as the monitoring of various financial transactions and the reading of mobile phones. Extreme videos of child pornography were found on the mobile phones of several defendants. Searches were organized, as well as the monitoring of various financial transactions and the reading of mobile phones. Extreme videos of child pornography were found on the mobile phones of several defendants. According to the court, it was clear from the entire criminal case that this was a particularly well-organized international network that had smuggled young women, including underage, from Nigeria to Belgium for exploitation in prostitution. A few defendants were also prosecuted for the smuggling of Nigerian women from Nigeria to Belgium, via Italy, for subsequent sexual exploitation in prostitution and as escorts. The women were also subjected to voodoo rituals. One of the victims arrived at a house in Libya where she was exploited as a sex slave. Another victim was still a minor at the time. For the smuggling and their false identity or residence documents, the girls built up a so-called 'debt', which they subsequently had to pay off through prostitution and severe sexual exploitation. At first instance, all eight defendants were all sentenced to prison terms ranging from 18 months suspended to nine years, with fines ranging from 3 x 8,000 euros to 16 x 8,000 euros. Significant amounts of evidence and money were confiscated. The three civil parties were awarded compensation for non-pecuniary damage ranging from €6,500 to €12,000. The associations PAG-ASA and Payoke were each awarded 2,500 euros. Several defendants and the public prosecutor's office have appealed. In its judgment of 1 June 2018, the Ghent Court of Appeals upheld the convictions almost in their entirety.The damages of the three civil parties were also confirmed. Those awarded to PAG-ASA and Payoke were, in equity, in the absence of precise documents supporting the damage, reduced to a material damage of 1,500 euros. According to the court, the moral damage was not sufficiently demonstrated.",smuggling of migrants,1
"The federal traffic police had noticed that smuggling activities were taking place in a parking area along the E40. It had also received a call from a lorry driver concerning the presence of migrants in transit in the trailer. Three people were discovered there. Some of them had already attempted to reach the United Kingdom. After several reports, the federal traffic police reached the conclusion that a group of perpetrators were using the Wetteren parking area to smuggle migrants in transit to the United Kingdom. It requested traffic data from the mobile phone mast for analysis. The suspects' numbers were then tapped and nine observations were also carried out. The various phone taps revealed that the smugglers threatened the victims and their family with violence if the victims failed to pay. People were even struck with a wrench. Young children were also smuggled. The smugglers motivation was clearly to make money out of them. Refrigerated lorries were also used. A phone tapped conversation revealed that a victim had contacted the smuggler so that he could come and let them out because they were suffocating, and that the smuggler had done nothing to help them. The indicative prices for an illegal transportation ranged between GBP 1,000 and 3,000, depending on nationality and the family composition. The smugglers promised that every client would get to England. The money always had to be given as a guarantee first. The operations centre was in the Calais 'jungle'. In total, the human smuggling activities took place on 154 different nights, involving a total of 1,994 acts of human smuggling. These human smuggling operations were performed by a constantly changing group. For each defendant, the court examined the number of acts they had participated in. This number varied from 38 acts of human smuggling to 1,994.",smuggling of migrants,1
"One of the main defendants was an employee at the Syrian Embassy in Paris, who sold fake papers to Syrian migrants between 2013 and 2015 at a high price. Eurojust played an important role in the coordination of the international investigation. The criminal profits are estimated at EUR 1,164,000 minimum. Several charges were brought against the defendants, including: running or participating in a criminal organisation and human smuggling with aggravating circumstances, abusing the vulnerable situation of persons, the fact that one victim was a minor, the fact that the activity was a habitual activity and participating in a criminal organisation. Myria, the Belgian Federal Migration Centre,  filed a civil suit in this case. Police information revealed that the first defendant, with his brother, the fourth defendant, was clearly involved in the organised smuggling of people mainly of Syrian origin. A route from Turkey to Crete and Belgium was used. In addition, fake or forged identity papers were systematically used. It was on this basis that an investigation was carried out into money transfer companies. In the more in-depth investigation, which included searches, chat messages and communication tracking, it transpired that the first defendant received money to organise the journey to Belgium (between EUR 1,500 and EUR 4,500) and that the victims were often frightened of the defendant. During the examination of the first defendant's iPhone, numerous 'chat' messages that appeared to relate to human smuggling, as well as photos of identity papers and photos were discovered. The chat messages revealed that there were frequent requests to find a lookalike for the photos and coded language was used.The first defendant was also known to other police departments. He seemed to be in contact with people who were known for being Syrian fighters or potential Syrian fighters. This was evidently an organisation active in human smuggling. The clients were apparently recruited in Syria by the second defendant and his brother, and the third defendant operated from Belgium in the company of the first defendant. The twelfth defendant, a former girlfriend of the first defendant, stated that they frequently stayed in Crete, in the second defendant's house, and that strange things happened there. For instance, one person had used the papers of the first defendant to continue their journey and had also had to look after money for him. They also went to Paris with the first defendant, where they had transported unknown people. In the defendant's statements, it frequently appeared that they only wanted to help their friends and that they weren't paid. The investigating judge sent requests for international legal assistance to France, Greece and Sweden. The objective was to investigate a specific defendant, a safe house and interview two presumed victims.",smuggling of migrants,1
"Eleven undocumented Vietnamese migrants were smuggled to Belgium and France in exchange of 20.000 euros, to which 6.000 euros was added if the migrants wanted to reach the UK.Half of the money was paid by the migrants before the journey, and the other half was paid by their family to the condition that the migrants effectively managed to arrive to the country of destination.Migrants who wished to reach the UK were accommodated in “safe-houses” in Brussels, and were the hide inside trucks driving to Calais. Members of the organisation were located in different European countries to control smuggled migrants’ journey.This network was dismantled after French authorities in Calais found the migrants in trucks.",smuggling of migrants,1
"Before the court appeared three defendants. Those are two Belgian natural persons, a man, named in the judgment as M.V. and a woman, named C.R., as well as a legal person. The previous defendant’s owned and operated horse stable company SAP, which also functioned as a horse riding school. On appeal from a judgment of a Liège criminal court in 2016, the appeals court of Liège determined the facts of the case as follows: among the three identified employees counted two Moroccan nationals, incidentally also brothers, identified as B.S.S and B.S.Y. They were recruited to enter Belgium illegally and housed in order to work for the defendants and their legal entity. The male defendant has accepted responsibility for the hiring of the migrant worker S.B.S. and having accepted the arrival of the younger migrant worker from Morocco. Whilst it was mentioned that the migration of the two workers was a result of the efforts of their families, it is not determined within the facts of the case, whether either of the defendants were involved or otherwise participated in the facilitation of the illegal entry into Belgium. Merely in the deliberation of the charge of migrant smuggling, the level of responsibility for having employed the Moroccan brothers was attributed to the actus reus of the crime and was established as having had an alleviative effect on the economic burden of the families. Under the defendant’s employment, the migrants’ tasks generally included the upkeeping of the riding arena under supervision in addition to caring for the horses, although it was established that the younger brother, B.S.Y., and B.S.S. have shouldered different shares of tasks. The workers testified that they have received instructions on their work to be performed from the male defendant who communicated work instructions through the older brother only since the younger brother was not able to speak French sufficiently. Meanwhile, the female defendant had an overall directive function and had almost daily contact with the workers, who are found to have been in a subordinate relationship with their employers. The statements by the brothers reveal that they have been labouring at least full-time, but the legal obligations applicable under Belgian labour law, i.e., social obligations such as occupational accident insurance and social security benefits, were not complied with as there was a failure to pay social security contributions to the National Social Security Office. The female defendant, being the legal manager of the horse riding and stable company, had failed to protect the workers in guaranteeing these benefits and, thus, the lack of action is construed as a positive act of participation warranting criminal responsibility. Although attempts were made to regularize their irregular status in Belgium, no further steps were initiated to complete that process. Instead, the migrant brothers continued to work long hours for the defendants and their company in exchange for an unusually low wage. Furthermore, they were housed in poor conditions, e.g. without heating or hot water.The defendants are charged for the crime of trafficking in human beings and the crime of aggravated migrant smuggling, as the employers had recruited, accommodated and exercised authority over the migrants with allegedly the view of exploiting their precarious situation, owing to their illegal stay in Belgium and their lack of viable alternatives to leave the employment. Other charges include the failure to comply with obligations regarding the employment of foreign workers, failure to pay the correct amount of social security contributions and, lastly, the failure to pay occupational accident insurance. When the irregular status of the older brother was discovered, the younger brother went into hiding and did not immediately trust the social services (ASBL S.) responsible for protecting victims of human  trafficking.Since the situation was brought to light due to unpaid social security obligations, the social inspectorate has determined that the wages paid to the workers were not compliant with Belgian labour law. In addition, the inspectorate has passed on to the prosecution that the legal obligations connected with employing the Moroccan migrants were not appropriately observed, e.g. no occupational accident insurance was afforded to the workers. Upon approach by the social services, the younger Moroccan brother was timid and evasive owing to the fear of discovering his precarious and irregular status and had to be reassured in order for him not to be a flight risk.",trafficking in persons,1
"In this case involving a major Nigerian prostitution ring, two defendants were prosecuted for trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation and trafficking in human beings.The case started when, in January 2017, seven Nigerian girls with no right of residence were found in a café in Antwerp. In the same period, in another case, following advertisements on a website, the police went to a hotel in Ostend where they found Nigerian girls forced into prostitution.  Two victims were identified in this case, and one of them filed a civil action.The girls had been recruited in Nigeria by a friend of the first defendant and arrived in Italy via  Libya  across the Mediterranean. Driven to Belgium from Italy, they were then told that they had to repay a debt of 30,000 euros through forced prostitution. Voodoo rituals had been organised, putting pressure on the girls and their families. The first defendant occupied a higher position than the second defendant. The latter regularly received money from the girls, which she handed over to the first defendant.Both defendants were convicted for the alleged offences by the Antwerp Criminal Court on 14 August 2018. The second defendant was convicted in absentia and lodged an opposition. In the judgment handed down on opposition, the court granted her a 5-year suspension of part of her prison sentence.",trafficking in persons,1
"In this case involving a major Nigerian prostitution ring, two defendants were prosecuted for trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation and trafficking in human beings. Other members of the same network had previously been convicted in other legal proceedings for trafficking in human beings by the Criminal Court of Bruges on 20 September 2017 and the Court of Appeal of Ghent on 1 June 2018.The case started when in January 2017 seven Nigerian girls without residence rights were found in a café in Antwerp. In the same period, in another case, following advertisements on a website, the police had visited a hotel in Ostend where they found Nigerian girls forced into prostitution. Both cases had ramifications. Two victims were identified in this case, and one of them filed a civil action.The girls had been recruited in Nigeria by a friend of the first defendant and arrived in Italy via Libya across the Mediterranean. Driven to Belgium from Italy, they were then told that they had to repay a debt of 30,000 euros through forced prostitution. Voodoo rituals had been organised, putting pressure on the girls and their families. The first defendant occupied a higher position than the second defendant. The latter regularly received money from the girls, which she handed over to the first defendant. The investigation was carried out with the help of searches, a financial investigation, mobile phone and SIM card readings, analyses of the telephone traffic of the base stations, statements by victims and clients and confrontations with a selection of photos.The two defendants were convicted for the alleged offences. The first defendant was considered to be pimping young girls, including minors. She had organised at least part of their crossing from Nigeria. One of the victims had been rescued by the Italian coastguard after drifting for days. The aggravating circumstance of trafficking in human beings with endangerment of the victim's life was also retained. The second defendant offered support and assistance. According to the court, it does not matter that the defendants were initially the victims of a similar network.The defendants were sentenced to imprisonment for 6 and 3 years respectively and fines of 16,000 and 6,000 euros. Both were deprived of their civil rights for 5 years. The second defendant was sentenced in absentia and filed an objection. In the judgment rendered on opposition on 27 November 2018, the court granted her a 5-year reprieve for part of the prison sentence.A victim and the not-for-profit organisation PAG-ASA had filed a civil claim.

"The facts came to light as a result of an investigation by the local police in Ostend. The investigation (including wiretaps, observations and statements) soon revealed that the gang was organised, that different girls were forced into prostitution and that they had to hand over at least 40% of their earnings to the first defendant. Some girls were also required to hand over an additional percentage of the remaining amount to the other defendants. Some of the victims also had to pay the rent for their apartments. The defendants imposed the sexual acts the victims were to perform. One victim was even forced to have an abortion. The girls were threatened with voodoo practices (including the fact that they would remain indisposed for years if they dared to denounce the defendants).Several girls also reported that the first defendant regularly used physical violence and psychological coercion against them, ranging from beatings to attempted rape for refusing orders. The other defendants also threatened the victims in case of non-payment. Various searches have been organized, as well as the monitoring of various financial transactions and the reading of mobile phones. Extreme videos of child pornography were found on the mobile phones of several defendants. Searches were organized, as well as the monitoring of various financial transactions and the reading of mobile phones.

"Three defendants and two companies were prosecuted for various offences: trafficking of human beings for the purpose of the sexual exploitation of 22 victims, recruiting and exploitation of the prostitution of 161 prostitutes, running a brothel, pimping at hotels (this charge concerns a company). Some of them (including two other companies) were also charged with forgery of documents, money laundering, tax fraud and insurance fraud. The main defendant bought out the majority of prostitution parlours in Liège to create, as he put it, a sort of “Villa Tinto” like the one in Antwerp. In reality, he didn’t present any such concrete project. On the contrary, after the departure of the Belgian prostitutes who refused the conditions imposed by this defendant, he put to work a large number of young women of African origin with Belgian or Spanish papers. He recruited these young women in Antwerp and Brussels. When he arrived, the shifts were reduced, which allowed him to bring in another tenant; nothing was done to renovate the building despite the promises made; fake employment contracts were drawn up, etc. Supplements were regularly demanded for cleaning, for the shower, etc., even though the tenancy included these services. The companies set up were intended to conceal the profits from prostitution. His partner, the co-defendant, served as a nominee in this context. The third defendant looked after the parlours and rent collection for the main defendant.",trafficking in persons,1
"The prostitution network consisted of two Hungarian Roma families who, in an organized and violent way, forced young Roma women, including one minor, into prostitution. The victims were sexually exploited in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.Three female defendants acted as 'procurers' in the criminal system.  As intermediaries, they collected the money of the prostitution victims and did not hesitate to use violence if the victims did not yield enough money. In addition, they searched employment in the window prostitution bars for their victims and took care of their livelihood.One of the main defendants was also a drug dealer who supplied drugs to some of the co-defendants, prostitution clients and victims.The detectives screened the financial modus operandi of the prostitution network on the basis of data obtained from telephone tap, observations and money transfers. The procurers checked how much the victims 'yielded' on the basis of the condoms used. They handed the proceeds in cash over to cash couriers who brought the proceeds by car to Hungary, where they were mainly invested in real estate. In addition, the offenders also made international money transfers to Hungary in the name of the victims via the regular financial offices.The telephone tap supplied objective evidence of violence committed against the victims. Some conversations even included orders to control certain girls, and to beat and threaten them.  Furthermore, the extensive internet investigation and the telephone tap revealed that the offenders used Facebook to select the victims on the basis of their pictures and to communicate with them and with each other.Detectives conducted searches and arrested people in several countries simultaneously. In Belgium, just one search yielded 32 false passports. During a search in Hungary, evidence was found that the prostitution network also recruited girls in the United Kingdom.",trafficking in persons,1
"On the 17th of November 2010, two Bulgarian women entered a police station in Liège, and claimed that they were being forced into prostitution. The police decided to examine the mobile phone of one of the victims with her agreement, and put in place a telephone wiretapping device.The police launched an investigation, and observed the defendants, in order to check their contacts with people engaged in prostitution, to establish a potential hierarchy among the defendants, and to locate the place where the victims were being hosted.The police found that the four appellants were working in an organised manner in order to constantly monitor and control the victims, and also imposed a certain working rhythm over the girls. Moreover, one of the defendants was seen by the police while collecting money from the victims and another defendant was arrested in possession of an important sum of money.This evidence was supported by the testimonies of the victims: one of the victims stated that she had been forced to give all the money she earned to the defendant, who threatened to break her legs if she left, and forced her to work even when she was sick.Another victim reported that she had been brought to Belgium by one of the defendants, who promised that she would work as a waitress or as a housemaid. Another victim said that a defendant had hit her and threatened her in order to force her into prostitution, and had also taken her ID card.The police found during their enquiry, that three of the defendants often visited a restaurant, where one of the defendants was seen with some of the victims. The victims would come and sit at the same table as the defendant and would give him something under the table.The defendants constantly controlled and monitored the victims and their work. During their observation of the defendants and their operation, the police witnessed how one of the defendants went to talk to one of the victims while she was on the street after midnight. The defendant talked to the victim, left and returned later in the night and argued with another victim. That same defendant came back a third time to observe a third victim.On the same day, another defendant was dropped off at the same place and entered the restaurant. Another defendant joined him. One hour later one of them left the restaurant with a baton in his hand and came back one minute later. Five minutes later a third defendant arrived and joined them at their table.Thanks to the telephone tapping, the police listened to a conversation between two of the defendants on November, 7. From that conversation, it appears that three of the defendants were responsible for the surveillance of the victims. As to the role of the fourth defendant, one of the witnesses declared that he was very good friends with one of the defendants, and that he also participated watching the victims in the street. He would also regularly change his mobile phone SIM card.One of the victims stated that this fourth defendant was also exploiting prostitutes himself. Even though the trial witness did not confirm this affirmation, it is supported by a recording of a phone conversation between two other defendants on November 10.",trafficking in persons,1
"The defendant was arrested on August 25th, 2012, while he was in his car and had just picked up a person who had been begging in the car park of a supermarket. Another person was found the following day in the car park of a different supermarket, and told the police that he had been waiting for the defendant to pick him up. A third person was found the same day in the car park of another supermarket. All three victims were physically disabled and moved around in a wheelchair. None of them spoke French.The three victims reported that they were living in an institution in Slovakia, when the defendant had offered to take them to his place, pretending he was their cousin. The victims lived in one single room with other disabled people and could not access other parts of the house. The defendant had already brought the victims to Belgium to beg on several occasions. He left them in the car park of a supermarket at the opening time and came to pick them up when the store closed, 6 days a week. The defendant took all the money they collected, as well as the social benefits received by the victims in Slovakia. It appears that the victims and the defendant all slept in the car during their stay in Belgium.On the day of the arrest the police found 4 pillows, 650 €  in cash, a large quantity of coins, and French-language signs asking for money in the defendant’s car. The police investigation found that the defendant had been previously convicted in Slovakia for his involvement in similar activities, and that investigations had also been conducted in Germany and in Slovenia. It seems that the defendant was acting alone and was not part of a network.",trafficking in persons,0
"Defendant 1, a Portuguese trader; Defendant 2, a Portuguese servant; Defendant 3, a Portuguese manager; and Defendant 4, Batisoft Ltd. were charged with human trafficking under the following aggravating circumstances: the victim’s particularly vulnerable position was abused; the activity had taken place on a continuous basis; and the crime was committed in the capacity of an association between 1 August 2008 and 13 May 2009, in Brugge, Sint-Joost-Ten-Node, and elsewhere in Belgium.From the testimony of the victim and the conducted investigation, it was proven that employees at Batisoft Ltd. were not provided with safety clothes for their work. The victim also complained about excessive working hours. The victim did not have a legal permit to stay in Belgium, but was free to come and go.The Court of Appeal ruled against the Court of First Instance, and reversed the guilty verdict of the defendants.",trafficking in persons,1
"The company Carestel manages the motorway services in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. It concluded a contract with the company Kronos, based in Germany, concerning the cleaning of the toilets on the motorway rest area. Kronos is responsible for hiring and managing the employees cleaning the toilets. Several inspections led by the labour inspection services found that the people working in the toilets were working sometimes 15 hours per day, 7 days a week, and received a very small salary. The employees were all foreign nationals, with no knowledge of the Dutch language, most of them coming from eastern Europe. They had signed a contract with Kronos that they were not able to understand, most of them were not able to say whether they were working as employees or as independent workers.Kronos organised its activities so that employees were living in a house belonging to the company, someone from Kronos would drive each of the employees to a rest area in the morning and pick them up in the evening. The employees took a few cents from each client going into the toilets, and put the money in a safe. An employee from Kronos came every week or several times a week to take the money.",trafficking in persons,1
"In this case in Tongeren, a Nigerian network of traffickers in women was dismantled. The organisation also had branches in the Netherlands and in Spain and was active in large-scale money laundering activities and credit card fraud. One of the victims was a Nigerian minor.The girls were recruited in Nigeria under all sorts of pretexts and were transported illegally into Belgium via Greece in order to work as escort-girls in the prostitution world. They had to pay back the travel costs through prostitution. The defendants took advantage of voodoo rituals to instil fear in the victims. The Nigerian girls were forced to submit to extreme forms of sex on dirty mattresses and had to work day and night. There was virtually no hygiene; even the customers complained about the filthy premises and the unpleasant odours.The victims were staying irregularly in Belgium. It is precisely this precarious and dependent situation that leaves these victims no other choice than to let themselves be exploited. The statements of the victims illustrated in detail how they were manipulated, deceived and intimidated. One of the victims was physically abused and locked in a room when the defendants discovered that she had withheld part of the money earned from the customers. When she refused to spontaneously hand over the money, the defendant struck her in order to try to take the money from her hands. He locked her up in the room where she was then staying and took away her telephone to prevent her from communicating with the outside world. He would return later, after work, to sort things out. In the meantime the victim was able to escape with the help of the neighbour.",trafficking in persons,1
"In this case, the manager of a Belgian-Moroccan bar, a former prostitute, sexually exploited several young Moroccan and Brazilian women, one of whom was a minor, in a prostitution bar, in the judicial district of Dendermonde, between 2006 and 2009.The victims were gradually forced into prostitution. In the majority of cases, they were offered employment in Morocco as domestic help or in a restaurant. Girls who were residing irregularly in Belgium or who had had extensive difficulty finding employment also received proposals of this type. Most of the victims were unaware that it was prostitution that they were being recruited for and expected to arrive at a restaurant. Once they had arrived at the bar, the manager gradually pushed the boundaries of the victims with drinks and drugs. She told them that prostitution would solve all of their financial and residency problems. In order to obtain residency papers, they had to enter into a marriage of convenience, for which they had to pay through prostitution. Many victims agreed to this proposal.The defendant showed a clear preference for victims staying in the country irregularly. The majority of the victims – Moroccans and Brazilian – were staying irregularly in the country and the defendant used fraud with regard to several of them: one of them was promised a job as a housekeeper, another one believed she would be working in a restaurant and a third, in a café.The health conditions inside the bar were also very bad: the toilets and showers did not work and the young women were housed in deplorable conditions: the housing inspection declared the rooms uninhabitable.In case of conflict with the victims, the defendant threatened to call some Albanian friends. One of the Brazilian victims confirmed that the manager did call a Moroccan friend after an argument and that this friend came to the prostitution bar and violently threatened anyone who dared to contradict the defendant.Various investigative measures were taken in this case, such as wiretapping and questioning customers. The financial investigation showed that the amount of electronic banking transactions reached 304,611 euros, 290,903.50 euros of which the defendant had transferred to her personal bank account. Based on the calculation of the assets of criminal origin, confiscation of 2.5 million euros was requested during the trial.",trafficking in persons,1

The group carried out these acts under the guise of “Serbaz Project and Construction Ltd.” (Serbaz), which was a branch of the company “Akora Business Ltd.” registered in a British oversees territory. As Serbaz was registered in Azerbaijan, it entered into contracts with the Ministry of Youth and Sports of Azerbaijan.

Finally, D.D.M. was able to escape this exploitative situation thanks to the assistance provided by residents of Neuquén, which allowed her to denounce the situation before the Fedetal Prosecutor.Similarly, the Court considered that it had been fully proven by the many testimonies received during the course of the trial, as well as by the body of evidence incorporated, that D.M.J.T. and J.C.Z. had been recruited and transported from the Dominican Republic to Mar del Plata. The victims were lured with a sham job offer and deceived through the abuse of their position of vulnerability. The victims were harboured in the dwelling located in Sal Salvador Street in Mar del plata. The defendants used coercive mechanisms, including penalties or fines, as well as the fabrication of financial debts, with the purpose of submitting them to sexual exploitation. This situation continued at least from the 28-06-2008, until the  19-04-2010, when the federal local law enforcement forces carried out a raid on the premises. On that occasion, law enforcement were able to verify the presence of several citizens from Dominican Republic – M.M.S., Y.A.A., S.U.R., and J.I.E.U. inside the establishment. These women were living in appalling sanitation and overcrowding conditions, and were also being subjected to exploitation.The investigation regarding these acts initiated as a response to the complaint filed by D.M.J.T. before the Human Trafficking Delegation of the Federal Police on the 11th of March of 2010, after managing to escape with the help of a third person, and running  away to the city of Buenos Aires.The victim reported that she had been recruited in the Dominican Republic together with nine other women, by a man named “T.”, who offered her the possibility of travelling to Spain, with the promise of obtaining a visa for her. The victim gave this man the deed to her house in the Dominican Republic, as a collateral to guarantee the payment for the travel arrangements. However, once the victim arrived at the airport of Santo Domingo to travel to Spain, this man told them that they would have to pass through Argentina first, as the visas were more easily obtained in Argentina. Once in Argentina, the victims were received and transported by a man called “J.”, and stayed at his personal domicile for ten days. She was then transported to a nightclub called “D.”. Once at “D.”, J. brought a few suitcases filled with underwear and lingerie, and told the women that there had been complications with the processing of the visas, and that they would have to work at the bar and prostitute theselves. He threatened the victims and told them that if they didn’t comply, they would lose their houses in the Dominican Republic.From that moment onwards, the victims were entrapped in the nightlub, and they were not allowed to leave the premises under any circumstances. The victims were forced to engage in prostitution and to live in the same rooms in which they provided sexual services. In her testimony, D.M.J.T. mentioned a man called “F.”, who was J.’s son, and was the person in charge of the club. “F.” was responsible of charging customers for the sexual services performed and for the drinks consumed. He also fined the women and imposed penalties if a client complained for any reason, and charged the victims 400 pesos to pay off the police, and 300 pesos to pay for food and other expenses. The victim never received any money, because according to J., she had to repay the debt generated by her travel arrangements, to pay for the costs of her stay at the nightclub, and for the promised trip to Spain. After being in this situation for three months, the victim was able to escape with the help of a customer.As to J.C.Z., she was recruited by her aunt, O.V.M. and her husband, J.S in June of 2008, with the promise of a job at O.V.M.’s beauty salon. However, upon arrival to Argentina, she found out the real nature of the activity she would be subjected to. J.C.Z. recounted the psychological abuse she suffered, as well as the coactive environment in which they lived, subject to constant violent threats, and even death threats. She also explained that the defendants simulated a supportive and prosperous environment, and forced the victims to record videos sending regards to their families, and to have their pictures taken at O.V.M.’s beauty salon, to convince their families that they were happy and working at that place.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence

"SummaryHarmony Gold Mine (Pty) Limited is a mining company operating the Masimong Gold Mine in the district of Henneman in South Africa. Miners can legally enter the shafts if they are able to produce a mining identity card used to clock-in and out when entering and exiting the mine. Notwithstanding, it was common knowledge that the clocking system could be breached allowing illegal miners to enter the mine. Illegal mining operations inside the mine were a known phenomenon and illegal processing or refinery plants were found and subsequently destroyed in the past.From 10-11 April 2014, an underground “clean-up” operation to expose illegal miners was carried out by a security agency. During the operation, makeshift gold processing plants, beds, letters, books, name lists and other documents were discovered, together with large quantities of extracted ore. The documents included gold transaction notes and photographs, pointing towards the identities of the illegal miners.The investigation brought to light that ore worth ZAR 125 million were extracted using processing plants. Yet, on site, investigators only discovered material worth ZAR 41 million (1211 tons of ore) that were moved and made ready for further transports using canvas bags.Though no one was arrested during the two-day operations, 22 people were found and arrested between 16 April and 14 July 2014, mostly while being on the mine’s premises. One person was arrested outside the premises, incriminated by document evidence encountered on site.The group of arrested consisted of nationals from Mozambique and Zimbabwe between 20 and 43 years old and were found to have a varying degree of involvement in the illegal enterprise. Lovemore Chaba Mlambo was identified as orchestrating the illegal operations.They were found guilty of racketeering, money laundering, as well as contravention of the Precious Metals Act and the Criminal Procedure Act. On 14 March 2017, the Virginia Circuit Court sentenced them to prison sentences ranging from 3 to 20 years.They appealed the judgment in front of the High Court of South Africa, Free State Division (Bloemfontein) but saw their appeal rejected on 22 March 2019.Details on the appealThe appellants argued that they had not been caught conducting any illegal mining operations. The respondent countered that the essential ingredient for the criminal racketeering activity is the conspiracy to commit an organized criminal offence or to participate in an unlawful enterprise. Hence, the appellants could be prosecuted on racketeering charges even though they were not caught red-handed. The court found that an implicit agreement among the appellants was manifested in the construction of the illegal refinery plants and the fact that ore had been extracted already, which in itself is a laborious effort requiring collaboration. Furthermore, the names of some illegal miners were found in documentation seized on site. Following a similar line of argumentation, the court rejected the challenge of an established common purpose and enterprise-like organization of the appellants.Moreover, the appellants argued that while ore valued up to ZAR 125 million were extracted, only ZAR 41 million (1211 tons) worth of ore were found on site, implying that the lion share of gold could still be somewhere in the mine. Therefore, the mine operator would not have lost that ore. The court denied this argument of appeal based on the fact that the ore encountered had already been extracted and prepared for future transport which, in turn, showed that the group was capable of removing extracted ore from the mining premises. Furthermore, the court argued that the extracted but not encountered ore would amount to a quantity of 2481 tons, making it significant enough to not be overlooked and hence, unlikely to still reside within the premises of the mine. Paperwork seized on the illegal mining site further documented that extracted ore had previously been sold to an outside buyer.Also, the appellants argued that the identity of the perpetrators was not reasonably established beyond doubt.  This is because none of the appellants was found either near the shaft nor mining nor being in possession of gold ore. The respondent argued that the appellants were arrested by staff of the mine security at the surface as they stepped out of the elevator leading down to the mine. None of them was able to identify themselves with a valid mine identity card, yet many of them were in possession of mining equipment such as safety heads, protectors and cap lamps. Hence, the court found it unlikely that any of the arrested coming out of the shaft had any other business in mind than participating in the ongoing illegal mining operation.Consequently, the appeal was rejected.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"SummaryThe three defendants were found guilty on multiple counts relating to running an illegal enterprise which illegally harvested and exported abalones. In March 2019, they were sentenced to 15-18 years imprisonment.Illegal harvesting and trading of abalone have been a reason for concern in South Africa’s Eastern Cape since the 1990s. The seaside city Port Elizabeth is considered a hub for the illegal trade in abalone and has been declared to be a hotspot of criminal enterprises and kingpins. The numbers of abalone, which is mostly sold as delicacy to Asia, has been in decline, sparking the government to respond to the issue by establishing dedicated teams seeding abalone and patrolling the area.Details On 22 March 2015, a member of the South African Police Service observed suspicious activities while being on patrol along the coast heading towards Noordhoek. He observed individuals coming out of the water loading backs onto vehicles. He chased the vehicles and was able to arrest one suspect after a hot pursuit, encountering abalone on the suspect’s car. Another suspect working for the defendants was found in possession of abalone without a permit a month later. The South African Police Service launched an investigation into the operation of the defendants.The lead investigator described the illegal operations of the defendants as syndicate-like. While their enterprise relied on the support of several people, the defendants conducted their operations on a need-to-know basis, in which different participants in the supply chain would have limited knowledge about the overall operation. Abalones are being harvested by divers using diving equipment provided for by the accused. The harvested abalones would be packed and marked with an identification mark of the respective harvester. From there, the abalones would be loaded onto motor vehicles, from where a driver would take them to the “weight house”. In that station, the abalones would be sorted by size, had their shell removed and weighted. Based on their weight, the divers would be paid. Another driver would then take the abalones to another location where they would be stored in freezers. Yet another person would later pick them up to transport them to the processing plant, where the abalones get cleaned and cooked. Via the cities of Gauteng or Cape Town, the abalones would ultimately be shipped to China and sold as delicacy.",trafficking in firearms,Sentenced
"Johannes Erasmus van Staden was a Cape Town businessman and registered representative vendor of Indo Atlantic Seafoods (Pty) Limited, Indo Atlantic Shipping limited and Southern Ocean Marine Corporation (Pty) Limited. From 2005 to 2008, he engaged in an illegal scheme through which he defrauded the South African Revenue Service (SARS). His modus operandi included falsely presenting invoices and inflated fish export records to the SARS, which in return refunded VAT to Mr. van Staden’s company. Over the course of time, Mr. van Staden defrauded taxes of more than R250 million. In June 2016, he was found guilt on 43 charges of racketeering, fraud, reckless conduct of business, and contravention of the Prevention of Organized Crime Act, such as money laundering. Mr. Staden was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and had R6 million worth of assets confiscated.During 2005 and 2008, Mr. van Staden submitted false records about alleged fish exports to the SARS, indicating much higher amounts of fish exports than accurate. Furthermore, he submitted alleged expenditures of his business, such as expenditures for refrigerator systems, delivery trucks, and fish production lines. He obtained authentic invoices for these expenditures by requesting quotes from different providers in the fisheries industry. He repeatedly accepted offers and asked for invoices, which he claimed were for financial purposes. Upon reception of these invoices, he submitted them to the SARS but walked away from the deals. Through this, Mr. van Staden not only defrauded money from the SARS but also inflicted significant economic damage on third-party service providers.In early 2005, Mr. van Staden approached S&D Consulting to function as bookkeeper and accountant to the Indo Atlantic group on a commission basis. Later that year, the First National Bank closed the account of Indo Atlantic Seafoods (Pty) Limited, upon which S&D Consulting started to receive their financial transactions instead. After deducting their commission and fee, SD Consulting forwarded the money to Indo Atlantic companies. Mr. van Staden lived a lavish lifestyle with that money, funnelling it through a family trust called Swordfish Trust. Through this, he financed his luxury expenses, including the purchase of a game farm, an airplane, different motor vehicles, an apartment for his daughter, and a family vacation with chartered jet.The initial indictment was directed at Mr. van Staden and five other potential perpetrators. In June 2016, Mr. van Staden was found guilty on 43 out of 184 counts, whereas the other accused were found not guilty on all charges. Mr. Staden was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and had R6 million worth of assets confiscated.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"Juan Hattingh was a young practicing attorney and conveyancer with a portfolio of high profile clients that included four important South African banks, namely, ABSA, Standard Bank, First National Bank, and Nedbank. Apart from his firm, Hattingh Attorneys, of which he was the sole proprietor, he also held interests in other local firms of attorneys. As his practice flourished, he ventured into other enterprises such as property development and construction. In 2011, he pleaded guilty to a sophisticated scheme of fraud, theft, and money laundering in which he utilized his professional attorney’s trust account for criminal purposes. The scheme included the registration of properties acquired by Hattingh under the names of friends and relatives, double-bonded properties, and the use of his trust account as a deposit for the stolen funds. “In other words, he had operated his trust account as a vehicle through which to launder the proceeds of his unlawful activities.” (Hamman & Koen, 2012). Hattingh was convicted of 64 counts of fraud, one count of theft and one count of money laundering. He received an effective term of 20 years' imprisonment for the charges of fraud and theft, and a suspended sentence of 8 years' imprisonment for the charge of money laundering. Additionally, the Law Society successfully applied to have his name struck off the roll of practicing attorneys.On appeal against the sentences imposed on him in respect of the fraud charges, he contended that the trial court had sentenced him beyond the scope of his guilty plea and had overlooked mitigating factors. The Supreme Court of Appeal agreed with him and reduced his sentence to 12 years' imprisonment for the charge of fraud.",drug offences,Sentenced
"In November 2010, under the authority of the South African National Director of Public Prosecution, Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited entered into an agreement whereby it pleaded guilty to 102 counts related to charges stemming from having allowed its ‘employees and facilities to be used to conduct … illegal kidney transplant operations’. In addition to Netcare, a number of other charges were laid against the St Augustine's Hospital, located in Durban, South Africa, the CEO of Netcare, Richard Friedland, and eight others: four transplant doctors, a nephrologist, two transplant administrative coordinators, and an interpreter. The admission of guilt related to 109 illegal kidney transplant operations that took place between June 2001 and November 2003. The scheme involved Israeli citizens in need of kidney transplants who would be brought to South Africa for transplants performed at St Augustine's Hospital.While the kidneys supplied originally came from Israeli citizens, ‘later Romanian and Brazilian citizens were recruited as their kidneys were obtainable at a much lower cost’. The broker, Ilan Perry, was the individual who was in charge of the recruitment of both kidney suppliers and recipients and was not South African and has not been charged. He set a fee of between USD 100,000 and USD 120,000 for recipients and paid the original suppliers of kidneys USD 20,000. However, later on in the scheme, Romanians and Brazilians received on average of USD 6,000.Ilan Perry used recruiters to source individuals ready to supply kidneys; two of these, Captain Ivan Da Silva and Gaby Tauber, had been imprisoned in Brazil for their roles in the affair. Blood screening of prospective kidney suppliers was done in-country and again in South Africa in an attempt to ‘ensure sufficient compatibility with prospective recipients’; those deemed suitable were ‘accommodated and chaperoned’ and ‘given documents to sign falsely indicating that they were related to each other’. This fraudulent activity was meant to circumvent the requirement to gain outside approval, via a Ministerial Committee, for transplants of unrelated principals. While Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited was paid up-front for its participation in the illegal kidney transplants, the people supplying the healthy kidneys were paid after the fact and in cash.The charges to which Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited pleaded guilty were laid under the South African Human Tissue Act 1983 and the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 1998. It might be mentioned that the company escaped charges which had been leveled at the other accused, including fraud, forgery, and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm (for operations without informed consent). The Human Tissue Act 1983 prohibited the transplantation of the tissue of minors into another living person; requiring that written consent be provided; and that no purchase of tissue, such as kidneys, was allowed. Further, there existed a Ministerial Policy of the Department of Health which set out, inter alia, that:“Donor organs must be used primarily for South African citizens and permanent residents. Written consent must be obtained from the Minister of Health before any person who is not a South African citizen or permanent resident is accepted onto a transplantation programme.”The Ministerial policy also established that a Ministerial Committee had to approve applications for transplantation of unrelated living donors so as ‘to reduce the possibility of abuse’.The prosecutor later argued that the company and the other accused must have been aware of the law and policy regarding transplants from living donors, and that they had to try to find a way to portray ostensible compliance with the current policy and legislation. They therefore created the pretence that the kidney suppliers were related to the recipients.The first charge--counts 1 to 5--to which Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited pleaded guilty related to the use of five minors as organ suppliers in violation of the Human Tissue Act 1983. The employees of St Augustine's Hospital were recognised, in the convoluted Charge Sheet of the Prosecutor, to be ‘acting on behalf of the accused company and were about the exercised of their powers and the performance of their duties as employees of the company furthering or endeavouring to further the interests of the company’, in carrying out these illegal kidney transplants. Counts 6 to 10 constituted the second charge and related to receiving payment for the kidney transplants emanating from the five minors. It might be mentioned that Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited received payments from the broker and it then disbursed payment ‘to the other accused and service providers; including the surgeons for their services’. The third charge, consisting of counts 11 through 102, related to contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 1998. In regard to the 102 transplant operations that did not include minors, the company pleaded guilty to its employees having received money, the proceeds of an unlawful activity; while Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited admitted that ‘in the circumstances’, it knew ‘that the aforementioned property formed part of the proceeds of unlawful activities’.In the Agreement between Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited and the State, the State recognised its own legitimate interest ‘in overseeing the control over transplant of human tissues […] the interests of the medical profession and the public at large’. Where the public interest was concerned, the Agreement noted:“that a company, such as the accused company, guilty of an offence such as this, should be convicted and punished and more particularly, that that conviction and punishment should take place in open court for society as a whole to come to know and understand that the prosecuting authorities and the Department of Health will not tolerate breaches of the code of conduct and standards of ethics and compliance with the law required in a civilised society.”The Agreement then set out the penalty imposed: a confiscation order of ZAR 3,800,000 (approximately USD 466,839) amounting to the benefit the company derived from the offences, plus a sentence of ZAR 4,020,000 (approximately USD 493,875) amounting to fines for each of the counts to which Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited pleaded guilty.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"The organized criminal group is highly organised and operates transnationally. They are commonly known in South Africa as the “Mountain Boys”.The syndicate engaged in a range of criminal activities that constitute serious offences under South African law. The offences relate to racketeering activities and related categories of offences including money-laundering offences. The information gathered further indicates that in addition thereto these entities and persons have through their criminal activities committed a range of further serious offences including theft, fraud as well as offences under the provisions of the South African Mining Rights Act as well as the Precious Metals Act. There are five clearly distinguishable levels of activities used by the syndicate to smuggle unwrought precious metals (PGMs). This is illustrated as follows:As a starting point, PGMs are stolen at source from the mines, often in large quantities. These PGMs are eventually sold through various receivers to exporters.The various levels of the criminal operators in the illicit PGM industry can be explained as follows:Level 1 “the runners”The unwrought PGM’s are stolen from the processing plants in South African Mines and is commonly referred to as “theft at the source”. A runner, who is mostly an employee of the mine, will then transport the material from the mine by bag or by other methods and sell it to a middleman. Runners tend to have a wide network of black market contacts, including illicit smelters.Level 2 “the middleman”The middleman buys considerable volumes of PGMs from the runners. The middleman crushes the PGMs into smaller pieces and packages it for the national buyers, before delivery.Level 3 “national buyers”The national buyers are mostly based in the RSA and they buy the PGM’S from the level 1 and 2’s. These buyers appear to be the link between the runners and more sophisticated syndicates who constitute the next level in the hierarchy of the criminal operators. These buyers are often the agents of the more sophisticated syndicate or they operate as independent couriers for such syndicates. Their task is to buy and transport the material from the middleman to wealthy local syndicate leaders.Level 4 “the local syndicate leader”The syndicate leader / buyer use a fronting company, usually a Scrap Metal dealer to export the product from the RSA. The PGM stocks that they have purchased from various sources are processed, containerised or packaged and then sold to local or international contacts. Processing allows for detailed records to be kept by the syndicate leaders from whom the product is bought and samples are also takenfor analysis (assay) to determine value and PGM content. Storage bags/drums are weighed, marked and sealed. Smaller high value PGM parcels are exported using a courier network and bulk tonnage of PGM is containerised and either flown or shipped from the RSA. Misrepresentations are made to customs by undervaluing and falsifying the nature of the consignment. This then successfully overcomes the requirements for prescribed permits and licences to possess transport and deal in the product as required by the Act.Level 5 “the international buyers”The international contacts are situated abroad. The international market for unwrought PGM’s appears to be more attractive than the South African market as it is unregulated. Sophisticated networks, consisting of legal persons and entities register to deal in PGMs have been established abroad to deal with the imports and proceeds derived from the sale after being sold to the refiners in Western Europe, United Kingdom and Canada, capable of refining the product for commercial use. It appears that the ultimate destination is inevitably a buyer abroad rather than someone in South Africa.Note: The current syndicate under discussion were classified as level 3 to 5 operators.Legal entities involved in the case:1. Group members and others employed by or associated with the group, procured unwrought precious metals (PGMs), comprising platinum in the main from mines in South Africa, especially the Rustenburg area, where after samples thereof would be assayed by legal entities and/or persons to determine content and value, where after it would be exported to Just Refiners and Technology, UK or to a company styled as an international freight forwarding company, based in Felixstowe, Suffolk, United Kingdom, Canada and elsewhere.2. Before being dispatched by front companies especially used as part of the concealment of the illicit PGMs, the PGMs would be stored and packed into containers for export purposes in various warehouses in and around Johannesburg. If of large quantity it would then be shipped from Durban and if of smaller quantity from Johannesburg airport.3. Before being shipped, documentation for export purposes containing false information regarding content, value and/or exporter would be prepared and presented to the authorities.4. With reference to certain of the charges, Boekhoud would cause the unwrought precious metals to be assayed upon receipt in the United Kingdom at a company based in Sheffield, United Kingdom, and then upon receipt of the correct values of the product prepare or cause to be prepared so – called self – billing invoices and inform the exporters of the true value and content. Boekhoud, would then, having been provided with banking details by V Naidoo or Hoosan, remit the proceeds of sales to accounts as directed.When acting as they did the accused acted with a common purpose to commit the offences charged with.5. The Accused and others were a group of individuals associated in fact with one another for purposes of obtaining monetary benefits by means of engaging in illegal procurement and smuggling of unwrought precious metals, and, as such, their association in fact constituted an enterprise as defined in section 1(1) (v) of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, 121 of 1998.6. V Naidoo was the leader of the group. He was actively involved in the procurement and dispatch phases of unwrought precious metals and directing where proceeds from sales were to be remitted to.7. Boekhoud was a director and shareholder of a company styled Just Refiners & Technology Ltd, based in Ramsey, Huntingdon in the United Kingdom (“JRT, UK”). JRT, UK received, refined and disposed of the unwrought precious metals at a profit on behalf of the group. Boekhoud was a member of or associated with the group until the end of 2001.8. R Naidoo, a younger brother of V Naidoo, assisted in the procurement of unwrought precious metals and in storing such before being exported to the United Kingdom, Canada or elsewhere.9. R Moonian assisted in the procurement and storing of unwrought precious metals before disposal.10. Longhow collected and caused to be sampled unwrought precious metals on behalf of the enterprise during the period 2000 to 2001, where after he left the group with Kevin Naidoo (the younger brother of V Naidoo and R Naidoo) and formed a new group involved in the same activities.11. Y Chetty collected and caused to be sampled unwrought precious metals on behalf of the group.12. Hoosan procured unwrought precious metals on behalf of the group. He also, on occasion, directly or indirectly, informed accused 1 as to where the proceeds of sales of unwrought precious metals were to be remitted into international bank accounts and also assisted the syndicate to trade with the proceeds of crime in exchange for South African currency (using a havala type informal banking scheme)13. James procured PGMs and was the accountant for his brother in law, Boekhoud and JRT.14. There were also other individuals employed by or associated with the group from time to time, who assisted in the procurement, transportation or disposal of unwrought precious metals.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"OverviewIn June 2016, inside the Makana Resort in Grahamstown South Africa, three men were arrested by the South African Police Service (SAPS) as part of a wider police operation called Full Moon. The three accused were caught red-handed, carrying a freshly removed 10.7kg rhino horn, a tranquilizer dart gun including darts and tranquilizers, a bow saw, ammunition, knives, side cutters, a cordless drill, and several phones and sim cards.The investigation of the case could link the accused to 13 separate incidents of alleged rhino poaching which took place between 2013 and 2016. In April 2019, all three accused were found guilty on 50 counts and sentenced to 25 years in prison each.DetailsIn June 2016 the white rhino Cambell was killed and his horn was taken at a farm in the district of Albany, South Africa. A post-mortem examination into the death of Cambell was initiated. The bull was lying in a large pool of blood with blood tainted foam located on its right side with the front horn missing. The sinuses and airways were exposed when the horn was removed, which was done using a sharp serrated blade. From the injuries it became apparent that the rhino was still alive during the procedure. Furthermore, the examination concluded that in the absence of a bullet entry into the rhino’s body, it had been immobilized by the use of a highly potent drug. The death of the animal was caused by the damage to tissues and blood vessels, the resulting blood loss along with the amount of pain.As part of the operation Full Moon, an operation named after the fact that many rhino killings take place during periods of full moon, the South African Police Service (SAPS) arrested three men in the night of 17 June 2016. The three accused Jabulani John Ndlovu (accused 1), Forget Ndlovu (accused 2) and Sibusiso Sani Ndlovu (accused 3) were arrested in Grahamstown, South Africa. At the time of their arrest, several items used for rhino poaching operations were found in their chalet, including a freshly removed rhino horn and a saw (see full list below).Further investigations found that the freshly harvested horn belonged to the white rhino Cambell. DNA material of the horn was also found on the saw seized during the arrest. During the course of the investigation, the poaching of Cambell was linked to nine other rhino killings which took place between 2013 and 2016 in several districts in South Africa. The post-mortem examinations of all crime scenes concluded the same modus operandi had been used for the killing and harvesting of the rhinos and their horns. In particular, the modus operandi encompassed: the incidents took place during the period of the full moon; tracks of two persons were found at each crime scene; dart guns and a specific dart (Pnew dart) were used; all rhinos were tranquilized using Etorphine and/or Thiafentanil; and the horns were removed in a specific manner with a saw. In some instances, the rhinos were heavily pregnant, in which cases the sub-adults’ horns had been removed in the same way as their mothers’. Moreover, cell phone data of the accused phones showed that the phones were used in timely and spatial proximity to the previous poaching incidents.The accused were charged with ten separate incidents of alleged rhino poaching, including 50 counts related to these. In March 2019, the accused were found guilty on ten counts of theft; ten counts of carrying out a restricted activity involving a specimen of a protected species without a permit; ten counts of illegal hunting; ten counts of the possession of a scheduled substance; ten counts of unlawful possession of ammunition. Furthermore, 15 other counts on three separate poaching incidents that were initially on the charge sheet were separated and bound for another trial.One month later, on 3 April 2019, the High Court of South Africa sentenced each of the accused to 25 years imprisonment.",drug offences,Not Sentence
"According to her statements, V1 was probably 26 years old when her exposure to drugs began. In her childhood, she was molested by someone close to her family. This had a great impact on her life as an adult person. She felt unloved and dirty. To cope she took her mother’s prescription medicine, anti-depressants and sleeping tablets. Her first marriage was abusive, and she divorced her husband whilst expecting her first child. By this time, she was a full corporal working as a chef at the air force base. She turned to alcohol and stated that she was becoming an alcoholic. Her friendship with a certain sergeant, a male work colleague lead to her introduction to the sordid world of hard drugs. The sergeant took her to a Nigerian dealer in Sunnyside, Pretoria. He taught her how the drug, which she came to know as ‘rocks’ was smoked using a glass pipe. She enjoyed the experience of drug-induced happiness and over time, her cravings grew. From once a month to once a week, they made more frequent trips to Sunnyside to obtain drugs. Eventually she found herself smoking drugs every other day. Her salary of R4700.00 could not fund her addiction and she borrowed money and began selling her household goods. The sergeant suggested that if she agreed to have sex with the dealer they would get a free supply of drugs. This exchange of sex for drugs extended to other Nigerian dealers as well. Eventually she began going out on her own to obtain drugs.It was during one such outing that she was taken in by a certain Nigerian dealer when she found herself stranded at night as her motor bike needed repairs. Under the guise of offering to help her, she was taken to his flat and given more drugs. From then onwards she never returned home permanently. Because she was absent without leave, she lost her job. She went on to recount a detailed train of events, which eventually resulted in her being taken in by the accused. The details are omitted only to the extent that bear light on her transformation from drug addict to becoming a fully-fledged sex slave. The person who assisted her with her motor bike had other girls living in his flat. She was given clothes and taught how to work the streets as a prostitute. Her every movement was monitored and all income she made was taken from her. Depending on how much money she made she received rocks in exchange.She was sold to another Nigerian dealer known as Omeka who took her off the streets and advertised her body on the internet. She was photographed, and advertisements were placed offering her sexual services. She stayed here for several months and made a lot of money for the dealer.  When she managed to return to Sunnyside she met a Nigerian who she referred to as ‘Uncle’. He supplied her with rocks in exchange for her working for him as a prostitute. She thereafter was passed on and worked for another Nigerian called John during which time she realised she was pregnant. She was not allowed to leave the house and did not have many clients. Because she was not making any money John sold her to the accused.She occupied the accused’s 2-bedroom flat with a Coloured woman and a Nigerian man. She shared one room with the accused and the other couple the other. She had sexual intercourse with the accused to obtain drugs. The pattern of her lifestyle was the same – her body was advertised in provocative poses on the internet after being photographed in skimpy underwear. Men would make appointments for sex after viewing the site. Advertisements were placed on sites such as Sex Trader, Escort South Africa and Red Velvet. She had no choice in the matter. The men would call at the flat where the sexual encounters took place. Her other chores included cleaning the flat and making food. Initially she remained locked in with the Nigerian keeping guard over them. The accused collected her earnings in the evenings when he returned. In exchange, he gave her rocks for half the value of the money earned. She was unable to say whether he had any other source of income. The accused became angry if she did not see clients and bring in money. She saw 4 to 5 clients a day at a rate of R400.00 for half an hour and R500.00 for an hour. Her sole motivation to see clients was to make money for the accused to obtain drugs and sustain her addiction. Her morning drug doze, which she called the ‘wake up’ drug, was provided free by the accused and so was the evening drug, which she referred to as the ‘sleeper’.She believed that the accused was her pimp. All money earned was collected by the accused who gave her drugs in exchange. She stated that the accused used her earnings to pay the rent, buy food, toiletries and clothes for her, as she had to look good for the clients. The accused kept the rest of the money for himself.  There was a time on her birthday that the accused took her to a shopping centre to see her parents for about 15 minutes whilst keeping her under observation all the time. She did not disclose that she was being kept against her will by the accused. They lived in Faerie Glen at that time. Because she was given a cell phone so that clients could contact her, she was able to contact the Welfare regarding the birth of her child. In the accused’s absence, she left to stay at this welfare home for a week where her child was born. She stated that for a while she overcame the cravings to take any drugs, as having the child was more important to her. She decided against putting the child up for adoption and returned to live with her parents. She was even able to find work as a receptionist for a month or two. However, her addiction overcame her and on a trip one evening to buy drugs, the accused traced her and forcefully took her to Silverton. She began living there with the accused and a certain KC, who was also Nigerian. The accused again arranged for her to see clients after she was advertised on the sex website. KC manufactured drugs in the kitchen and sold it to the accused. She estimated that she made approximately R40 000.0 a month and all of this went to the accused. Her movements were severely restricted, and she was effectively locked up in the building. The accused threatened to kill her if she tried to run away again. Thereafter they moved to a flat in Silversands.V1 narrated an incident about an assault when the accused followed her to a flat where she was severely beaten. He hit her using his fists and open hands, kicked her on her ribs, beat her with a dog chain and stick all over her body. She was no longer on speaking terms with her parents who blamed her for leaving her children. In her loneliness, she explained that she turned to making the accused’s life happy so that her life could be happy. There were many instances when he assaulted her and punished her by not giving her drugs. He manipulated her emotionally and made her believe that she was worthless. When they moved to Loskop Street, she was able to escape in the boot of the car of the client of another girl. She returned to her parent’s home and stayed there for a long time. Her third daughter was born during this time. She reverted to using drugs again. The accused came across her one evening when she went to buy drugs and took her back with him. She had earlier incurred a drug debt with a certain Nigerian dealer called JJ who held her motor bike as security for payment. The accused made this payment of R2000.00 on her behalf after she was escorted by force to his car. The arrangements were that she would live with a certain Chooks for a while and that her bike would be collected later.During her stay with Chooks, she reverted to prostitution through the internet and received her daily supply of drugs. Chooks became her new pimp for a while, although she later found out that the money was shared with the accused. The accused got to know that Chooks made a lot of money from the clients which she picked up from a local bar and took her away to live in Elarduspark, which was the home of a certain Cheedi, a person the accused worked for when he arrived in South Africa. They rented a room there. There were other prostitutes in the house. Because the accused failed to pay the rent, they left to live in a flat in Sunnyside. A certain Charles owned this flat and 4 or 5 other prostitutes occupied it. The ladies worked the streets for clients. The accused kept guard over V1, who worked on the internet and the streets.Eventually, they moved to Sandalwood Road, Newlands. She and the accused occupied the bottom level. This was the address where the accused was arrested. This was also the address where the 2nd complainant V2 came to live a few months later. V2 was an 18-year-old drug addict recruited by Chooks for which he also got a share of her earnings as a prostitute. She believed that the accused had sex with V2 the evening she arrived because she came across a condom.  She had no knowledge of any rape. The accused continued to make more money with two girls working. They saw more clients here and made more money all of which the accused controlled. The girls were advertised in newspapers and the internet. All sexual activities took place in exchange for drugs supplied by the accused at this venue rented by the accused. When the clients called at the premises, the accused would lurk in the background so that he was not seen but he always was informed what was going on. The witness was shown a bundle of cell phone records, but she was unable to confirm that any of the names appearing therein were used by her or related to her.She contacted her parents through Facebook and arranged to go to the Children’s Court in Pretoria North to sign off her last born so that her parents would become legal guardians of her child. It was before magistrate Hitchcock that she made a full disclosure which caused the magistrate to report the matter to the Hawks. V1 accompanied the officers to point out the premises where the accused was arrested. She was thereafter in protective custody.Under cross examination she denied that the accused was the father of her second born child. She conceded that the only reason she continued to stay on with the drug dealers was because of her drug addiction and she believed that she was acting out of her own free will at the time. She denied that her working as a prostitute was due to an arrangement she had with the accused. It was put to her that she was not forced to see clients and she only did so get money for her addiction. She denied this. She clarified that her wake up and sleeper drugs were given to her by the accused free of charge. However, if she did not see clients she was not given food, and something was taken away from her as punishment. She further conceded that although opportunities presented itself for her to run away from the accused, the accused made threats to kill her family if she ever tried to run away and he had her motor cycle.There was a time when her father reported her missing to the police. She was questioned about a police raid, which took place whilst living in Elarduspark, which created an opportunity for her to make a report to the police. She affirmed that she did so, but they returned her to the accused. This made her lose all faith and hope in their ability to help her. The accused maintained that after she left, it was she who contacted him to settle her debts, which he did to stop her working on the streets. She denied this and maintained that it created a further obligation to advertise her on the internet and force her to offer her sexual services over a long time.Statements of V2According to her statements, V2 was 6 months old when she, together with her sisters and brother were placed in the welfare social system. This happened after she was raped by her father. Her mother became a prostitute. She was then moved to another home, which separated her from her siblings. From there she was placed in the Morester Children’s Home until she was 12 years old.  She was thereafter transferred to the Catherine Robinson Children’s Home in Vereeniging. Here she was subjected to bullying and mockery which resulted in her getting into fights with other learners. At the Home she associated with a group of girls she described as ‘wrong friends’. One in the group introduced the rest to start smoking dagga. They absconded from school for 3 months to live with a certain Aunty Baby who owned a pub. Their intention was to go on a drinking spree. She made acquaintances at the pub during this time that paid for the drinks. The police located them, and they returned to the school. She was then introduced to mandrax and ended up using drugs. A Nigerian man abducted her from school and took her to an unknown location where she was kept. She stated that they forced her to smoke drugs after being assaulted.V2 described a certain Charles as one of the Nigerians from Vereeniging who sold girls. She regarded him as her boss who was nice and believed at the time she was in love with him. Charles sold her to a person called Austin. He became her boss and she was attracted to him. According to her evidence she also fell in love with Austin and had a sexual relationship with him. She began working as a prostitute for Austin under threat that her family will be harmed. She was sold back to Charles after Austin made a girl pregnant. Both Austin and Charles had drug dealings. Thereafter Charles sold her for R5000.00 to a person called Allaji. She described Allaji as one of the big bosses from Nigeria. His street name was Kenneth. She was taken to his flat at an unknown location and put to work as a prostitute. He already had 5 girls working as prostitutes. All of them were beaten up. He had a hold over her because of the drugs he supplied to her and expected her to pay him back from her earnings as a prostitute. She was also given a ‘wake up’ drug in the morning, in the afternoon and a ‘sleeper’ doze at night. Her addiction to crystal meth led to severe cravings.    Initially she worked on the streets and was then photographed and advertised on the internet offering sexual services. She was 16 at that stage. The clients would call her directly and make a booking. After they paid her, the money was handed to Allaji. After 5 years she managed to escape. After staying a week with her aunt, she arranged to meet a certain person called Moody whom she earlier knew. She arranged to meet him in Johannesburg but encountered a certain person called Chooks instead. Chooks, who was also Nigerian showed an interest in her and offered that she stays with him. He brought her to Pretoria and that is how she met the accused and the first complainant V1. They were living in a one room flat with a bathroom. Chooks left her there and returned to Johannesburg. It was V1 who told her that Chooks had sold her to the accused. She smoked rocks with V1. Because V1 had to see a client, she waited with the accused in another outside room. The accused told her that he loved her and wished to sleep with her. She refused. The accused again made sexual advances towards her which she again refused. He then forced himself on her, removed her clothes, put on a condom and had sexual intercourse with her against her will. She stated that at this moment, she ‘switched off’ which was understood to mean that she did not resist and she said because she felt nobody cared. She had an experience of being raped as a 13-year-old at gun point. She did not seek help from V1 because she sensed that V1 was as afraid of the accused as she was. Even the next morning, although V1 came across the condom in the bin, she did not disclose that she was raped, as she feared for her life. The accused arranged for Estcourt South Africa to photograph her. Pictures were taken of her in her underwear posing in different provocative positions. The pictures were paid for by the accused and she received many clients in response to the advertisement.The accused fixed her service rate at R400.00 for half an hour and R800.00 for an hour’s sex. The money earned was handed to the accused. She was given a cell phone to make the bookings. She did not contact her Aunt because she did not have her number. She was too scared to run away from the accused. She recalled how she was beaten by Allaji.She also narrated the events relating to further incident when the accused raped her. This happened during the evening shortly before the accused was arrested for the present case. She had earlier seen a client and called the accused to give him the money. He came by 6pm and wanted to have sex with her. She refused. He then forced himself on her and had sexual intercourse with her in the same manner as he did before. In exchange for the money she earned he gave her a ‘sleeper’ drug. She stated that it had been part of the rules she knew living with the Nigerians that all the money was given to them or you would be beaten up. The accused also threatened to assault her, and she feared that if she refused to work for him, her life would be in danger. Food in the house was scarce and sometimes she ate once a day.She was not allowed to go anywhere, and clients contacted her by cell phone. The language she used in court when describing the accused showed an intense hatred she bore for what he put her through. When asked if she though V1 feared the accused, her answer was a ‘deadly yes’. Apart from seeing clients, she also had to clean the house. The three weeks she lived there, she saw up to 5 clients a day. At times, she made up to R4000.00 a day for the accused.She was wearing a very revealing outfit before the police arrived. The accused bought that outfit because he wanted her to look sexy for clients. When the police knocked on the door, she hid the glass pipe and the drug pieces, were flushed down the toilet. She was high on drugs at the time and had consumed alcohol. Warrant officer Qegu took her to the bathroom where she showed her what she had hidden. She was hysterical at this stage. The officer asked her to pack her things and covered with a blanket. When they got to the car, she saw V1 hiding in the car. They were then taken to a safe house where they stayed for 6 months.Testimony of Warrant officersWarrant officers Qegu and Sithole testified about the events, which led to the arrest of the accused and the rescue of the 2nd complainant. Both officers were part of the Hawks unit and specially trained to work in the field of human trafficking. Qegu was with Sithole when they were assigned to attend to a case at Pretoria North Children’s Court. Qegu testified that she and Sithole attended court and met with magistrate Hitchcock who had made the report for police intervention. They also met V1, the 1st complainant there. She informed them how she and the 2nd complainant were being kept by the accused as sex workers against their will. The officers went to this venue after V1 made a call to establish that the accused was there. V1 pointed out the house but remained hidden in the vehicle. Before gaining entry to the accused premises she warned the girl inside not to run away as they were the police. The accused took some time to let them in.Except for a pair of pants, the accused was naked. The other person in the room was V2, who was very scantily dressed sitting on the bed drinking a beer. Because of the way the victim was dressed she took her to the bathroom whilst Sithole dealt with the accused. She described V2’s condition as being in a state of shock, disorientated and mostly incoherent. It appeared as if she was drunk or on drugs and was laughing for no reason. In the bathroom, V2 told her that shortly before the accused had given her drugs, which she smoked, he had sexual intercourse with her without consent. The accused told her to flush the rest of those drugs down the toilet when the officers knocked on the door. A glass pipe was found in the bathroom cabinet, which was placed in a sealed forensic exhibit bag. On inspection, a trace of a white powder-like substance was detected on the toilet seat. There was no food in the fridge.Both complainants were taken to a safe house and the accused was taken to the Brooklyn police station where he was charged the following day. The complainants were taken for medico legal examinations on the 14 May 2013 being the first available date. At the safe house, both complainants showed signs of drug withdrawal symptoms. V1 had red rashes on her body and V2 required specialist examination of her stomach. She arranged for victim impact reports to be compiled by police psychologist Major Stollarz.The witness stated that she booked out the exhibit bag of the evidence collected on the scene and took to the laboratory for forensic analysis. The analysis determined that it contained cocaine. The witness attempted to verify the address in Thembisa furnished by the accused where he allegedly worked. It led them to a Gold Exchange business. The owner, who also happened to be Nigerian, was questioned and he stated that he did not know the accused.Also booked into the SAP 13 register were all cell phones recovered from the accused and victims. These were sent for the data to be downloaded. The witness concluded her testimony by referring to a set of documents, some of which she obtained from V1 and some of which were found at the accused residence. These related to placement advertisements for sexual services under different names with deposit slips and receipts as proof of payment made to Sex Trader and Escort SA. All exhibits were handed in free of objection from the defence. In cross-examination, it was put to the witness that the accused knew nothing about the glass pipe, had not seen it before and did not hand it to V2. The witness’s explanation for the delay in taking V2 for a medico legal examination was that the events fell over a weekend and she stayed alone with her child. No other officer was available to take her to the doctor. It was put to the witness that the rape allegation was made only to make the case look stronger; the accused never had sexual intercourse with the victim on the day in question. He maintained that there was food in the fridge. It was also put to her that the accused would say that he had no knowledge of the documents relating to the advertisements in Sex Trader and Escort SA and saw them for the first time in court. He denied that the cell phone numbers appearing on the receipts were his.Warrant Officer Sithole’s testified and his evidence was in line with that of the testimony of Qegu. He confirmed that on meeting V1 she informed them that from 2009 the accused forced her to stay with him and used her as a sex worker. He stated that he did notice that the complainant was wearing lingerie and struggling to walk. Qegu took her into the bathroom. She was talking loudly, laughing and he did not find anything on the accused’s possession. In cross-examination, Sithole stated that Qegu informed him about the glass pipe she found when they were leaving the scene. After obtaining the accused’s consent, the witness read the accused’s entire Warning Statement, which he took on the day following the arrest into the record and it was received into evidence.As a follow-up to the Warning Statement he enquired and was informed by V1 that it was the accused who took away her motor bike. Under cross-examination and according to the witness’s recall, V2 told them that the accused had just finished raping her when they entered the room. It was also put to Sithole that the reason for the delay in having the medical examination done was to find something to link the accused to the offence. The defence introduced into evidence a map and set of photographs of the accused’s residence in Sandalwood Road for the purposes of showing the walking distance from the complex to the security point and the shopping centre.Testimony of the clinical psychologistMajor Stollarz, a clinical psychologist, testified as an expert witness. She adduced evidence based on a victimology report, which she complied at the request of the state. The purpose of her report and evidence was to assist the court in understanding the behaviour of victims of human trafficking from a psychological point of view, and to do so about the two complainants in the case. The conclusion she reached in her report was that ‘the complainants in the present matter were both, due to a number of developmental factors and traumas, and their abuse of substances, vulnerable to becoming victims of human trafficking. During the time that led up to their rescue they were subjected to witnessing and experiencing physical and sexual violence, threats, and encouragement of their addictions. Neither complainant wished to remain in the environment that they were in, but believed that they were unable to leave due to a number of psychological factors regarding the accused control over them, which included their fear of their own, or their families’ safety, substance addiction and lack of other viable alternatives. These victims were therefore exposed to the typical mechanisms used by traffickers to keep their victims in a web of trafficking that extended beyond the mere physical control to the expansive grip of psychological control’. There was no challenge to her testimony – the defence recorded that the accused had no objections and she was not cross-examined on her evidence. No additional psychiatric or other expert evidence was presented to the court.Statements of the accusedThe accused testified that he was born in Nigeria and came to South Africa in 2006. He entered South Africa on a visitor’s permit and later sought asylum as a refugee to reside legally in the country. One day, he met V1 by chance whilst walking in Sunnyside. He stopped her and spoke to her. She told him she was divorced, had one child and stayed in Pretoria North with her parents. She also informed him that she was a prostitute working on the streets, as she needed money to buy drugs. He told her it was ok because he loved her. He told her he liked her and wanted her to be his girlfriend. She agreed, and they began dating. They were in a relationship and she once slept over at his place. She took him to her home to meet her parents and they became very close. She also wanted to stay with him in Sunnyside and he agreed.By the end of 2009, they began living together. The accused stated that because he worked in Thembisa, he would leave home in the morning and return in the evening. He suspected that for the first 3 months together she continued being a prostitute because she was not home in the evenings. When he confronted her about this and she left to live with her parents. In this time, the accused informed her that he had moved to live in Faerie Glen. She returned to live with him and he did not want her engaging in prostitution anymore. She returned to live with her parents and began working as a receptionist for about 4 months. They continued seeing each other during this time and she was expecting his child in 2010. She alternated between staying with the accused and her parents. After giving birth, he visited the baby at her parent’s home. During February 2011 she brought the baby over and stayed with the accused for 2 weeks before going back to live with her parents. The accused then moved to live with a friend in Loskop Street. During this time, he was sending money to her using Shoprite money market. The reason she stayed there was because she had a sickly daughter. During 2013, she called him from Sunnyside for financial help as she had pawned her motor bike to buy drugs. He paid to have this bike released and she began living with him. He kept her bike away from her to avoid her using it again to obtain drugs. However, he allowed her to use it to visit her parents. V1 then returned to her parent’s home and the accused moved to live in Sandalwood Drive. Two months later, she called him to get directions to his new residence. They began living happily together once again. He had no idea what she whilst he was at work.One day she asked for money to place an advert offering her sexual services as she was bored staying alone and did not want to work on the streets. He refused. Two days later, he saw receipts for payments from newspapers and the internet relating to such adverts. He confronted her, and she confirmed that these related to her. He started discovering used condoms in the house and realised she was still engaging in prostitution. Although he wanted her to leave, he allowed her to stay on out of love. There was a time when her mother visited on a Sunday and they all spent time together. She even accompanied them to the mall and did shopping. He always ensured there were groceries in the house and they lived happily without any problems as ‘boyfriend and girlfriend’.Regarding the main charge of human trafficking, he maintained that V1 was his girlfriend with whom he had a child and they were in love. She was in contact with her family. They shared a bond. She had keys to the premises and could come and go as she pleased. He had his own business from which he made money and provided for her and their child. The income from managing the sale of broken gold and diamonds business brought in a high profit. At times he earned up to R10 000.00 a month and he also got money from gambling.  This enabled him to pay the rent, buy a car and see to his expenses. He received no money from her and earned no money off her. He had never supplied her with drugs and had no idea how and from where she got it. On a question by the court at the end of his testimony, he admitted that she told him she bought “rocks” from Arcadia or Sunnyside. She used drugs without him knowing or seeing her use it. She engaged in prostitution only to buy drugs, as there was always food in the house. Only on one occasion, did he see and become aware that a client came to the house for sexual favours. He denied ever having assaulted her.Regarding V2, he stated that he knew her boyfriend Chooks and that is how he met her. Chooks had moved to Pretoria from Johannesburg and was looking out for a place where his girlfriend could live for a while. Both he and V1 agreed that V2 could stay with them. According to his evidence, she was only there for 3 weeks. He was aware that she was originally from Vereeniging, but was staying in Johannesburg. He denied having bought V1 from his friend and stated that had no personal relationship with her. He had no knowledge that she was a prostitute or that she was advertised on the internet as he was not home most of the time. He also knew nothing about her drug addiction and denied having supplied her with any drugs. He strongly denied the allegations that he had raped her on two occasions and did not know why she said this. According to him, V2 was surprised and questioned the police as to why the accused was being arrested, as V1 was the accused’s boyfriend. For days after his arrest, the police also mention nothing concerning a charge of rape. He got to know for the first time of such charge in court.According to him, if the police found a pipe in the bathroom they would have shown it to him and asked for an explanation. He denied that any drugs were found by the police.In cross-examination, it emerged that he came on a visiting visa, and did not apply for a business one although he started his own business at the end of 2006. He could not say with certainty when he obtained his asylum permit or where his passport was. He could not explain why his brother at the gold exchange business told the police he was not working there. Thereafter he was examined regarding V1’s version and his responses were a denial, either that he had no knowledge or could not comment on it. He did confirm that V1 explained to him and he knew what “rocks” were, but he had not seen these drugs. At first, he stated that he noticed a change in her behaviour when she used drugs and he knew exactly when she was using drugs because she broke out into boils on her face and body. He had often seen her in a drugged state. Under later examination, he stated that she never showed any difference in behaviour if she did not use drugs. He held the belief that no person addicted to drugs could be controlled and that a drug addict could stop taking drugs anytime they chose unless they liked taking drugs.Regarding V2, his earlier testimony was that he had no knowledge that she was a prostitute or that she was advertised on the internet as he was not home most of the time. Under cross-examination, he stated that V1 informed him that V2 had joined her on the internet. Although he stated that he never saw her",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"The appellant's version was that she met the three complainants on the beach near Maputo in Mozambique where the complainants worked as prostitutes. They told her that they wanted to work as prostitutes in South Africa. She then agreed to accommodate the complainants as prostitutes in Pretoria where she resided. The appellant had a hair salon in the central business district of Pretoria where she also sold clothing. From the evidence, it is clear that the appellant knew the complainants from Mozambique. The appellant commuted between Pretoria and Mozambique regularly to visit and sell clothing. When she returned from Mozambique after one of her trips and while the appellant was in Pretoria, one of the complainants phoned the appellant and said that they were near Komatipoort. The appellant testified that she then asked a friend of hers to transport the complainants to Pretoria. When they arrived in Pretoria, the three complainants stayed with the appellant in her flat in Silver Lakes, east of Pretoria. The flat was too small and the appellant decided to rent a 3-bedroom house in Moreleta Park, a short distance from her flat. A brothel was kept at that house. The appellant was arrested and some of the complainants were taken into custody there. The Regional Magistrate rejected the appellant's evidence on grounds of credibility. Her rejected evidence only differed from that of the complainants in respect of the complainants' alleged prostitution in Mozambique and the collection of the complainants near Komatipoort. The balance of the evidence that led to the appellant's conviction (which she never challenged on appeal) was based to a large extent on circumstantial evidence. The evidence of the complainants was accepted. Their evidence was that they did meet the appellant in Mozambique where she promised them work in her hair salon and an opportunity to study while working there. They were looking for a better life. She then arranged for them to come to South Africa and the appellant in person collected all three of them at or near Komatipoort. The complainants testified that they worked for the appellant at her hair salon in Pretoria for a few days. They were forced to smoke cannabis and to have sexual intercourse with several men daily. They said they were not paid for doing so.One of the complainants returned to Mozambique before the appellant's arrest. She returned because she refused to perform all the sexual acts demanded by the appellant's elderly male clients. She was whisked away from the appellant's establishment and transported by taxi to Mozambique. She was given a passport containing the photograph of another individual to pass through immigration counters at the border posts. The passport was, when she was dropped off in Maputo, taken back by the taxi driver. After she reported her ordeal to her boyfriend and family in Maputo (her boyfriend gave evidence in the Court a quo) they went to the Mozambican Police to report the incident. After having reported the incident, the policeman to whom it was reported demanded payment of money from the victim and her relatives and boyfriend before he would conduct an investigation. The investigation only later followed after the victim and her boyfriend contacted a senior police official in Mozambique who then, in collaboration with the South African Police Service, secured the appellant's prosecution.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence

She testified that the accused made her his wife, touching her private parts and doing things he was not supposed to do to her.She stated that when the accused slept with her for the first time, she got hurt and started bleeding. The complainant furthermore testified that she reported the abuse to her mother and the school counsellor. Her mother did not do anything and when she showed her the soiled underwear her mother burned it. She testified that her mother did confront the accused.

Her parents fought and on the following day the accused chased her mother away. Her mother left with two of her siblings and she was left alone outside the house. Her father, the accused also left with her other two siblings. The complainant had no-one else that she could turn to. The complainant contemplated what to do and then decided to go with the accused whom she found at the bus station. After consideration, she thought that she would stand a chance of a better life and a better future if she went with the accused and that perhaps, he would not repeat the things he had done to her previously. Her evidence was that she thought she was going to be a street kid, a child with no future. She had no idea where her mother had gone and felt like an orphan.At the bus station, she asked the accused whether she could go with him and he agreed. Her evidence was that deep down in her heart she was fearful but decided to go with the accused as she had no parent to support her or take her to school. They then left Swaziland in about October 2014 and came to South Africa. After a long commute, they eventually arrived at a homestead at Makhonyeni. She was about 13 years old, doing grade five at that time.For the whole of 2014, the accused did nothing and in 2015, the accused started touching the complainant’s private parts again.

She could not recall how many times the accused had sexual intercourse with her. She testified that the accused would have sex with her on the floor when she is sleeping on the floor and sometimes on the bed. He never gave her any space as a child as he would touch her breast or private parts wherever she was sitting.Her siblings who were then aged seven and five years old respectively, would be sent outside to play or would be sent to the shop in order to give the accused an opportunity to have sex with the complainant. There were times when they observed him touching the complainant. They would even see the complainant crying at times.The accused did not allow the complainant out of the house but did allow her to attend school. She was responsible for the cleaning and household chores.She testified that the accused stopped sleeping with her when he realised that she was pregnant.The complainant testified that she informed a nurse at Jozini hospital that her father was abusing her.

"The accused, Mr Veeran Palan and Ms Edwina Norris are charged with ten (10) counts which include: Count 1 and 2 is the illegal and intentional trafficking for sexual of complainant 1 and 2 in contravention of section 71(1) of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and related Matters) Amendment Act, 32 of 2007.Count 3 is the illegal keeping of a brothel in contravention of S2 of the Sexual Offences Act 23 of 1957.Count 4 and 5 is the charge of procuring the two complainants to have unlawful carnal intercourse with someone else in contravention of s a, b, and C of s10 of the sexual Offences Act 23 of 1957Count 6 is knowingly acquire, possess or use the illegal proceeds from acts of prostitutionCount 7 and 8 is kidnappingCount 9 and 10 is conspiring with an unidentifiable person to commit sexual offence. The crime of trafficking was prosecuted in terms of section 70 of the Sexual Offences Act, 32 of 2007. The Prevention and Combatting of Trafficking in Persons Act 7 of 2013 was assented to by the President of the Republic of South Africa on 28 July 2013 but had not been enacted. The first complainant CB is a 29 year old wife and mother of four young children, testified that during 2013 she was living with her husband and four children in Cape Town. She was unemployed and with a grade 10 education it was difficult to find a job. During July 2013 accused 2’s mother approached her with a cell phone and said that accused 2 wanted to speak to her. She had known accused 2 for some 12 years because they had been at school together and lived in the same street. She knew that accused 2 was working away from her family home. Accused 2 offered her a job as a cleaner in a Margate hotel in KZN. CB was keen to earn an income and undertook to speak to her husband. Accused 2 promised to phone her again with more details. CB’s husband did not have a good feeling about the offer. Accused 2 thereafter phoned again and told CB that Vees, her employer, would buy her a ticket to travel to KZN by bus. CB arranged with her mother to take care of the children. Her mother undertook to obtain more information about the job from accused 2 and also from Vees. Later that day accused 2’s mother called CB to her again and she was shown a photograph of accused 2 in what appeared to be a waitress’s uniform. This finally persuaded CB to accept the job offer and she contacted accused 2 to tell her. She enquired about the salary she would receive and accused 2 told her that she would hear when she was there. CB spoke to her husband about the job offer and although he was initially not happy to let her go but told her that she could if she wanted to. He too had spoken to accused 2.  On the 17th July 2013 she received a bus ticket confirmation by text from Vees. He also advised her that SN second complainant, also from Cape Town, would accompany her. She knew SN. CB’s father searched the Internet and reported that there was a Margate hotel in the Port Shepstone area. She now was convinced that all was above board with the job offer.  The next morning her mother took her to the bus terminus in Cape Town and travelled with SN to Port Shepstone. During the journey she stayed in telephonic contact with her mother and with Vees. They arrived in Port Shepstone on the 19th July 2013 at 9.30 in the evening and phoned accused 2. Vees, who turned out to be accused 1, was there to pick them up. He took them to his home. She had no idea where the hotel was that she was to work at. She had never been to KZN. Accused 1’s wife was at the house and she showed the two women their bedrooms, told them to bath before they would have something to eat and said that accused 2 was still at work and would be there shortly. Accused 2 arrived with two other ladies, J and M. Accused 2 was not in a waitress uniform but like the other two ladies she was scantily dressed. CB and SN thought they were dressed like prostitutes. Accused 1 made them sit down at a table and then disclosed to them that they were in fact not there to work in a hotel but that they would work as prostitutes; that accused 2 and the other ladies worked for him as sex workers. He said that CB and SN had no option but to do it as well since they needed to pay for the bus tickets he had provided. It had cost R1200 apiece. CB did not know what to say. She was nervous because she had noticed a handgun tucked into the back of accused 1’s trousers. Prostitution was however unacceptable to her. Accused 2 did not say anything either. She asked accused 2 what was to happen and accused 2 apologized for having lied to CB and SN. She explained that she had to find a replacement for herself before she would be allowed to return to Cape Town. This was confirmed by accused 1.      Accused 1 wanted them to start working that very night but CB and SN said that they were too tired. CB sent her mother a text on her cell phone after 1 am to tell her what had happened. After breakfast the next morning accused 2 took them to a shopping centre and bought them provocative clothing and underwear. That afternoon they were taken to the house of accused 1’s friend, a Dr M where they were entertained with food and alcohol. In the meantime CB’s uncle S phoned SN’s phone. He wanted to know where CB was finding herself but she was unable to give any directions. That evening the women were told to put on the clothes and underwear bought for them. Four men arrived at the house and the five women were told to stand in a line. The other women were each picked by a man (including accused 2) and CB considered herself fortunate that no-one picked her. She remained in the dining room while the others went to the bedrooms for sex. J was the first to return and she received a call about a stag party. When the other women were done, accused 1 drove the six of them to a Lodge at the Crocodile farm. Five men approached accused 1 and enquired how much the party and the girls would cost. Accused 1 advised them that it would cost R1000 for a stripping session and R350 for half an hour with a girl. There were many men at what turned out to be a bachelor party. An Indian man approached CB for sex. He paid accused 1 R400 and took CB to a room. She however disclosed to him that she was not a prostitute and how it had happened that she landed up there. She made it clear that she did not want him to have sex with him. The man undertook to help her and they conversed. Accused 1 arrived after a while and said that time was up and the man had to leave. Accused 1 drove the girls, except for accused 2 who stayed at the party, back home. On the way J was dropped at Dr M’s house. There was further business and four men arrived. This time CB was chosen by one of the men. SN was also chosen but said she did not feel good about it. The man took CB to a room and again she explained that she was not a prostitute and that she was there against her will. The man said he just wanted to converse and did not want sex although he had paid accused 1 R350. CB and the man conversed and when they left the bedroom they found accused 1 and Samantha arguing. At that moment CB’s mother phoned accused 1. Accused 1 told her that CB was at work but her mother had heard CB’s voice and accused 1 then told her they had just arrived from work. Although he was angry he passed the phone to CB but remained in attendance. As a result CB was unable to tell her mother what was happening. She said to her mother that everything was fine and that she could contact her in the morning. Accused 1 was upset about the phone call because he felt that CB’s mother was messing with his business. He threatened CB. She did not end the call with the result that her mother could hear how accused 1 was arguing with her and SN.     Between 3 and 4 am accused 1’s son and two other youngsters arrived at the house. Accused 1 did not want his son to see him; so accused 1’s wife (who happened to be a lady of Chinese origin) attended to business. Accused 1’s son went to sit in the car outside and a 17 year old boy paid her R400 to have sex with CB. Once they were in the bedroom CB disclosed to the prospective customer that she did not want to engage in prostitution and did not want to have sex with him. The youngster insisted and removed her clothes and told her to give him a condom. When she would not, he took one from a table in the room, put it on and told her to lie down. She resisted but he pushed her onto her back on the bed and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her. Although she pushed him off her, he mounted and penetrated her once again. She managed to push him off once again and he left the room and complained to accused 1. Accused 1 came into the bedroom and told her that he would see her in the morning. The next morning accused 1 confronted her and SN. He was rude and said they owed him R250 each for the food consumed by them as well as another R100 for advertising their bodies on the Internet. They were also to pay for their accommodation. From the R150, R100 and R50 respectively which he had given her for having been with three customers, she gave him R200. Accused 2 suggested that they be taken to a pub but accused 1 did not want them to go out and drink. Accused 2 then lied to him and said they were going out to eat and go to the cinema. Four of them took a taxi to a pub and enjoyed a few drinks and the outing. Uncle S again phoned SN who then enquired from others what the name of the pub was and conveyed this to Uncle S. At that point accused 2 was outside with another man. Half an hour later two police officers arrived. One had a photograph of CB which uncle S had sent to them. He took CB and SN with him to the police station in Port Shepstone where they made statements. At some point accused 2, accused 1 and his wife arrived. Accused 1 demanded to know why the police had taken the women there. CB identified accused 1 to the police and he was arrested. Then they enquired which one was Bonnie and when accused 2 was pointed out, she too was arrested. CB and SN were taken to accused 1’s house to fetch their clothes. Accused 1s wife allowed them to. According to CB she had been afraid of accused 1 and his firearm and the manner in which he talked to them and therefore had not made an attempt to leave the house earlier. They were also watched by accused 1 and his wife. On one of the three occasions when she was picked by customers, she was too scared to refuse. One look at accused 1’s face persuaded her to oblige.  Her understanding was that while accused 1 made all the arrangements with men, his wife managed the prostitutes. She saw him receive all the money.      When asked in the course of cross-examination why she had not run away from the house of accused 1, she told the court that she was afraid to do so. She thought accused 1 to be well-connected and she did not know whom to trust. She at one point said that she could not think clearly The court found that the evidence clearly showed that accused 1 and 2 had employed deception to lure the two complainants to Port Shepstone for the purpose of getting them to engage in prostitution and provided the finances and means of transferring them here. They were also harboured and accommodated by accused 1. The women did not freely and with full knowledge of all the material facts consent thereto. Consequently both accused are found guilty of the main counts of trafficking, illegal keeping of a brothel, procuring the victims to have unlawful carnal intercourse, knowingly acquire, possess or use the illegal proceeds from acts of prostitution (accused 2 was acquitted of this charge) and kidnapping. The second accused were acquitted on count 9 and 10.  Accused 1 was sentenced to 10 years and a fine of R10,000 or 5 months imprisonment. Accused 2 was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"The defendant, a 28 year old man, arranged a customary marriage with the complainant’s uncle which led to her abduction. The complainant was, at the time, 14 years old. The custom of abducting girls for the purposes of marriage, sometimes with the permission of their family, is known as ukuthwala in South Africa. The complainant was restrained and transported to the defendant’s village. She attempted to escape two times, and was successful the second time in arriving back to her village, but was subsequently apprehended by her uncle and returned to the defendant. She was then beaten and raped eight times, and was locked in the house when the defendant and his relatives were going out. After a few days, the complainant jumped over the fence and sought help from the police.",drug offences,Sentenced
"With the exception of victim LK (counts 5 and 6), who was abducted under false pretences, three girls; JC, CM and AC (mentioned in counts 1-4 and 6-8), all under the age of 16 at the time, were through misrepresentations made to them and their parents lured to South Africa by a certain ‘Aunt Juliet Chauke’  to visit family and / or with the promise of their attending schools and obtaining a better education than what they could get in Mozambique. Accused no 2, Violet Chauke, is Juliet’s younger sister, while Alice Chauke, AC’s mother was Juliet’s elder sister.  According to the uncontested evidence of these children, Juliet Chauke, who has since disappeared back into Mozambique and never charged in this matter, has also ‘trafficked’ her younger sister Violet Chauke, to South Africa in a similar way, but, later, when she became adult, she got a work and remained in South Africa.JC was sent by her parents with Juliet and others to come and visit over the school holidays – also with a promise that she would return, which never happened. When she asked Juliet why she is not going back, she said that there was no money. AC was sent by her mother, Juliet’s and Violet’s elder sister to South Africa with a promise of better schooling, which never materialized – but she was never allowed to return. LK was abducted under false pretences after her primary care giver, her grandmother, refused Juliet permission to bring her to South Africa for better schooling. Later, however, Juliet found her on the way and told her that her grandmother had now agreed and, she was then made to accompany Juliet and others. She was also never enrolled at school in South Africa and not allowed to return. CM came to South Africa with Juliet in the presence of her own mother, Alice and her younger sister JM and others. The purported reason for their trip was to visit family members over the school holidays, after which they would return. Her mother returned, but she and her sister remained behind. When the mother later phoned and asked when they would be sent back, Juliet said that there was no money for that and that she would enrol them at school in South Africa. JC, AC and LK were brought to South Africa in 2009, while CM was brought during 2010.Since none of them had valid passports, all of them were at different occasions smuggled over or through the border fence with South Africa, while Juliet used the border gate with a valid passport. On the other side of the border they were met by Juliet and other people, (sometimes a man perceived to be Juliet’s husband) and they were eventually transported to the place called Makostering (Rhenosterhoek) plantation village. This lumberjacks’ village is a very remote place with no direction or information boards, and a stranger would find it difficult to find the place without help and would experience true desolation if left there without food or shelter. A desolated place indeed, and if a stranger was brought there and chased away, as some of these children were threatened should they not do what they were told, they would literally not have anywhere to go.Once resident in one of the small houses in the village, these girls were at different times, sometimes in the presence of others, taken (or sent) by Juliet, or fetched by accused no 1, to a larger house, about 1.5 kilometres away from the village, which reportedly belonged to accused no 1, the manager of the plantation / timber farm, and which was used as a residence by him. All of these witnesses described how they were then from time to time made to enter the bedroom, where they would be undressed (either by Juliet or accused no 1), or, later when they got used to it, they themselves did so, and they were also raped by accused no 1 on these occasions. All of them, with the exception of JC, who was raped only once, were raped several times according to their evidence. Each time they were being taken to the larger house by Juliet, or, later when they got used to their being exploited in this way, called or sent (by Juliet or, in her absence, by Violet, accused no 2) to go and attend accused no 1’s sexual pleasures. Sometimes he would pay Juliet, sometimes he would give them money to give to either Juliet or Violet, accused no 2. JC said that, when she was subsequent to her rape called to Mabuza’s house, she told the messengers that they should tell him that she is in her periods so that she did not have to go, and thus she evaded being raped a second time.Three of them (AC, CM and JC) testified that they were during the first time threatened by accused no 1 with a fire arm should they not do what he says. Some of them (excluding only AC who was at the very first time forced to do so) at first refused to sleep with Mabuza, accused no 1, after which they were threatened by Juliet that they would be chased away, that they would not have anywhere to go or food to eat and, sometimes food like meat would be refused. This motivated the children to simply do as they were told.It further emerged from the evidence of the children that there were times that Juliet would be absent – on her errands to Mozambique to traffick others or, simply to visit – and that the children would then be left in the care of her younger sister, Violet, accused no 2. From time to time, when Mabuza wanted to see one of them, he would phone Violet when she would ready them and send them to him (or he would come and fetch them), where they would be raped as before. Sometimes he would give them money that they had to give to accused no 2. During these times, Violet would care for them (harbour them) by giving them food, whilst fully knowing what they were there for and she would ready them and send them to accused no 1 at his request. All of the girls knew all too well they would be left destitute if they did not do as told.The history described by some of the children about accused no 2, Violet, who was also trafficked (by her own elder sister) to South Africa for the sexual pleasure of accused no 1, shows that, when Violet became too old for his attentions, she got a work in the plantation at Rhenosterhoek, and that Juliet then had to go and look for new young blood to come and replace her.One of the things that disturbed the children the most, was that, whenever they reported to Juliet that the accused had injured their private parts during the rapes, and that they bled, she did not respond or help them in any way. To AC she simply said that she would be alright and she would get used to it eventually. To the contrary, when they verbalised their unwillingness to be subjected to rape, or when they subsequently complained and appeared to be unwilling, Juliet threatened them with abandonment in this desolate place, where all of them were strangers. When they requested to be sent back, Juliet always indicated that there was no money. When they enquired about being sent to school, there was no money. To LK she said that she had to sleep with accused no 1 to get money to buy school uniforms. All this while they were related to Juliet, or knew her well enough to view her in a position of authority and trust and who seriously betrayed the trust of the children.One day, JC decided to pack her things and run away from there and, at school, she was found out. The principal and the social worker, Lucia Sonya Khoza were summoned to speak to her. The most that they got out of her was that the other children that she left behind on the farm at Rhenosterhoek was being maltreated and sexually abused. When this was reported to the principal and the social worker, reports were made to the police, which led to Ramodike and others going to the village, where the other children were found. They were in a bad shape, clothes in tatters and dirty, their hair unkempt and in dreadlocks, and they were clearly very hungry.This is where the investigation started. The investigation, before the matter was handed over to Nyathi, was however poorly done. Accused no 1 and Violet were arrested only much later. The particular house in which the incidents reportedly happened was never searched. Accused no 1’s fire arm was only later seized. Etcetera. The children were however put in a place of safety and, eventually, when they properly disclosed what happened statements must have been taken from them, which led to the case being investigated with a view to prosecute and the institution of these proceedings.Accused no 1’s evidenceHe stated that he had worked for York Timbers, until he started his own business rendering contracting services to York Timber at Rhenosterhoek and Blystaan from 2001. Juliet Chauke had worked for his enterprise at Blystaan under a sub-contractor.He stated that the first time ever he saw accused no 2, was during 2011 or 2012, when she started working there as a general labourer. He never had any sexual relationship with accused no 2 or any of the children who testified, whom he did not even know. The first time he ever saw the children that testified, is when they appeared on the TV screen during their testimony. He does not know whether his employees could have family members visit or stay with them in the village, because that was York Timbers’ responsibility. If he wanted to employ more people, he had to ask York Timbers whether his people could use more houses in the village.He cannot deny that the children who testified were staying in that village from 2009 to 2012 as they said they did. He cannot dispute the ages that the children testified they were at the time, nor their reported dates of birth. He however said that he can dispute that the children were ever raped in the main house, because at the relevant time, 2009 to 2011, neither he nor anyone else lived there. He does not know how the children could know of the suite bathroom in the main bedroom to that house. He specifically denied that he ever wore the firearm to work from 2006 until the date of his arrest, and he could therefore not say how the children could have known that he even possesses a firearm. There has never been any bad blood between him and Juliet, or between him and Violet, that could have turned the kids against him. He cannot say whether any of the children could have harboured a motive to falsely implicate him with these serious allegations, but he had overheard that they might have thought that he had a lot of money and that they would get some money if they falsely implicated him. It was pointed out to him that this version of his did not fly, because none of the children, out of their own, laid a charge against him. This case was uncovered by social workers and the police, not by the children. He however insisted that all of them were lying, just to get him into trouble.Accused no 2’s versionAccused no 2 never testified, but her version that was put to the children was that she never had anything to do with their maltreatment, and that she only gave them shelter and food during the absence of Juliet. One or two of the children agreed with this, but others made it clear that, in Juliet’s absence, she pertinently readied them and sent them to accused no 1 at his telephonic requests, and that, at occasion, she received money from accused no 1 via them. These allegations by the children were never denied by her in evidence that could be tested through cross-examination for the veracity thereof.Examination of the victims by a forensic nurse and a medical doctorKok is a forensic nurse and Grabe a medical doctor and professor, who is an expert in dealing with the examination of victims, especially children in sexual assault cases. Kok saw injuries on the private parts of only certain of the girls that she examined, but was quick to add, which was confirmed by Grabe, that the absence of injuries does not necessarily exclude sexual penetration. She was however clearly inexperienced compared to Grabe, who saw more clear indications on the private parts of all the girls she examined that was indicative of sexual penetration of their genitals. This evidence serves to support the four complainants’ versions that they have been sexually penetrated. Of course, these witnesses could not say whether the children had been raped and by whom, although the lesions on their private part were indicative of tears that have healed, which suggested that at least some force had to be used to effect penetration. In her professional opinion based on scientific observations, Grabe, in addition, also put the relevant ages of the girls at the same level than the respective ages that they gave her and the court.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"Second accused, Lionel Richard Ball, had seen “groups of prostitutes” on the side of the road previously, and asked his domestic worker and co-accused, Nokuzola Ntonga, specifically to fetch V. for him. Evidently, amongst these “groups of prostitutes” stood young girls who were not prostitutes. V. was not a prostitute, and may have been a virgin.Ntonga went to fetch V. from her home, where she resided with her elder sister. V. had known Ntonga prior to the incident. V. was not home, but her sister told Ntonga that V. was at a friend or relative’s house. Ntonga then retrieved V. from the friend or relative’s house. Ntonga told V. and the caretakers of the house that she was taking V. to see a social worker to get shoes and clothes.Rather, Ntonga drove V. to Ball’s home in East London where Ball allegedly raped V. He then allegedly forced her into the shower and locked her in his bedroom when a friend and witness in the case, Raath, visited Ball’s house for a few hours. Raath testified that he did see a young black child, but did not know if she was a girl or what her purpose was of being there. After Raath left, Ball drove V. home. Ball admitted that she was at his home, but claims he only let her watch television, take a shower, and gave her clothes and R200 to purchase shoes.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"This case involved an urgent application by Mavericks Revue bar, a “gentlemen’s club” in Cape Town, to stop the Department of Home Affairs from terminating its corporate permits, pending a separate judicial review of the withdrawal of the permits. Mavericks Revue bar required the corporate permits in order to legally employ foreign dancers at the establishment.The background to the dispute was that Mavericks had applied to the Department in March 2010 to have 143 out of 200 corporate permits replaced, claiming that they were “lost, mislaid or stolen over many years”. In deciding whether to allow the application the Department learnt Mavericks had not complied with the relevant legislation and the conditions of the corporate worker authorisation certificates. It was claimed by the Department that Mavericks’ corporate workers were not employees but independent contractors who were not paid a wage or salary and that Mavericks’ failed to keep proper records, inform the Department when a worker left, ensure corporate workers complied with provisions of the legislation and ensure foreign workers departed after completion of their tour of duty. On the basis of these reasons, among others, the Department decided to withdraw the corporate permits.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"SummaryThe three defendants were found guilty on multiple counts relating to running an illegal enterprise which illegally harvested and exported abalones. In March 2019, they were sentenced to 15-18 years imprisonment.Illegal harvesting and trading of abalone have been a reason for concern in South Africa’s Eastern Cape since the 1990s. The seaside city Port Elizabeth is considered a hub for the illegal trade in abalone and has been declared to be a hotspot of criminal enterprises and kingpins. The numbers of abalone, which is mostly sold as delicacy to Asia, has been in decline, sparking the government to respond to the issue by establishing dedicated teams seeding abalone and patrolling the area.Details On 22 March 2015, a member of the South African Police Service observed suspicious activities while being on patrol along the coast heading towards Noordhoek. He observed individuals coming out of the water loading backs onto vehicles. He chased the vehicles and was able to arrest one suspect after a hot pursuit, encountering abalone on the suspect’s car. Another suspect working for the defendants was found in possession of abalone without a permit a month later. The South African Police Service launched an investigation into the operation of the defendants.The lead investigator described the illegal operations of the defendants as syndicate-like. While their enterprise relied on the support of several people, the defendants conducted their operations on a need-to-know basis, in which different participants in the supply chain would have limited knowledge about the overall operation. Abalones are being harvested by divers using diving equipment provided for by the accused. The harvested abalones would be packed and marked with an identification mark of the respective harvester. From there, the abalones would be loaded onto motor vehicles, from where a driver would take them to the “weight house”. In that station, the abalones would be sorted by size, had their shell removed and weighted. Based on their weight, the divers would be paid. Another driver would then take the abalones to another location where they would be stored in freezers. Yet another person would later pick them up to transport them to the processing plant, where the abalones get cleaned and cooked. Via the cities of Gauteng or Cape Town, the abalones would ultimately be shipped to China and sold as delicacy.",trafficking in firearms,Sentenced
"In January 2009, Peter Michael Roberts (accused 1) and six co-accused were arrested by the erstwhile Directorate of Special Operations (the Scorpions) following a police operation codenamed Operation May. The enterprise traded and distributed approximately 30 tons of shucked abalone over a period of 40 months. The State argued that Peter Roberts was the mastermind and that his co-accused were central to the enterprise.Two of the accused, who were arrested five kilometres from the Lebombo border post between South Africa and Mozambique, are not subject to this trial since both pleaded guilty and entered a plea bargain with the State. Both were convicted and sentenced but not incarcerated. The remaining five accused all denied complicity in the offences, which included conducting an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activities (2005 – 2009), in the illicit trade in and transportation of abalone – in a truck with a concealed roof – to Mozambique.The State demonstrated that Peter Roberts was indeed central to the enterprise by relying on witness testimony, documentary evidence obtained through a seizure operation, and transcripts from intercepted phone calls to and from Roberts. It was found that their operation possessed, transported, and exported abalone from the Eastern Cape to Mozambique. The illegal trade in abalone was the predicate offence to the more serious crime of racketeering, that carries a heavier sentence, which necessitated the State to demonstrate the existence of an enterprise with a pattern of more than two incidents and show the involvement of the accused in the enterprise. The racketeering pattern was established by triangulating the abovementioned evidence to cases in which s204 witnesses (see commentary) testified about the complicity of the accused in similar cases in which the witnesses were duly convicted and sentenced.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"3 individuals were charged in the criminal trial for manufacturing methamphetamine in contravention of the Drugs Act. The main accused S.P. was accused of operating a drug manufacturing laboratory from his residence. He owned the property. The State also brought civil forfeiture proceedings against the property which S.P., as the owner of the property, opposed.S.P. was criminally charged with contraventions of the Drugs Act. He was found manufacturing methamphetamine in a laboratory in his home. He was however acquitted of these charges on the basis of technical problems with a search and seizure warrant that led to the discovery of the laboratory. The State also brought civil asset forfeiture proceedings against the property on the basis that the property was used to manufacture drugs. This application was successful, notwithstanding several appeals, including an appeal to the Constitutional Court by S.P.The criminal proceedings and asset forfeiture proceedings were instituted simultaneously. S.P. brought an application to stay the civil forfeiture proceedings pending the finalization of his criminal case. He contended that the civil proceedings would violate his right to remain silent. This application was dismissed and forfeiture granted as the court found that the decision to oppose forfeiture of his property did not amount to a compulsion to speak in violation of his right to remain silent. S.P. had a choice to defend the forfeiture application or he could remain silent. The court held that it was not required to protect him from the consequences of exercising this difficult choice. The court ordered that the property be forfeited to the State on the basis that it was used to manufacture drugs in contravention of the Drugs Act.After his acquittal in the criminal case S.P. argued that the forfeiture was unfair as the criminal court had acquitted him of the charges. His property could therefore not be forfeited as the criminal court had not been satisfied that the crimes he was accused of were in fact committed. The appeal court found that the state had proved on a civil standard that the property was used to manufacture methamphetamine and the findings of the criminal court were irrelevant to the forfeiture proceedings.S.P. then appealed to the Constitutional Court asking the court to declare the forfeiture order an unfair violation of his fair trial rights (to remain silent, not to incriminate himself) and his right to property. He also ask the court to find that the lower court should have granted him a stay of the civil forfeiture proceedings pending. He was unsuccessful in his constitutional challenge and the property was forfeited to the State.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"This case mainly concerns the conduct of alleged human trafficking and facilitation to such crimes which was prosecuted by the High Court in Pretoria, South Africa. During the period 1 April 2016 up to September 2016, defendant 3, namely C.J. Obasi, harboured at least two victims at Jaspit Court with the alleged intent to exploit his victims sexually. Both of the victims who testified as witnesses before the Court were first brought to contact with the said defendant by their acquaintances. Prior to arriving at Jaspit Court, the victims had been living in vulnerable conditions resulting from irregular immigrant status, addiction to drugs, as well as complicated family issues. And such conditions were later taken advantage of by the traffickers to gain control over the victims. Although victims seemlingly came to Jaspit Court out of their free will, they were subsequently controlled with drugs, threatened by force, and repeatedly assaulted by the said defendant. The victims worked as prostitutes during such period of time but were forced to hand over all the incomes they had made. They also had to entertain “smoking clients”, visitors who come to consume drugs. It was also reported that the victims were pushed to have sexual intercourse with Obasi due to the hierarchical relationship between them. At the same time, the victim enjoyed little personal freedom: they were not allowed to go anywhere on their own during daytime, and later following a failed attempt to escape, they were not allowed to leave the flat at all during daytime.  While defendant 3, Obasi, carried out the major activities, defendant 1, namely Abba, was trained and served to run the “business” in the exact same manner during Obasi’s temporary absence. Defendant 2, Mkhonto, who had once been romantically involved with Obasi, leased to him the property in which the victims were harboured. However, she was not directly involved, nor had she ever met the victims in the entire process.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence

"From 2010 to 2014, the defendant Mr Z. conducted a criminal enterprise to fraudulently purchase goods on commercial websites. To this end, Mr Z. used stolen credit card data found on carding forums by himself, Mr P. (the technical advisor of the group) and Mr N. (a member of the group in charge of finding credit card data), as well as credit card data that Mr L. had stolen from his former employer.

"Subject of the case are legal proceedings initiated by Cédric H. and his colleagues to challenge the constitutionality of Articles L.622-1 and L 622-4 of the French Code on the Entry and Residence of Foreign Nationals and the Right to Asylum. The applicants claimed that the offence of facilitating the illegal entry, movement and residence of a foreign person infringed upon the principle of fraternity, as it did not sufficiently take into account humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants without material or financial compensation.The French Constitutional court, first of all, clarified that the principle of fraternity enjoyed constitutional value as it is enshrined in Art. 2 and 72-3 of the Constitution and, secondly, that it comprised the freedom to help one another without consideration as to whether the assisted person is legally residing within the French territory. On the other hand, the principle of fraternity must be balanced against the legislature’s responsibility to safeguard public order.  Applied to the legislation at hand, the Court found that criminalizing any assistance to irregular migrants, including when it is given for humanitarian reasons, did not strike a fair balance between the afore-mentioned principles and violated the constitutional provisions on fraternity. The Court, however, dismissed arguments based on the necessity and proportionality principles, legal certainty principle, protection of human dignity, and equality before the law which it considered not to be infringed upon by the legislation in question.",trafficking in firearms,Not Sentence
"The plaintiff, a woman of unknown age, established that she had been recruited and subjected to accommodation and work conditions contrary to human dignity by the two Respondents, a married couple for whom she worked, for their material benefit. The Plaintiff states that the Second Respondent had approached her with the promise that, if she came to work in France with the brother of the Second Respondent, she would receive a salary and would be able to follow literacy courses. The plaintiff was thus subjected to accommodation and working conditions which were contrary to her human dignity, as well as forced domestic servitude at the hands of – and for the benefit of - Respondents 1 and 2 over the period of October 2005 to November 2007. As found by the Court of Appeal of Versailles, Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code criminalising the trafficking in persons was modified by the Law 2007/1631 of November 20, 2007, changing the text of the Article from:         ‘Trafficking in persons is comprised of the recruitment, transportation, harbouring and reception of any person, for financial or other material benefit, to make said personavailable to a third party, even where said third party is not identified, in order to allow the commission of breaches of working or accommodation conditions against the person contrary to their human dignity.’To        ‘Trafficking in persons is the recruitment, transportation, harbouring or welcoming a person, for financial or other non-financial material benefit, in order to make them available to themselves or at the disposal of a third party, being identified or not, to enable to commission against the person of offences against the person resulting from their being subjected to working or accommodation conditions which are contrary to their human dignity.’ As such in the present case, from the period of the October 2005 to September 2008, the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in degrading conditions by the Respondents for their own benefit. Thus, as the Plaintiff had not been put at the disposal of a third party, from the period from October 2005 to November 2007 the Respondents could not be charged with trafficking in persons pursuant to the unamended text of Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code. Rather, the respondents are liable for having committed the lesser offence of subjecting a person to accommodation and work conditions contrary to their human dignity pursuant to Article 225-14 of the Penal Code. The Court of Cassation, held however, that on the facts the respondent had been put at the disposal of a third party. This notwithstanding, from 20 November, 2007 to 21 September, 2008, the Respondents could be prosecuted for having committed trafficking in persons for the period over which the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in conditions contrary to their human dignity for the benefit of the Respondents following the entry into force of the Law 2007/1631 of the 20 November 2007.",drug offences,Not Sentence
"The defendant was accused of facilitating the illegal transit and stay of three Eritrean female migrants (including a minor), who he knew were in France irregularly. The facts occurred on 18 October 2016, between Tende (France) and Nice (France), via La Turbie (Alpes Maritimes, France). The defendant provided transportation and accommodation in his residence to the three irregular migrants.On the afore-mentioned date, the police carried out a traffic control operation in highway A8, close to la Turbie, between 01.00 and 07.00. The defendant was ordered to pull over at approximately 04.45. Authorities realised the defendant was transporting three women, who attempted to hide their faces.The defendant was placed under custody. The search of the vehicle did not reveal anything pertinent to investigations. Later, authorities searched the residence of the defendant, where they found three matrasses placed on the floor and, in the kitchen, nine glasses and bowls as well as a pot with food.Two of the migrants were heard by authorities. One, declared to have fled Eritrea, via the Sahara desert. She went to Sudan and, then, Libya. From there, she left to Italy, by sea, with the assistance of migrant smugglers to whom she paid 3600 USD. She wouldbe attempting to arrive to Germany, where relatives of her resided. She stated to have encountered the defendant by chance, while she and her compatriots where walking towards France. The defendant would have stopped and, realising their tiredness, invited them into the vehicle, without charging them any fees or requesting any advantage in return.The other migrant confirmed the statement of her compatriot. She declared to have paid 3500 USD to be smuggled from Libya into Italy. She would have attempted before to walk towards Germany, in the company of her cousin. However, the latter would have been ran over by a truck and died. On her second attempt, she walked for several days, through the mountains, with her two compatriots. They would be in the process of walking when a vehicle stopped close to them. They asked the driver for help. The defendant accepted to give them a ride without asking any payment or benefit in return.The defendant, in turn, contested the version given by the migrants.  According to him, he had taken charge of the three women in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende (France), upon finding them in an abandoned building close to associations that aimed to provide humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants. He further explained to usually associate with members of such associations/organisations, particularly those intending to supply food and accommodation to migrants in need. He admitted to have witnessed several conversations without ever directly providing humanitarian assistance himself. However, two days before, while he was going to La Brigue to attend a popular celebration with his 12-year old daughter, he notice four young individuals, appearing to be African, and in inappropriate attire in view of the current season. He decided to stop, namely to sensitise his daughter to the difficulties endured by irregular migrants. He ended up conversing with the four young individuals (allegedly from Darfur), who declared to wish to travel to the coast. However, they were heading to the mountains. The defendant agreed to return at approximately 18.00 and help them. He did as agreed. He took the young men to his residence and gave them food and accommodation for the night. The next day, he gave them a ride to the station of Arcs (France) and paid them a train ticket to the station of Carnoules (France). Following these events, he went to work. At the end of the day, he joined some friends in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende (France). One of his friends informed him that a number of associations providing humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants intended to invest on a squat in order to ensure accommodation to those in need. This friend would have told the defendant that he would be helping in this endeavour. The defendant decided to accompany his friend to the site at approximately 01.00. After a while, given the late hour, the defendant manifested his intent to return home. One of the individuals on site, proposed that he took the three Eritrean women to his house and, the following day, gave them a ride to the station of Cagnes-Sur-Mer (France). There, they would take the train to Marseille (France) where they would be expected by doctors and other humanitarian workers. With some hesitation, the defendant accepted. He declared to be fully aware of the irregular situation of the women in France. Yet, he acted out of solidarity in view of their dramatic circumstances. He described that, when he met the women, they were tired, fearful and ‘frozen’. They presented apparent wounds and bandages. One of the three Eritrean women was again questioned, this time confirming the version of events reported by the defendant. The latter’s declarations were also corroborated by the analysis of his phone records. On the one hand, many of the defendant’s contacts were indeed individuals well known for their humanitarian work/involvement. On the other hand, a number of messages were illustrative of the defendant’s intent to help migrants in need, in the sense explained by him during questioning. They further supported the facts reported by the defendant. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence as well as the outcome of search and seizure operations. Expert evidence was also considered. Notably, a physician working with Médecins du Monde attested to the debilitating health conditions of the three Eritrean migrants: (i) they presented contusions, wounds, and sprains due to long hours walking; (ii) most concerning, their psychological state was particularly worrying. The expert further noted to be familiar with the squat in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende, declaring it to be impossible to deny help, food, clothing and accommodation to the migrants settling therein. In addition, the Defence submitted an affidavit from President of the Ligue des droits de l’Homme(who was not heard in court due to time constrains), according to which the actions of the defendant were defined as “gestures of humanity and solidarity towards human beings in situation of total precariousness”. Legal findings:In responding to the humanitarian justification invoked by the Defence, the Public Prosecutor underlined the difference between ‘rescue’ and ‘aide’. The former implies an immediate danger and it is, hence, a duty. The actions of the defendant were to be integrated, instead, within a more organised help/assistance, which was not connected to a real and imminent danger to the life or safety of others.

The migrants slept in their working place, in highly precarious conditions, notably in rooms of 30 square metres total, 2 metres high, no ventilation, no protection against electric cables exposed, no intimacy, two beds only, substandard sanitary conditions. The specific estate they were accommodated in belonged to the enterprise ABL, of which the appellant’s brother is the manager. The latter agreed, on behalf of the company, that the migrants lived in the location. Migrants would work 7-9 hours day (resting on Sundays) and perceived a salary of 800 Euro.The appellant declared, in relation to one migrant, not to be aware of his irregular situation in France. With regard to the other two, the appellant argued that they were simply visiting. This version of events was contradicted by the evidence gathered and, in some instances, by other declarations of the appellant himself. In ascertaining the facts, authorities took into account inter alia testimonial evidence (from both the migrants and the appellant) and the outcome of surveillance and search operations. Legal findings:The Court of Appeal of Metzconvicted the appellant for “assisting the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France”, as well as for concealed work, employing foreigners without a work permit and submitting persons in vulnerable situations to degrading and inhuman accommodation.The Court of Cassation reaffirmed the decision and dismissed the appeal.For further details see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"Defendants A. and Z. (a couple) assisted in the irregular entry and stay of two foreign women in France. During a trip to Senegal, A. recruited Y.

They had tried to acquire a French identity card to the latter by presenting a false certificate of French nationality, copy of fraudulent birth certificate, certificate of loss of identity card as issued by the police, copy of certificate of residence (in an address later determined to be fictitious). The investigations that followed permitted to ascertained as follows:H.F. participated in at least nine similar operations aimed at fraudulently obtaining French identity cards to foreigners. He chose the most appropriate municipalities to carry out the plan. He arranged the logistics and accompanied the foreigners to the police (where they declared to have lost the national identity card so as to gather a corresponding certificate to deliver in the Town Hall), assisting them to collect fraudulent certificates of residence issued by defendant M.H. or an insurance company. H.F. also assisted the foreigner in his or her endeavour in the Town Hall aimed at acquiring national documents in a fraudulent manner. Migrant smuggling activities were carried out in Thiais (France).M.H. participated in at least four operations, in the context of which he supplied falsified certificates of residence. In some instances, he also accompanied the migrants to the Town Hall to assist them in the attempt of acquiring national identity documents. Migrant smuggling activities were carried out in Aubervilliers (France). From the residence of H.F., authorities seized, among other items, a file for the request of a French passport, a certificate of loss of identity card, three replies to requests of birth certificates, 29 extracts of birth certificates, five certificates of French nationality issued to different persons, eight ink-stamps (corresponding to different municipalities) with the writing “certified”. From the residence of M.H., authorities seized inter alia dozens of blank templates of: (i) water invoices, (ii) birth certificates from three municipalities, (iii) blank sheets of paper with the ink-stamp of Town Hall. The appellants acknowledged their participation in the activities above described. In determining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on (i) statements of witnesses and defendants, (ii) interception of communications, (iii) surveillance, searches and seizures. Legal findings:The Court of Nancy(France)convicted the defendant inter alia for migrant smuggling, specifically for procuring and or enabling - in the context of an organised criminal group - the illegal entry, transit and or stay of non EU citizens, in contradiction to EU and domestic law The Appeal Court of Nancy confirmed the decision.

"The appellant O.X. used his professional position in the préfecture of Guyane (France)  - where he dealt with requests for residence permits – to facilitate the fraudulent issuing of administrative documents necessary for foreigners to enter and stay in France. While O.X. did not have the power to decide on requests for residence permit, he manipulated and presented the files to his hierarchy fully aware of mis-representations therein. He acted in this manner for financial or other material gain. A review of his bank accounts revealed abnormal and unjustified operations, notably: 32 500 Euro in May 2007 and 43 700 in April 2007. The appellant tried to justify this income with his gambling endeavours. However, several inconsistencies in that respect remained. Upon searching his residence, authorities discovered several blank certificates of accommodation, a crucial document in the process of requesting a residence permit. Appellant O.X. denied all accusations though admitting to have changed the planning of work and accelerated the schedule of meetings, yet without receiving any gain in exchange.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on searches and seizures, documental and testimonial evidence.  Legal findings:The Court of Appeal of Cayennes (France)convicted the appellants of passive corruption and “assisting the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France”.

"The defendant admitted to have issued certificates of residence in France to several irregular migrants, allegedly without having perceived any financial or other material benefit. He acknowledged to have the same stated “legal residence” as an irregular migrant he assisted but was, nonetheless, unable to provide any information regarding the latter.Upon a search to the defendant’s residence, authorities found his associate (M.Y.) as well as seven irregular migrants in situ. The electricity contract of the apartment was under the defendant’s name. During questioning, M.Y. was unable to explain the provenance of 6000 Euro found in his possession, simply stating the cash had been lent to him by friends so as to enable the purchase of a real estate. In ascertaining the facts, authorities took into account inter alia testimonial evidence and the outcome search and seizure operations. Legal findings:The competent Investigative Judge deemed there to be sufficient evidence to hold the defendant and his associate prima facie responsible for “assisting the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France”.

"Throughout 2008, 2009 and 2010, in French territory, the defendants (W.A.T. and B.E.F.) assisted foreign nationals (at least 13) to irregularly enter, transit or stay in France, notably by: (i) falsifying and using false administrative documents, (ii) being in possession of false administrative documents, (iii) obtaining false documents. The offences were committed through an organised criminal group.  On 6 July 2009, the Sub-Directorate on the Fight against Irregular Migration and the Illegal Work of Foreigners (Sous-direction de la Lutte de l’immigration irrégulière et le travail illégale des étrangers) received an anonymous tip on the existence of a network of irregular migration. Defendant W.A.T. would be involved in it by ensuring the trip and arrival in France of migrants original from Mauritania, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Morocco, some of whom would be minors. As a result, authorities placed the residence of W.A.T. and himself under surveillance. On 9 July 2012, he was observed picking up two seemingly African individuals from the station of Austerlitz (Paris, France), who were arriving from Cerbère (France). The analysis of the data collected through the bugging of his mobile phones, revealed that (i) W.A.T. was often in contact with Morocco, (ii) migrants paid between 2500 and 3000 Euro per person. W.A.T.’s phone number often activated towers in airports Rossy Charles de Gaule and d’Orly (both in France). In August 2009, W.A.T. carried out several return trips between Spain and Morocco.The analysis of his computer data (which had also been bugged), provided evidence on the organisation of trips, recruitment of migrants, and methods used to obtain false documents. Authorities retrieved photographs in passport format, copies of passports, plane tickets reservations. In several emails, W.A.T. acknowledged and confirmed the arrival of several migrants in France, sometimes via Morocco.Electronic surveillance techniques permitted identifying several accomplices/members of the organised criminal group operating: (i) in France (five individual including the defendant B.E.F.) and abroad (four individuals, residing in the United Kingdom and Morocco).From December 2009 on, W.A.T. extended his migrant smuggling activities to Greece’s route. In this context, another accomplice, resident in Belgium, was identified. Physical and electronic surveillance confirmed these developments and attested to the arrival of at least two irregular migrants, via Greece. Conversations involving W.A.T. and his accomplices referred to “app. 20 migrants in Greece waiting for their trip to France”.Under questioning, W.A.T. declared inter alia that new arrivals in Morocco would receive a three months valid stamp on their passport. W.A.T. thus proposed to migrants the stamping of their passports in the terms explained, in exchange of 800 Euro. He declared to authorities that he would receive the payment and disappear before concluding any border crossing. Investigations revealed close connections with a police officer in Morocco. W.A.T. also admitted some involvement in the migrant smuggling venture via Greece. He denied additional criminal facts. B.E.F. was heard on the facts. He declared to be a child friend of W.A.T. He denied being involved in smuggling ventures, though W.A.T. would “have something to do with it”. B.E.F. admitted to facts attested by surveillance techniques, notably having supplied stolen passports and third parties’ passports to W.A.T. He later retracted some of these admissions. His involvement in the activities of the organised criminal group was supported by the declarations of other members thereof. In ascertaining the facts, authorities resorted to electronic surveillance (including interception of communications, computer bugging), searches and seizures, physical surveillance operations, declarations of defendants and witnesses. Legal findings:The defendants were charged by the Prosecution with  “assisting, though an organised criminal group, the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State Party to the Schengen Agreement”. The Court convicted the defendants. B.E.F. was acquitted for events prior to 31 August 2009.For further details see “Commentary”.",drug offences,Not Sentence
"The judgment decides the appeal presented by an individual (D.T.P.) against his conviction for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The appellant was charged with arranging “approximately 30 marriages” with the purpose of obtaining or facilitating the issuance of residence permits in France or the acquisition of French nationality, during the period of 1 January 2002 to 31 January 2007. However, the accusation and appealed sentence refer in detail to 10 marriages from 21 August 2002 to 4 May 2004.The recruitment of French nationals to marry Cameroonian citizens took place in France while the marriages were celebrated in Denmark since the latter’s legislation did not require the presence of the spouses earlier than the day before the wedding.  The recruited brides were paid between 2000 and 4500 Euro. The marriages were organised via the intermediation of an enterprise based in Germany, which, in 2002-2004, perceived a significant increase of marriages between French and Cameroonians. The enterprise charged a fee of 350 Euro per wedding. Its owners declared that the appellant referred to them 1-2 couples per month, for which he received a fee of 50 Euro per marriage.It was ascertained this scheme operated through a number of intermediaries, who recruited the French nationals and transported them to Denmark, to celebrate the wedding, and then back to France. Sometimes they went to Germany to address organisational issues. Their expenses in the course of these events were covered. The appellant was identified as “le Président” of this organisational scheme. Some witnesses indicated the appellant was present in preparatory meetings of the fraudulent marriages and directly engaged in the arrangement thereof. The wife of the appellant declared to have recruited six women on behalf of the defendant to marry African individuals based in Europe. She estimated her husband organised two to five marriages per month (108 to 270 marriages from August 2002 to December 2006). The appellant himself declared to organise such marriages – “approximately 30 from 2002 on – demanding 4000 Euro to the African spouse-to-be. From this amount, 3000 Euro would be for the woman to marry, 500 Euro for the recruiter and 500 Euro for himself. He also acknowledged to have acted as intermediary to the Germany-based enterprise specialised in planning weddings. He continued these activities until the moment of his detention. In determining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on statements of witnesses, individuals who contracted sham marriages, intermediaries in the criminal plan, the defendant. Telephone surveillance techniques were also used. Legal findings:The Court of Rennes(France)convicted the defendant for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The Appeal Court of Rennes overturned the decision and ordered the release of the defendant. For further details see “Commentary”.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"The decision rules on the appeal lodged by two individuals against their conviction inter alia for “assisting in the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner original from other State party to the Schengen Agreement”. The appellants were deemed members of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. Between 2009 and 26 April 2011, the appellants assisted foreigners to irregularly obtain a residence permit in Spain, by presenting false marriage certificates. They recruited French women willing to go through with the scam, accompanied the Tunisian migrants to Spain, and obtained the necessary fraudulent documents.The “wife” firstly enrolled in the registry of foreigners in Spain. The “husband” would later address the same services and request, on the basis of a false marriage certificate, the issuance of a Spanish residence permit. Legal findings:La Juridiction inter-régionale spécialisée de Bordeauxconvicted the defendants of “assisting in the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State party to the Schengen Agreement”.

It was argued against the defendant that the Parish Centre did not fully comply with regulations on public safety and sanitation. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, including from the defendant. Legal findings:The Prosecution demanded a fine of 12 000 Euro. It was argued that the “accommodation policy” favoured by the defendant was an incentive to irregular migration. The Court of First Instance of Saint Étienne acquitted the defendant. For further details see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”. Note: The case against the defendant was not pursued on grounds of migrant smuggling.

"Date(s) of offending: On/from throughout 2011 to 22 November 2011In February 2011, the German police informed OCRIEST (Office central pour la répression de l'immigration irrégulière et de l'emploi d' étrangers sans titre) of the existence of a Vietnamese organized criminal group primordially based and managed in France dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. The defendants were accused of membership in the said organized criminal group, the function of which was to ensure the illegal entry of migrants into the United Kingdom, either via transportation arranged by the criminal network or through the so-called “éco”, “Co”, or“Herbe” method, that is, hiding in lorries without the knowledge of the drivers.Specifically, throughout 2011 and until 22 November of the same year, the defendants operated in the regions of Île de France (France) and Nord Pas de Calais (France). They inter alia (i) procured the entry of migrants in France by purchasing bus, plane and train tickets, fraudulently obtaining visas, arranging for vehicles with drivers; (ii) provided accommodation and food to irregular migrants while awaiting for departure to the United Kingdom; (iii) transported migrants throughout the country as necessary; (iv) helped migrants jumping into lorries heading to the United Kingdom; (v) acted as passeurs.The organized criminal group facilitated irregular migration mostly of Chinese and Vietnamese individuals. As noted earlier, the main goal was to ensure their illegal entry into the United Kingdom. The smuggling venture often implicated passing through Romania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, and or Belgium before reaching France. Migrants left Vietnam by plane and entered Europe mostly via Czech Republic. They followed to France by train (300 Euro) or bus (100 Euro). Once in France, the migrants were received by members of the organized criminal group that arranged for their stay until the moment of departure. In respect of departures via “Co” method, it usually occurred via Calais. Migrants were kept in camps, monitored by smugglers. Conditions in such sites were difficult. Smugglers took from migrants their documentation and mobile phones.Specifically concerning the procurement of documents necessary to enter the European Union, the criminal group used valid documents of Vietnamese with physical resemblance to the migrants in question. To such documents were added visas fraudulently obtained through fictitious invitation letters issued by companies in Eastern Europe (mostly Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania). These visas “cost” 11000 Euro. The organized criminal group sold them to migrants at 13000 Euro. Once in the European Union, irregular migrants were to get rid of their own identity documents and keep only the fraudulent ones. Following June 2011, this modus operandi faced obstacles since embassies in Europe became reluctant to easily issue visas to Chinese nationals.The overall prices of the smuggling venture varied: between 18500 Euro and 20000 Euro – Vietnam to United Kingdom; 14000 Euro – Vietnam to France; between 13000 Euro and 15000 Euro – Vietnam to Czech Republic; 7000 – Czech Republic to France. Sometimes the payment was required before beginning the travel. Other times, migrants were allowed to pay part of the price once in Europe. On occasion, the payment of a deposit was demanded. As for the transfer of funds, migrants usually delivered the payment to small businesses in Vietnam (usually jewelry shops), which wired the money to assigned contacts in Europe.Defendant 9 was deemed the leader of the organized criminal group. Defendants 2 and 4 were his men of trust. The other defendants were intermediaries and middle-men, the functions of whom varied between recruiting irregular migrants in Vietnam, arranging for fraudulent documentation, accommodating migrants, collecting travel “prices”, transporting migrants, etc.Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 did not possess valid documents to enter and stay in France. They were thus accused of illegal entry and stay.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, especially from the irregular migrants and defendants. An interpreter appointed by the court assisted several of them. The defendants essentially denied the accusations held against them or recognized some minor participation therein. This notwithstanding, electronic and physical surveillance as well as searches were crucial in confirming the facts as exposed above.Legal findingsAll defendants were convicted of migrants smuggling in the context of an organised criminal group. Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 were acquitted of illegal entry and stay in national territory. For further details see  “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence

"The plaintiff, a woman of unknown age, established that she had been recruited and subjected to accommodation and work conditions contrary to human dignity by the two Respondents, a married couple for whom she worked, for their material benefit. The Plaintiff states that the Second Respondent had approached her with the promise that, if she came to work in France with the brother of the Second Respondent, she would receive a salary and would be able to follow literacy courses. The plaintiff was thus subjected to accommodation and working conditions which were contrary to her human dignity, as well as forced domestic servitude at the hands of – and for the benefit of - Respondents 1 and 2 over the period of October 2005 to November 2007. As found by the Court of Appeal of Versailles, Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code criminalising the trafficking in persons was modified by the Law 2007/1631 of November 20, 2007, changing the text of the Article from:         ‘Trafficking in persons is comprised of the recruitment, transportation, harbouring and reception of any person, for financial or other material benefit, to make said personavailable to a third party, even where said third party is not identified, in order to allow the commission of breaches of working or accommodation conditions against the person contrary to their human dignity.’To        ‘Trafficking in persons is the recruitment, transportation, harbouring or welcoming a person, for financial or other non-financial material benefit, in order to make them available to themselves or at the disposal of a third party, being identified or not, to enable to commission against the person of offences against the person resulting from their being subjected to working or accommodation conditions which are contrary to their human dignity.’ As such in the present case, from the period of the October 2005 to September 2008, the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in degrading conditions by the Respondents for their own benefit. Thus, as the Plaintiff had not been put at the disposal of a third party, from the period from October 2005 to November 2007 the Respondents could not be charged with trafficking in persons pursuant to the unamended text of Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code. Rather, the respondents are liable for having committed the lesser offence of subjecting a person to accommodation and work conditions contrary to their human dignity pursuant to Article 225-14 of the Penal Code. The Court of Cassation, held however, that on the facts the respondent had been put at the disposal of a third party. This notwithstanding, from 20 November, 2007 to 21 September, 2008, the Respondents could be prosecuted for having committed trafficking in persons for the period over which the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in conditions contrary to their human dignity for the benefit of the Respondents following the entry into force of the Law 2007/1631 of the 20 November 2007.",drug offences,Not Sentence

"The appellant was accused of migrant smuggling in its modality of facilitation of illegal stay. Specifically, he acknowledged to have provided accommodation to several irregular migrants, to whom he issued certificates of domicile. He stressed, however, that he had received no compensation for such acts.The appellant was deemed to be member of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. He lodged with a criminal associate (M.Z.). Seven other men were found in the apartment the appellant and M.Z. shared. M.Z. had been found in possession on 6 000 Euro, the provenance of which he was not able to explain. In view of the circumstances, authorities were convinced they were engaged in migrant smuggling activities. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence and the result of searches and seizures. Legal findings:The Court of Appeal of Reims (France) convicted the appellant of migrant smuggling. The Court of Cassation reversed the decision, determining it should be re-sent to the court a quo for re-trial according to the law. For further details see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"Throughout 2008, 2009 and 2010, in French territory, the defendants (W.A.T. and B.E.F.) assisted foreign nationals (at least 13) to irregularly enter, transit or stay in France, notably by: (i) falsifying and using false administrative documents, (ii) being in possession of false administrative documents, (iii) obtaining false documents. The offences were committed through an organised criminal group.  On 6 July 2009, the Sub-Directorate on the Fight against Irregular Migration and the Illegal Work of Foreigners (Sous-direction de la Lutte de l’immigration irrégulière et le travail illégale des étrangers) received an anonymous tip on the existence of a network of irregular migration. Defendant W.A.T. would be involved in it by ensuring the trip and arrival in France of migrants original from Mauritania, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Morocco, some of whom would be minors. As a result, authorities placed the residence of W.A.T. and himself under surveillance. On 9 July 2012, he was observed picking up two seemingly African individuals from the station of Austerlitz (Paris, France), who were arriving from Cerbère (France). The analysis of the data collected through the bugging of his mobile phones, revealed that (i) W.A.T. was often in contact with Morocco, (ii) migrants paid between 2500 and 3000 Euro per person. W.A.T.’s phone number often activated towers in airports Rossy Charles de Gaule and d’Orly (both in France). In August 2009, W.A.T. carried out several return trips between Spain and Morocco.The analysis of his computer data (which had also been bugged), provided evidence on the organisation of trips, recruitment of migrants, and methods used to obtain false documents. Authorities retrieved photographs in passport format, copies of passports, plane tickets reservations. In several emails, W.A.T. acknowledged and confirmed the arrival of several migrants in France, sometimes via Morocco.Electronic surveillance techniques permitted identifying several accomplices/members of the organised criminal group operating: (i) in France (five individual including the defendant B.E.F.) and abroad (four individuals, residing in the United Kingdom and Morocco).From December 2009 on, W.A.T. extended his migrant smuggling activities to Greece’s route. In this context, another accomplice, resident in Belgium, was identified. Physical and electronic surveillance confirmed these developments and attested to the arrival of at least two irregular migrants, via Greece. Conversations involving W.A.T. and his accomplices referred to “app. 20 migrants in Greece waiting for their trip to France”.Under questioning, W.A.T. declared inter alia that new arrivals in Morocco would receive a three months valid stamp on their passport. W.A.T. thus proposed to migrants the stamping of their passports in the terms explained, in exchange of 800 Euro. He declared to authorities that he would receive the payment and disappear before concluding any border crossing. Investigations revealed close connections with a police officer in Morocco. W.A.T. also admitted some involvement in the migrant smuggling venture via Greece. He denied additional criminal facts. B.E.F. was heard on the facts. He declared to be a child friend of W.A.T. He denied being involved in smuggling ventures, though W.A.T. would “have something to do with it”. B.E.F. admitted to facts attested by surveillance techniques, notably having supplied stolen passports and third parties’ passports to W.A.T. He later retracted some of these admissions. His involvement in the activities of the organised criminal group was supported by the declarations of other members thereof. In ascertaining the facts, authorities resorted to electronic surveillance (including interception of communications, computer bugging), searches and seizures, physical surveillance operations, declarations of defendants and witnesses. Legal findings:The defendants were charged by the Prosecution with  “assisting, though an organised criminal group, the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State Party to the Schengen Agreement”. The Court convicted the defendants. B.E.F. was acquitted for events prior to 31 August 2009.For further details see “Commentary”.",drug offences,Not Sentence
"The judgment decides the appeal presented by an individual (D.T.P.) against his conviction for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The appellant was charged with arranging “approximately 30 marriages” with the purpose of obtaining or facilitating the issuance of residence permits in France or the acquisition of French nationality, during the period of 1 January 2002 to 31 January 2007. However, the accusation and appealed sentence refer in detail to 10 marriages from 21 August 2002 to 4 May 2004.The recruitment of French nationals to marry Cameroonian citizens took place in France while the marriages were celebrated in Denmark since the latter’s legislation did not require the presence of the spouses earlier than the day before the wedding.  The recruited brides were paid between 2000 and 4500 Euro. The marriages were organised via the intermediation of an enterprise based in Germany, which, in 2002-2004, perceived a significant increase of marriages between French and Cameroonians. The enterprise charged a fee of 350 Euro per wedding. Its owners declared that the appellant referred to them 1-2 couples per month, for which he received a fee of 50 Euro per marriage.It was ascertained this scheme operated through a number of intermediaries, who recruited the French nationals and transported them to Denmark, to celebrate the wedding, and then back to France. Sometimes they went to Germany to address organisational issues. Their expenses in the course of these events were covered. The appellant was identified as “le Président” of this organisational scheme. Some witnesses indicated the appellant was present in preparatory meetings of the fraudulent marriages and directly engaged in the arrangement thereof. The wife of the appellant declared to have recruited six women on behalf of the defendant to marry African individuals based in Europe. She estimated her husband organised two to five marriages per month (108 to 270 marriages from August 2002 to December 2006). The appellant himself declared to organise such marriages – “approximately 30 from 2002 on – demanding 4000 Euro to the African spouse-to-be. From this amount, 3000 Euro would be for the woman to marry, 500 Euro for the recruiter and 500 Euro for himself. He also acknowledged to have acted as intermediary to the Germany-based enterprise specialised in planning weddings. He continued these activities until the moment of his detention. In determining the facts, authorities relied inter alia on statements of witnesses, individuals who contracted sham marriages, intermediaries in the criminal plan, the defendant. Telephone surveillance techniques were also used. Legal findings:The Court of Rennes(France)convicted the defendant for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The Appeal Court of Rennes overturned the decision and ordered the release of the defendant. For further details see “Commentary”.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"The decision rules on the appeal lodged by two individuals against their conviction inter alia for “assisting in the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner original from other State party to the Schengen Agreement”. The appellants were deemed members of an organised criminal group dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. Between 2009 and 26 April 2011, the appellants assisted foreigners to irregularly obtain a residence permit in Spain, by presenting false marriage certificates. They recruited French women willing to go through with the scam, accompanied the Tunisian migrants to Spain, and obtained the necessary fraudulent documents.The “wife” firstly enrolled in the registry of foreigners in Spain. The “husband” would later address the same services and request, on the basis of a false marriage certificate, the issuance of a Spanish residence permit. Legal findings:La Juridiction inter-régionale spécialisée de Bordeauxconvicted the defendants of “assisting in the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State party to the Schengen Agreement”. The Court of Appeal of Bordeaux confirmed the appealed decision but increased the length of the penalty of interdiction from the French territory.For further details see “Commentary”.",drug offences,Sentenced
"Date(s) of offending: On/from throughout 2011 to 22 November 2011In February 2011, the German police informed OCRIEST (Office central pour la répression de l'immigration irrégulière et de l'emploi d' étrangers sans titre) of the existence of a Vietnamese organized criminal group primordially based and managed in France dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. The defendants were accused of membership in the said organized criminal group, the function of which was to ensure the illegal entry of migrants into the United Kingdom, either via transportation arranged by the criminal network or through the so-called “éco”, “Co”, or“Herbe” method, that is, hiding in lorries without the knowledge of the drivers.Specifically, throughout 2011 and until 22 November of the same year, the defendants operated in the regions of Île de France (France) and Nord Pas de Calais (France). They inter alia (i) procured the entry of migrants in France by purchasing bus, plane and train tickets, fraudulently obtaining visas, arranging for vehicles with drivers; (ii) provided accommodation and food to irregular migrants while awaiting for departure to the United Kingdom; (iii) transported migrants throughout the country as necessary; (iv) helped migrants jumping into lorries heading to the United Kingdom; (v) acted as passeurs.The organized criminal group facilitated irregular migration mostly of Chinese and Vietnamese individuals. As noted earlier, the main goal was to ensure their illegal entry into the United Kingdom. The smuggling venture often implicated passing through Romania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, and or Belgium before reaching France. Migrants left Vietnam by plane and entered Europe mostly via Czech Republic. They followed to France by train (300 Euro) or bus (100 Euro). Once in France, the migrants were received by members of the organized criminal group that arranged for their stay until the moment of departure. In respect of departures via “Co” method, it usually occurred via Calais. Migrants were kept in camps, monitored by smugglers. Conditions in such sites were difficult. Smugglers took from migrants their documentation and mobile phones.Specifically concerning the procurement of documents necessary to enter the European Union, the criminal group used valid documents of Vietnamese with physical resemblance to the migrants in question. To such documents were added visas fraudulently obtained through fictitious invitation letters issued by companies in Eastern Europe (mostly Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania). These visas “cost” 11000 Euro. The organized criminal group sold them to migrants at 13000 Euro. Once in the European Union, irregular migrants were to get rid of their own identity documents and keep only the fraudulent ones. Following June 2011, this modus operandi faced obstacles since embassies in Europe became reluctant to easily issue visas to Chinese nationals.The overall prices of the smuggling venture varied: between 18500 Euro and 20000 Euro – Vietnam to United Kingdom; 14000 Euro – Vietnam to France; between 13000 Euro and 15000 Euro – Vietnam to Czech Republic; 7000 – Czech Republic to France. Sometimes the payment was required before beginning the travel. Other times, migrants were allowed to pay part of the price once in Europe. On occasion, the payment of a deposit was demanded. As for the transfer of funds, migrants usually delivered the payment to small businesses in Vietnam (usually jewelry shops), which wired the money to assigned contacts in Europe.Defendant 9 was deemed the leader of the organized criminal group. Defendants 2 and 4 were his men of trust. The other defendants were intermediaries and middle-men, the functions of whom varied between recruiting irregular migrants in Vietnam, arranging for fraudulent documentation, accommodating migrants, collecting travel “prices”, transporting migrants, etc.Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 did not possess valid documents to enter and stay in France. They were thus accused of illegal entry and stay.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, especially from the irregular migrants and defendants. An interpreter appointed by the court assisted several of them. The defendants essentially denied the accusations held against them or recognized some minor participation therein. This notwithstanding, electronic and physical surveillance as well as searches were crucial in confirming the facts as exposed above.Legal findingsAll defendants were convicted of migrants smuggling in the context of an organised criminal group. Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 were acquitted of illegal entry and stay in national territory. For further details see  “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence

"This case concerns the defendant Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, one of the leaders of a transnational network that facilitated computer intrusions, fraudulent schemes, and money laundering. The defendant was a Nigerian national and resident of the United Arab Emirates at the time of offending.From January 2019 to June 2020, the defendant conspired with multiple other persons to conduct financial transactions into, within, and outside the United States involving property that represented the proceeds of wire fraud. The co-conspirators targeted multiple victims and laundered and/or attempted to launder funds fraudulently obtained, as well as attempted to fraudulently obtain funds, through bank cyber-heists, business email compromise (“BEC”) frauds, and other fraud schemes. In December 2019, the defendant began conspiring with a co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator A”) to defraud a businessperson, who was seeking a lender to invest USD 15,000,000 in a project to build an international school. The defendant began communicating with the businessperson using an alias and promised to assist in opening a bank account in the United States, where the loan could be deposited. The defendant arranged for another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator B”) to open a bank account at Wells Fargo Bank in Canoga Park, California in the name of a Qatari company, and file a fictitious business name statement in order to register a fictitious business entity. Subsequently, the defendant directed a co-conspirator in Nigeria (“Co-conspirator C”) to create a false and fraudulent power of attorney bearing the name of the Qatari company.  The defendant then forwarded the bank information and power of attorney to the businessperson. The defendant and Co-Conspirator A each corresponded with the businessperson to fraudulently induce the businessperson to pay approximately USD 330,000 to fund the opening of a purported “investor’s account” in order to facilitate the transfer of the USD 15,000,000 loan they promised the businessperson. The defendant himself directed the businessperson to make wire transfers of USD 230,000 to the Wells Fargo bank account of a luxury watch-seller and USD 100,000 to a Capital One bank account of another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator D”), which the businessperson did.The defendant used these funds for his personal benefit, and none of the funds were used as promised to the businessperson. The defendant used the wire transfer of USD 230,000 to purchase a luxury Richard Mille RM11-03 watch and arranged for the watch-seller to have the watch available in the New York metropolitan area, where Co-conspirator D picked it up.  Co-conspirator D and another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator E”) arranged to have the watch delivered to a different co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator F”), who was directed by the defendant to transport the watch to the United Arab Emirates in January 2020.The defendant further directed Co-conspirator D to withdraw the USD 100,000 transferred to her and convert a portion of them - minus USD 8,000 as payment for Co-conspirator D – to the Nigerian currency, which she would then send to co-conspirators who would deliver the funds to the defendant using transfers between Nigerian bank accounts. The defendant also arranged to have Co-conspirator D send cashier’s checks of USD 40,000 and USD 10,000 to another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator G”) who would use the funds to obtain St. Christopher (St. Kitts) and Nevis’ citizenship and a passport for the defendant, which he received in February 2020.In January and February 2020, the defendant and Co-conspirator A corresponded with the businessperson, attempting to fraudulently induce the businessperson to pay USD 575,000 in purported “taxes” to release the loan. In February, the businessperson wire transferred approximately USD 300,000 to bank accounts in Kenya.In the beginning of March 2020, the defendant further fraudulently induced the businessperson to send additional wire transfers to U.S. bank accounts, namely USD 100,000 to Co-conspirator D and USD 80,000 to a different co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator H”). The funds from these payments were subsequently laundered through a variety of means, with the assistance of Co-conspirators D, E, G, and H.The defendant later admitted to the following approximate actual or intended loss amounts, foreseeable to him, in connection with the victims identified:- Foreign Financial Institution: approximately USD 14,700,000.00; - Victim Companies in the U.K.: approximately USD 7,740,000.00;  - Victim Law Firm: USD 922,857.76;  - and Victim Businessperson and Qatari Victim Company: USD 809,983.58.The defendant was arrested by U.A.E. law enforcement officials in June 2020.

He was sentenced to over eleven years in prison and ordered to pay USD 1,732,841 in restitution to two fraud victims in November 2022.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"The defendant, Ruben Andre Garcia, engaged in coercion, force, and fraud to cause women to engage in commercial sex acts. Specifically, between 2013 and 2019, he recruited young women to participate in commercial sex act videos, which were later posted on pornography websites, GirlsDoPorn (GDP), GirlsDoToys (GDT), and PornHub, without the women’s consent. He duped the women by making false representations that the videos would not be posted online, made available in the U.S., or be seen by anyone the women knew.Several other co-conspirators (Michael James Pratt, Matthew Isaac Wolfe, Theodore Wilfred Gyi, Valorie Moser, and others) participated in the sex trafficking conspiracy. The defendant, and a co-conspirator (Pratt), also a recruiter, posted fake advertisements online on Craigslist (an online classified advertisement website) for modeling jobs. To convince the victims responding to the advertisements to participate in the filming of pornographic videos, the defendant, Pratt and other co-conspirators had other women, who were paid a fee for recruitment efforts and each time a victim agreed to be filmed, contact victims to assure them that the videos would not be made available online, in the U.S., or to anyone they know. Victims complained about painful sex acts requesting that filming stop, to no avail, and were frequently threatened with lawsuits and the posting of their videos online, the cancelation of tickets for their flights home, and the blocking of the victims’ exit from the hotel rooms with equipment where they were filming the videos to make the women feel that they could not leave.The defendant pleaded guilty to “conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion” and “sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion.” For his crimes, the defendant received 240 months’ imprisonment.Two of the defendant’s co-conspirators (Gyi and Moser) each pled guilty to “conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion”.

"This case regards the defendant’s involvement in a computer-based intrusion fraud scheme. A chief financial officer of one company, namely Unatrac Holding Limited, received an email that purportedly contained a web link to the Microsoft Office 365 login page. The victim, having an email account with this host, trusted the link and viewed it as legitimate. After clicking on the link he received in the phishing email, the page he was sent to resembled the Microsoft Office 365 login page. For this reason, the chief financial officer input his login credentials, which unbeknownst to him, were captured by criminals, including the defendant, who then used this information to access his account. His email account was then used to send fraudulent emails requesting wire transfers from other members of the company’s financial team. What is more, having observed company policy and the internal practice of forwarding emails from vendors, the perpetrator forwarded a fictitious email he had created to make it look as if a vendor was sending an invoice.

After law enforcement observed the defendant collecting the package and bringing the package into his residence, they executed a search warrant for the residence of the defendant.  During the search of the defendant’s residence, they found and seized different forms of illicit drugs, as well as a firearm and ammunition. The defendant revealed to law enforcement authorities that the illicit drugs were purchased via the Empire Market darknet site. The defendant also revealed that he facilitated the purchase of illicit drugs with Bitcoins and used his cell phone and phone applications like Snapchat to communicate with co-conspirators and otherwise facilitate drug trafficking. The court documents further reveal that Byrnes had a previous infraction in April 2019, wherein law enforcement likewise confiscated narcotics and a firearm. He  ultimately pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 5 years and 11 months’ imprisonment.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"This case involved Bryan Connor Herrell, an “employee” of the dark net site “AlphaBay” who was involved in moderating thousands of illegal transactions under various monikers, including “Penissmith” and “Botah.” From 2016 through July 2017 AlphaBay was the world’s largest online black market, and shortly before its shut down in 2017 it hosted approximately 368,810 listings for the sale of various illicit goods, approximately 350,000 active buyer accounts, and over 9,000 active vendor accounts.AlphaBay was created by Alexandre Cazes, who was prosecuted separately before committing suicide while in custody, in or around July 2014. The marketplace was designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. Numerous vendors used AlphaBay to distribute controlled substances and illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars gained from these illegal transactions. At the time of writing, the site is known to have facilitated the distribution in excess of 90kg of heroin, 450kg of cocaine, and 45kg of methamphetamine.The only way to access AlphaBay was through The Onion Router (“Tor”) network. This network anonymized the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of its underlying servers and allowed vendors and buyers to hide their true identities. Additional measures were also taken to keep identities hidden as AlphaBay required its users to transact in digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum, and did not allow for transactions in official, government-backed currencies. By only accepting digital currencies, AlphaBay and its users were able to bypass the traditional financial systems. AlphaBay was set up like a conventional e-commerce website as a search tool allowed users to choose the type of illegal goods or services they wished to purchase, and users were able to sign up for free by choosing a screen name and password for their account. Furthermore, users could also search by price ranges, popularity of items, vendors, origin or shipping country, and payment types.The defendant Herrell and other co-conspirators (both known and unknown to the Grand Jury) were members and associates of AlphaBay. The marketplace operated as criminal enterprise with “employees” serving as security administrators, moderators, public relations specialists, and scam watchers (whose primary duty is to identify and remove fraudulent listings), meaning that leaders, members, and associates of AlphaBay had defined roles in the organization. The defendant in this case held the position of moderator from about May 2016 through July 2017. As moderator, Herrell had access to portions of the AlphaBay platform that were not available to the general public and had the authority to refund payments from buyers on the website, restore a user’s access to the site, engage in staff-only discussions and meetings, and view the amount of digital currency available to other members of the AlphaBay organization. Moderators also held the responsibility of moderating disputes between buyers and vendors on AlphaBay. For his work as a moderator, Herrell was paid four bitcoins per week (bitcoin was worth about USD 2,000 per coin in May 2016, and about USD 2,600 in July 2017). Through moderating disputes, the defendant Herrell had full visibility and awareness of the criminal activities occurring on AlphaBay and therefore held a role in directly facilitating these criminal activities. In addition, Herrell also held the position of scam watcher from around August 2015 to December 2015, where he monitored and quashed phishing attempts and other scams being carried out on AlphaBay. Herrell was also paid in bitcoin for this work.In 2017, Bryan Connor Herrell was indicted on the felony crime of Conspiracy to Engage in Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, USD 250,000 criminal fine, and up to 3 years supervised release. Additionally, upon conviction of this offence, Herrell also was subject to a forfeiture of property pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1963(a)(1) - (a)(3). Herrell entered into a plea agreement and was sentenced to 11 years in prison in September 2020. The following assets were forfeited: one cryptocurrency wallet containing approximately one Bitcoin, an assortment of counterfeit “Magic: The Gathering” and sports collectible cards, approximately USD 745.00 in U.S. currency, 139 gold coins (one ounce each), 8 silver dollar coins (one ounce each), one USD 1,000 bill encased in hard plastic, and one German August Schwer Cuckoo clock.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"This case involves the sentencing of a Russian national who operated two websites facilitating payment card fraud, computer hacking, and other crimes.According to the official documents, the defendant, Aleksei Burkov, operated a website called “Card Planet,” which offered stolen credit card data that had been obtained mostly through computer intrusion. There were hundreds of thousands of victims, many of them U.S. citizens. Over 150,000 stolen credit card numbers from over 1,300 banks were offered for purchase. Regarding cards of U.S. accounts alone, this resulted in over USD 20 million in fraudulent purchases.In addition, the defendant operated another website, which was invite-only, where elite cybercriminals could advertise stolen goods (i.e. personal identification data), malicious software, and criminal services, including money laundering and hacking services. To obtain membership, prospective members needed three existing members to “vouch” for them and pay a sum of money, usually USD 5,000, as insurance. These measures were aimed at avoid detection from law enforcement authorities as well as guaranteeing that their members valued the deals made on the website. To the same end, the forum removed arrested members from the site by banning them to prevent law enforcement agencies from using the arrested member and/or arrested member’s details to access the site.The defendant was arrested at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel, in December 2015. On 4 February 2016, the defendant was charged with conspiring to commit access device fraud (included in two counts), identity theft, computer intrusion, wire fraud (included in two counts), and money laundering, as well as with access device fraud and wire fraud in a superseding indictment. In 2017, an Israeli district court approved the extradition of the defendant to the United States. After the denial of the defendant’s appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli High Court of Justice, the defendant was finally extradited on 11 November 2019. On 23 January 2020, The defendant pleaded guilty to one count of access device fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, identity theft, computer intrusions, wire fraud, and money laundering on 23 January 2020. The judge sentenced him to nine years’ imprisonment on 26 June 2020.",drug offences,Not Sentence
"This case involves several offences, including conspiracy, smuggling cultural property into the U.S., obstruction of justice, and citizenship and naturalization fraud, committed by the defendant Ijaz Khan with the assistance of several co-conspirators. In 2002, the co-conspirator Vera Lautt travelled to Pakistan to meet Ijaz Khan, whom she had met online, and to sign marriage documents. Subsequently, they both submitted fraudulent documents to the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), facilitating the immigration and later naturalization of Ijaz Khan. The defendant Ijaz Khan was, however, still married to a Pakistani woman, with whom he had and continued to have children, at the time of and after signing the marriage documents. According to the indictment, Ijaz Khan used his citizenship to enable the immigration and later naturalization of his four oldest sons. He divorced Lautt before the children had arrived in the United States. He further filed or assisted with petitions on behalf of his brother, Ibar Khan, his Pakistani wife, his mother, and another two children.Following his immigration from approximately 2007 until May 2014, Ijaz and Fahad Khan, together with others, conspired to smuggle cultural artifacts (e.g., coins, pottery, arrowheads and bronze weapons) that were stolen from burial sites from Pakistan into the United States. The defendant used his company, Indus Valley, to sell the stolen cultural artifacts to his existing customer base, in person at shows, and online (on websites and auction sites, like eBay).In October 2013, a shipment was inspected and seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Subsequently, Ijaz and Fahad Khan, together with their co-conspirator John Bryan McNamara, conspired to submit fraudulent documents purporting to be from the Pakistan government authorizing his export of the cultural artifacts and certifying the value of objects. McNamara had previously pleaded guilty to smuggling the artifacts into the U.S. and making false statements to special agents when interrogated about this shipment.The defendant was identified as the leader and organizer of an organized criminal group made up of family members (e.g., wife and sons) and others who were not related to the defendant (e.g., McNamara). He played a central role in planning and operations, recruitment of accomplices, and controlled and exercised authority over others in the group. Because of his central leadership role, he received a sentencing enhancement, which he unsuccessfully appealed. The defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, a fine of approximately USD 115,000, and was required to forfeit more than 1,300 cultural artifacts. The defendant unsuccessfully appealed his conviction and sentence to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.Others in the organized criminal group pleaded guilty and were also sentenced for their roles in the conspiracy to commit smuggling, including Vera Lautt and John Bryan McNamara, who received four months’ imprisonment (and two years’ supervised release from prison) and two years of probation, respectively.",drug offences,Sentenced
"A group of five defendants participated in a worldwide ponzi scheme, the BitClub Network, which defrauded cryptocurrency investors. The BitClub Network required membership fees, “solicited money from investors in exchange for shares of pooled investments in cryptocurrency mining,” and “rewarded existing investors for recruiting new investors.” The funds provided by investors were purportedly required to sustain the cryptocurrency mining pools by, for example, purchasing equipment and computing power. The profits made by investors supposedly depended on the success of the mining pool operations and the number of shares investors had in the mining pools. To lure investors, keep existing investors, and get investors to provide money, the defendants fraudulently represented earnings. The group fraudulently “obtained at least [USD]… 722 million from investors.” The BCN shares sold were not registered as “securities” with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as required by law. Two of the five defendants pled guilty: Joseph Frank Abel pled guilty to “conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities” and Silviu Catalin Balaci to “conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to offer and sell unregistered securities.” At the time of writing, the remaining three defendants (Matthew Brent Goettsche, Russ Albert Medlin, Jobadiah Sinclair Weeks) have not yet been tried.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"The organized criminal group involved in this case perpetrated several cybercrimes, one of which was online auction fraud. According to the indictment, this fraud was perpetrated by members of the group by posting “hundreds or thousands of listings for automobiles, motorcycles, and other high-priced goods on eBay and similar auction sites.” The images of the items being sold that were included in these postings were infected with malware (i.e., the Bayrob Trojan). When individuals clicked on the images of the items, their devices were infected with the malware, which was designed to redirect these individuals to webpages that looked identical to the legitimate websites of the auction sites. For example, their fake eBay pages included the trademark of the organization and had a similar layout, design, and style of the legitimate eBay webpages with an important key difference. The fake eBay webpages prompted users to pay for the auctioned items using something called an “eBay escrow agent,” which does not exist on the legitimate platform. This purported service claimed to hold the money of the buyer in escrow until the item was received and the buyer was satisfied with the condition of the item delivered before the buyer’s funds were released to the seller. The webpages also included a live chat function that supposedly enabled individuals to speak with customer service agents of eBay; of course, these were not real eBay customer service agents, they were members of the group. The victims of this online auction fraud never received the items they paid for and never received a refund for the money they paid for the non-delivered items.One of the defendants (T.D.) pled guilty to aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy offences relating to wire fraud and money laundering, and received 10 years imprisonment for his crimes. B.N. and R.M. were charged, convicted, and sentenced to 20 and 18 years’ imprisonment, respectively, for aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy offences relating to wire fraud and money laundering, as well as conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit service marks.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator Brandon Arias used the moniker “The Drug Llama” on a vendor account on Dream Market (a Darknet site) to sell counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl. Melissa Scanlan was responsible for sourcing the drugs that would be sold using via the vendor account, while Brandon Arias was responsible for receiving and fulfilling Darknet drug orders, as well as the management of the account. Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator received fentanyl and other narcotics from Mexico, predominantly from Fausto Ramirez and another (unnamed) member of the Mexican cartel. After Melissa Scanlan and Brandon Arias sold the drugs, they kept a portion of the proceeds and gave the remaining criminal proceeds to couriers (usually Norma Dominguez and April Kelly, both females). The couriers would transport the proceeds across U.S.-Mexican border and deliver them to Fausto Ramirez and another member of a Mexican cartel. In one year alone, an estimated 52,000 counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl pills were sold.Melissa Scanlan was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, misbranding of drugs, international money laundering conspiracy, and distribution of fentanyl resulting in death. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 13 years and 4 months’ imprisonment.Brandon Arias was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, and misbranding of drugs.

"This case involves Gary Davis, a member of the small administrative “staff” of the Darknet marketplace “Silk Road.” During its operation from 2011 until 2013, Silk Road was used to distribute illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to more than 100,000 buyers, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of proceeds of these illicit transactions.From June to 2 October 2013, Davis, also known under his alias “Libertas,” worked as a site administrator on Silk Road. He was responsible for responding to customer support requests regarding the need for assistance with buyer or seller accounts, serving as an arbitrator by resolving disputes between drug dealers and their customers, and enforcing the rules for doing business on Silk Road, such as the rule against out of escrow sales. Davis was paid a weekly salary for his administrative services on the marketplace.Shortly after law enforcement authorities had shut down Silk Road in October 2013, its virtually identical successor, Silk Road 2.0, emerged. Davis also served as an administrator for the successor website from November to December 2013.The defendant, along with two of his co-conspirators, was charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy on 19 December 2013. Davis was arrested in Ireland in January 2014 and extradited to the United States in July 2018. Davis pleaded guilty to narcotics trafficking conspiracy on 5 October 2018 and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release on 25 July 2019. He was further ordered to forfeit USD 25,000. At the time of writing, no official information is available on the convictions of his co-defendants, Andrew Michael Jones and Peter Phillip Nash.",drug offences,Sentenced
"The defendant, Mr Gary Davis (aka “Libertas”) worked for the Silk Road website from June 2013 until 2 October 2013 (when the website was shutdown).Silk Road was an online black market created by Mr Ross Ulbricht where a wide range of illegal goods and services could be bought and sold. The platform resembled other online market places in that it required a username and password to log in, offered users a “shopping cart”, and had other like features). A variety of illicit drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy, and opioids were available for purchase on the website. The drugs purchased on Silk Road caused real harm—drugs purchased on Silk Road resulted in six deaths for overdose (though there is no suggestion that Mr Davis was responsible for any of these deaths). Counterfeit and fraudulent identity documents were also available for sale on the website—including, for instance, counterfeit US and foreign passports, US and foreign drivers’ licenses, and social security cards. Computer hacking tools and services were also available for purchase on Silk Road, including password hacking tools and services, Remote Access Tools (RAT) which allows users to obtain unauthorised remote access to a compromised computer, keyloggers which permit a user to monitor keystrokes inputted by a victim into his or her computer and used to steal confidential information, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) services which disable websites or other publicly available services on the Internet by using large networks of compromised computers to flood victim systems with malicious internet traffic. Finally, Silk Road offered money laundering services to its users, many of which were directly marketed to vendors who sold goods or services on the website. Money laundering services aimed at converting proceeds of illegal transactions (obtained in Bitcoin, the required means of payment on the Silk Road website) into other forms of currency. Vendors in this category offered, among other things, the sale of US currency, anonymous debit cards preloaded with currency and other prepaid payment systems, such as Moneypak cards.Silk Road was only accessible through the Tor network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed round the work and designed to conceal the true IP of the computers on the network and, thereby, the identities of users.The required and only payment system on Silk Road was Bitcoin—an entirely electronic currency, not issued by any bank or state, generated and controlled automatically through computer software operating on a peer-to-peer network, and operated through blockchain stored on the peer-to-peer network. On Silk Road, every user had one (or more) Silk Road Bitcoin address associated with their own Silk Road account. The Bitcoin address could be used by each user to deposit funds into their Silk Road account. These addresses were stored on “wallet” files maintained on computer servers controlled by Mr Ulbricht. To make purchases on the website, therefore, a user had to first obtain Bitcoin (for example, from a Bitcoin exchanger) and send these to a Bitcoin address associated with the user’s Silk Road account. Once the purchase took place, the funds were debited from the user’s Silk Road account and held in escrow in a wallet file maintained by Silk Road pending completion of the transaction. Once the transaction was completed the vendor’s Silk Road account would be credited with the payment minus the commission Silk Road took on the sale (8–15% of the transaction). The vendor would then withdraw the Bitcoins from his Silk Road account by transferring them to an outside Bitcoin address, such as the address of a Bitcoin exchanger who would cash out the Bitcoins for real currency. The vendors would also convert their Bitcoins into other currencies, by using money laundering services offered on the website.Silk Road would also use a so-called “tumbler” to hinder the tracking of individual transactions through the blockchain. In a nutshell, the “tumbler” would obscure any link between both the buyer’s and the vendor’s Bitcoin addresses. It would, therefore, make the use of blockchain to follow the money trail useless, even if both the vendor’s and buyer’s Bitcoin addresses were known.Mr Ulbricht ran the website with some support staff (they were four when Silk Road was shutdown by law enforcement on 2 October 2013), who were divided into forum moderators and site administrators. Forum moderators were responsible for, among other things, monitoring user activity on discussion forums associated with the site, providing guidance to forum users concerning how to conduct business on Silk Road, and reporting any significant problems discussed on the forums to the site administrators and Mr Ulbricht. Site administrators were in charge of responding to customer support requests from Silk Road users who needed assistance with their buyer or seller accounts; investigating disputes that arose between vendors and buyers, including reporting their findings to Mr Andrew Michael Jones (another site administrator) or Mr Ulbricht; and helping enforce the rules for doing business on Silk Road. This last responsibility included demoting vendors or referring them to Mr Ulbricht for further discipline. This could happen when vendors and buyers would communicate on Silk Road and decide to conclude the sale offsite to avoid paying to Silk Road a commission (this was called “out of escrow” sales).Mr Gary Davis first worked for a month as a forum moderator of Silk Road. He then was “promoted” to site administrator. As a site administrator, he demoted an account that was likely compromised by the police and posted some posts on the forum advising users how to conceal their true identities. When Silk Road was shut down by law enforcement on 2 October 2013, Mr Davis helped with the launch of “Silk Road 2.0”, a website which was created in the month following Silk Road’s demise. Mr Davis used his credibility with the original Silk Road community to vouch for the new website. He worked on the new version of Silk Road as a site administrator for one month, until he was arrested in Ireland in January 2014.Mr Davis was extradited from Ireland to the US in July 2018. He pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to traffic a controlled substance (narcotics). He was sentenced to six years and six months’ imprisonment on 25 July 2019.",drug offences,Sentenced
"Between 2015 and 2017, the defendant Sergiy Petrovich Usatyuk and a co-conspirator deployed booter services for financial gain, allowing paying users to utilize their services to launch DDoS attacks. Specifically, the defendant and the co-conspirator developed software and created, controlled, and operated a website and infrastructure (e.g., domain names and servers in the U.S. and Romania) to enable paying users to deploy DDoS attacks. One of the most popular booter services used included ExoStresser. Other services offered included Betabooter, Databooter, DecafeStresser, Instabooter, IP Booters, IP Stressors, Polystress, QuezStresser, and Zstress. The booter services the defendant provided along with his co-conspirator were used to conduct 1,367,610 DDoS attacks against systems inside and outside of the United States. These DDoS attacks not only caused harm to the computer systems directly targeted, but also caused harm to computers systems not directly targeted by the attacks. The defendant and the co-conspirator also created and maintained the payment and cryptocurrency accounts needed to obtain the proceeds of crime. The defendant and co-conspirators further engaged in tactics to conceal their identities and activities. In 2019, the defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to cause damage to protected computers. That same year, the defendant was sentenced to 13 months’ imprisonment and three years of supervised release following the completion of the sentence.

"This case involved a sextortion scheme perpetrated by inmates in the South Carolina Department of Corrections, as well as co-conspirators outside of the prison, against U.S. military personnel. In this sextortion scheme, the inmates, using smartphones they smuggled into the prison, signed up for dating apps and targeted U.S. military members utilizing these apps. The defendants and co-conspirators created fake profiles of women using images that they found online. After contacting the targets and obtaining personal information from them, the inmates would send naked images of the person they were impersonating (images which were also found online) and request that the targets provide nude images. The inmates would then call the targets impersonating the father of the person the targets were in contact with (i.e., the women in the profile). The inmates would proceed to misinform the targets that they were communicating with a minor and that what the targets had in their possession (i.e., the naked image) was considered child sexual abuse material. The inmates would then threaten to contact the authorities and report the individuals if money was not paid to the “victim”. The targets were directed to pay these fees using wire transfers via Western Union, MoneyGram, Walmart, and PayPal. The inmates recruited money mules, who received the wire transfers from the military members and would then send the funds to the inmates as directed.The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, extortion, and money laundering. Several of the defendants pled guilty. Specifically, Tiffany Reed pled guilty and was sentenced to three years’ probation for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Another defendant, Wendell Wilkins, also pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, but has yet to be sentenced. Jalisa Thompson, Brandon Thompson pled guilty to money laundering and were sentenced to time served and 15 months’ imprisonment, respectively.

"This case involves a transnational criminal organization (called the “Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network” by U.S. authorities in the criminal indictment) which perpetrated online auction fraud (i.e., advertising and selling non-existent items) against U.S. victims on eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, and AutoTrader.com. The organization primarily operated in Alexandria, Romania, with some operations taking place in other areas of Eastern Europe, as well as the United States. The victims of the online auction fraud paid for the fake items with “reloadable prepaid cards, prepaid debit cards, and gift cards of varying types (collectively referred to herein as ‘prepaid debit cards’), including Green Dot Moneypaks, Visa One Vanilla prepaid debit cards, PayPal My Cash cards, and Amazon gift cards; United States postal money orders; cashier’s checks; MoneyGram and Western Union wires; and bank wires and deposits.”The Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network worked with others to launder criminal proceeds, by taking the money paid by victims for the fake items sold online, converting the money to Bitcoin, transferring the Bitcoin to members and associates in Eastern Europe, and using Bitcoin exchanges to convert the Bitcoin to fiat currency. Associates of the organizations in the United States, such as J.A.V., obtained victim payments, converted them to Bitcoins, and sent the Bitcoins to members of the organization who had perpetrated the online auction fraud. Third-party money launderers in the U.S. (i.e., A.E.N., D.A.B., and R.W.D.L.T) were also used to collect, redeem, and convert victim payment into cash or Bitcoins.

"This case involves an international online child sexual exploitation ring, the Bored group, which met, organized its activities, and operated exclusively online. The Bored group earned this nickname because the chatrooms they created all included the word “bored” in them. Initially, the group met on Stickham, a social media platform which was popular for live streaming video chats. Frustrated with the moderation that existed on this site, they migrated to other sites and ultimately ended up using one unidentified site that was not moderated. The chatrooms they created on this site could not be found unless the person knew the URL of the chatroom.The perpetrators devised and executed a plan to lure targets from moderated platforms to an unmoderated chatroom-based forum and entice them to engage in sex acts. Specifically, the members of the group worked together to recruit, entice, and coerce minors to engage in sex acts during video-chat sessions. To accomplish this, members of the group created fake profiles of teenage boys on social media and dating sites, such as MYLOL.com, Periscope, YouNow, and Gifyo, to target minor girls. The members would then identify minors to target, contact, and communicate with in order to get the victims to join the offenders in unmonitored chatrooms. All of the members of the group spent a considerable amount of time communicating with their targets in order to gain their trust, build rapport with them, and ultimately, entice the victims to commit sex acts. Beyond communication, Bored group members used several techniques to manipulate victims, including:1. Dares. Daring minors to engage in sexualized behaviour and sex acts.2. Polls. Running polls with participants in the chat rooms about the attractiveness of minors and/or voting on what type of items of clothing the minor should remove and/or what type of sex act the minor should engage in.3. Competitions. Minors were pitted against each other in an effort to be rewarded (i.e., they would receive points for engaging in certain sexualized behaviour and sex acts, and advance levels based on points).4. Purporting to Block Cameras. To reduce the inhibitions of minors, members who victims trusted (called “handlers”) would claim that they could block the camera and prevent others in the chatroom from viewing the victims. When the handler told other group members that this tactic was used, the participants in the chatroom would pretend that they were unable to see the victim’s web camera.  5. Loops. Pre-recorded videos of minors talking and/or engaging in sexualized behaviour or sex acts.  These videos were played as if they were occurring in real-time in order to manipulate a minor into engaging in similar conduct and/or acts. The Bored group had distinct roles for members: hunters, talkers, and loopers. Hunters lured victims to the chatroom. Talkers handled the next phase, which involved convincing the minors to undress and masturbate on camera by engaging them in conversation and building trust and rapport. Loopers posed as a female minor and played a pre-recorded video of a previous victim talking or engaging in sex acts (but passed it off as if it was playing in real-time). Loopers played these pre-recorded videos in an effort to convince girls to perform a sex act.As a method to monitor, evaluate, and coordinate their activities, track progress, and share their knowledge and expertise, they would discuss their plans, activities, and experiences on a separate site (the now defunct Titan Pad) and record their activities and experiences on a password-protected spreadsheet on that site that included information about which chatrooms on the website were associated with which victims and the social media accounts associated with members that were used to lure each of the victims. The spreadsheet also enabled the members of the group to keep track of the manipulation techniques that were successful with each victim and what sex acts each victim engaged in (including extremely depraved acts; e.g., one member of the group enticed a minor to engage in a sex act with a dog). After Titan Pad ceased its operation in 2017, the Bored group moved its activities to Discord, a group chat platform, with voice and video capabilities.The defendant, Caleb Young, pled guilty to child exploitation enterprise and received 30 years’ imprisonment for his crime. Other members of the group were also charged and sentenced for their crimes. C.M., the leader of the child exploitation enterprise, received 40 years’ imprisonment for his crime. He was killed in prison during an altercation with other inmates in January 2019. Other members of the group received 38 years’ (A.S.), 37 years and 6 months’ (O.O.), 35 years’ (J.N.R.), 31 years and 3 months’ (M.F.), and 30 years and 6 months’ imprisonment (B.J.S. and D.W., each) for their crimes. All of the members of the group were ordered to pay each identified victim restitution (i.e., USD 5,000 to each victim).",drug offences,Sentenced
"This case involves the co-founders, administrators and members of the Infraud Organization, which was founded in 2010 and was active between 2010 and 2018. The slogan of the organization was “in fraud we trust.” The Infraud Organization operated as a criminal enterprise with its objective of financially enriching its members through cybercrimes, particularly online fraud and identity theft. The illicit acts the organization engaged in included money laundering, identity theft, counterfeit identification trafficking, bank fraud, wire fraud, among other crimes. In total, the organization caused USD 568 million in actual losses and USD 2.2 billion in intended losses. The Infraud Organization ran an online discussion forum, known as Infraud, which had over 10,000 members from around the world. According to the Second Superseding Criminal Indictment, the roles of individuals that were part of this criminal enterprise included administrators, super moderators, moderators, vendors, VIP members, and members:1. Administrators.  Administrators were responsible for “long-term strategic planning” of the enterprise, and daily management tasks, such as determining responsibilities and levels of access of all members, vetting prospective members, deciding which members can join, and rewarding and punishing existing members.2. Super Moderators. Super moderators were responsible for moderating content by reviewing contraband for sale, editing and deleting posts based on reviews, and mediating disputes between buyers and vendors (i.e., sellers). The content they moderated was assigned based on either geographic area or criminal expertise.3. Moderators. Moderators have some of the same responsibilities for moderating content, but they have less privileges and authority than super moderators. 4. Vendors. Individuals who sold and/or advertised illicit goods and services on the site.5. VIP members. VIP members were longstanding, distinguished members of the platform.6. Members.  General members of the forum.The founders of the organization are Svyatoslav Bondarenko and Sergey Medvedev. Along with being a co-founder, Sergey Medvedev served as the administrator of the site and ran the escrow service of the organization, which held funds for a purchase in escrow until the buyer received the items purchased (in good order). He further created a virtual currency exchange service where virtual currencies were exchanged for fiat currencies, promoted, created incentives, and set prices for advertisements on Infraud. The defendant assumed leadership of the organization after Svyatoslav Bondarenko disappeared.For quality control of contraband recovered from acts of fraud and identity theft, members provided feedback and ratings of vendors and their products. To protect individuals who are part of this criminal enterprise, measures were taken to secure the site and restrict access to the site. Svyatoslav Bondarenko established rules governing the conduct of members on Infraud and these rules were enforced by administrators, moderators, and supermoderators of the forum. Members who violated these rules were punished by, for example, being removed and banned from the site. All new members had to be vetted before being granted access to the forum.In this case, 36 defendants were charged for their roles in the Infraud Organization. The criminal proceedings for most of these defendants are still ongoing. The defendant, one of the founders of Infraud, Sergey Medvedev, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in a racketeer influenced corrupt organization. The other founder, Svyatoslav Bondarenko, is still at large. Two other defendants and members of Infraud pleaded guilty to engage in a racketeer influenced corrupt organization. Firstly, Jose Gamboa became a member of Infraud in December 2010 and advertised as vendor of custom-built ATM skimmers within the Infraud forum. Secondly, Valerian Chiochiu advised other members on the development and use of malware. He also developed malware that was used by other members to gain unauthorized access to personal and financial data and access device data. The illegally obtained information would then be sold on the Infraud forum to other Infraud members. The defendant also fraudulently purchased gift cards which were then sold on the Infraud forum to members for a profit.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"In or around July 2014, ALEXANDRE CAZES, aka ""ALPHA02,"" aka ""ADMIN,"" with· other persons, known and unknown to the. Grand Jury, created AlphaBay (also referred to as the ""AlphaBay Market""), a dark-web marketplace designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. The site also enabled users to purchase and sell illegal services, including “tumbling” and “mixing” services, which are forms of money laundering used for digital currencies.From its official launch in December 2014 AlphaBay was used by thousands of vendors to distribute controlled substances and other illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars deriving from these illegal transactions. AlphaBay also provided a private, internal messaging service through which staff, vendors, and buyers could communicate, as well as an associated web forum called the ""AlphaBay Market Forum."" On 1 June 2017, an arrest warrant would be issued for Alexandre CAZES that would be satisfied approximately one month later on 5 July 2017. CAZES was arrested during a raid on his home in Bangkok, Thailand and was held by the Royal Thai Police for approximately seven days before apparently committing suicide while in custody on 12 July 2017.

"This case involves several cyber and organized crime related offences of the creator of Silk Road, a massive online marketplace which sold illicit goods and services, in particular drugs. The defendant, Ross William Ulbricht, created Silk Road in January 2011, and owned and operated the website until it was shut down by law enforcement authorities in October 2013.The defendant deliberately operated Silk Road as an online criminal marketplace with the intent to facilitate its users to buy and sell illegal goods and services anonymously and under the radar of law enforcement. The defendant aimed at anonymizing transactions on Silk Road by operating Silk Road on “The Onion Router,” or “Tor” network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed around the world, designed to conceal the true IP addresses, and hence identities of its users; and by including a Bitcoin-based payment system that concealed the identities and locations of the users.The defendant controlled and oversaw every aspect of Silk Road, and managed a staff of paid, online administrators and computer programmers who assisted with the day-to-day operation of the site.  The defendant reaped commissions worth over USD 13 million generated from the illicit sales conducted through the site.The U.S. government learned of Silk Road in 2011, after intercepting a drug package in Chicago's O'Hare airport, and commenced an investigation into the online marketplace. Agents discovered that the Silk Road was run and managed by someone with the screen name of “Dread Pirate Roberts” (D.P.R.). In 2012, law enforcement agents investigated several individuals believed to be “Dread Pirate Roberts,” including Ross Ulbricht, Anand Athavale, and Mark Karpeles. Ultimately, Ulbricht became the primary suspect in 2013 after a series of “pen/trap” orders, which led U.S. law enforcement agents to collect evidence in the form of I.P. address data from Ulbricht’s home wireless network. Additional evidence came from undercover investigations, in which law enforcement agents took over low-level Silk Road administrators’ accounts and interacted with D.P.R. online, in an attempt to expose Ulbricht. In October 2013, at the San Francisco public library, agents arrested Ulbricht after catching him while he was logged in as the administrator of Silk Road and its D.P.R.The defendant was charged with and convicted of distributing narcotics, distributing narcotics by means of the Internet, conspiring to distribute narcotics, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit computer hacking, conspiring to traffic in false identity documents, and conspiring to commit money laundering. He was further accused of soliciting six murders-for-hire in connection with operating the site, although there was no evidence that these murders were actually carried out.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"The defendant, Mr Steven W Chase, founded—and, between 19 August 2014 and 4 March 2015, was the lead administrator of—a website called ‘Playpen’ dedicated to the exchange of child pornography. The site enabled users to chat, exchange, and purchase images of child sexual abuse content in an anonymous way.The site had more than 150,000 users from around the world and was believed by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to be the world’s largest child pornography website. The content of the website was divided into different ‘boards’ categorised according to the age and sex of the victims and the type of sexual activity involved.Following a slip up by Chase in December 2014, Playpen’s unique IP address was exposed to a foreign law enforcement agency. The IP address was revealed to be in the US, and the law enforcement agency notified the FBI.In January 2015 the FBI, in partnership with the US Department of Justice’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, launched ‘Operation Pacifier’, which sought to identify the members of the Playpen website and bring them to justice.On 19 February 2015, the FBI executed a search warrant of Mr Chase’s home and Mr Chase was arrested. Forensic examination of a computer and devices seized during the search found thousands of images of child exploitation material.On 16 September 2016, a federal jury found Mr Chase of multiple charges relating to child pornography and child exploitation. On 1 May 2017 he was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment for these offences.Two other men, Messrs Michael Fluckiger, 46, of Indiana, United States of America, and David Browning, 47, of Kentucky, United States of America, also acted as administrators of the Playpen website.

"This case involves the members of an organized criminal group that operated websites dedicated to the advertisement and distribution of child sexual abuse material. The website had three administrators, including Steven Chase and Michael Fluckiger, and a number of moderators, including David Lynn Browning. The website, which was hosted by a server in North Carolina, could be accessed by members only and operated on the Tor anonymity network, using elaborate file encryption to prevent the detection by law enforcement authorities. In total, more than 150,000 members authored and accessed tens of thousands of postings related to the sexual abuse of children, sometimes as young as infants or toddlers.Browning and Fluckiger were heavily involved in the day-to-day operations, which encompassed managing membership, developing and enforcing strict rules and deleting content unrelated to child sexual abuse material. Browning joined the website on 13 November 2014. Until 4 March 2015, the Browning spent over 700 hours logged in to the website, authored more than 1,000 postings, and designed the logo of the website. In 2015, a criminal complaint was filed against Browning and Fluckiger, accusing them of conspiracy to advertise child pornography contrary to 18 U.S.C. § 2251(d)(1) and (e). Fluckiger pleaded guilty on 2 December 2015 and Browning on 18 December 2015; both were sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment followed by a lifetime term of supervised release.Steven Chase was convicted of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise and related charges on 16 September 2016.

"On January 5, 2012, a grand jury returned an indictment against many of the claimants in this action, charging them with criminal copyright infringement and money laundering ""with estimated harm to copyright holders well in excess of $500,000,000 and reported income in excess of $175,000,000."" The claimants' alleged copyright infringement scheme, dubbed the ""Mega Conspiracy,"" used public websites to facilitate the illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted movies, software, television programs, and music. The government estimates that the alleged criminal conduct has caused billions of dollars in harm to the copyright holders.Following the indictment, the district court issued restraining orders for assets in New Zealand and Hong Kong where most of the remaining identified proceeds resided. The High Court in Hong Kong responded almost immediately by issuing a restraining order against approximately $60 million in assets, while New Zealand first arrested several of the now-claimants, released them on bail, and then several months later, in April, registered restraining orders on $15 million in assets. New Zealand also scheduled extradition hearings for August 2012, but these hearings have been continued at least eight times at the claimants' request.The New Zealand restraining orders could only remain registered for two years, after which they could be extended for up to one year. Recognizing that the restraints would run out on April 18, 2014, or if extended on April 18, 2015, the United States filed this civil forfeiture action against forty-eight assets restrained pursuant to the criminal indictment in the district court on July 29, 2014. Although restraining orders froze the assets in the lead up to this action, the New Zealand courts have routinely released funds to claimants for living and legal expenses. Some of these have been very substantial, including millions in legal fees for Kim Dotcom, and $170,000 per month for living expenses for the same claimant.Most of the claimants in this case filed their claims together on August 28, and Mona Dotcom filed a spousal claim on September 1, 2014. The claimants also filed a joint waiver of notice. The government subsequently moved to strike all the claimants' claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2466, the federal fugitive disentitlement statute. On February 27, 2015, the district court granted the motion to strike, having allowed claimants to appear and present arguments on the motion but not on the merits of the case. The government then moved for default judgment, which the district court granted on March 25, 2015, issuing forfeiture orders for the assets in New Zealand and Hong Kong.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"This case involves seven members of an organized criminal group that used the Domain Name System (DNS) Changer malware with co-conspirators to engage in a fraudulent advertisement scheme.The group posed as a legitimate Internet advertisement agency and entered into Internet advertising agreements where the defendants were paid to receive money each time a user clicked on a website link or advertisement. The defendants used rogue DNS servers and malware to fraudulently increase traffic, in turn increasing their revenue.  The malware would infect users’ systems, alter users’ DNS server settings to route activity to the rogue DNS servers, prevent anti-virus from receiving software updates, and facilitate click hijacking (i.e., where clicking on a search result redirects the user to the perpetrators’ desired site which the perpetrators receive payment for) and click fraud (i.e., fraudulently replacing advertisements on sites with desired advertisements that perpetrators receive payment for). To prevent detection from law enforcement and conceal the source of the proceeds of crime, one of the defendants was suspected of engaging in money-laundering activities by (attempting to) transport the proceeds out of the US.The defendants were charged in a 27-count-indictment in October 2011. Vladimir Tsastsin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit computer intrusion and was sentenced to 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment with one year of supervision after release and was required to forfeit USD 2.5 million.

"In 2013, and international investigation led US prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to charge 7 individuals with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The defendants ran Liberty Reserve, a digital payment facility, which allegedly laundered more than USD 6 billion in criminal proceeds. Liberty Reserve was shut down by US authorities in May 2013 as a result of the investigation. Liberty Reserve – incorporated in 2006 in Costa Rica – was a centralized digital currency service. It allowed users to deposit physical currency – Euros or US Dollars - by converting it into a digital currency pinned to the value of the physical one. Once deposited the money, users were allowed to transfer it to other users. The only personal information required to register was a name, e-mail address and birthdate. Liberty Reserve charged a small fee for each transaction.According to the investigators, Liberty Reserve was operated do facilitate money-laundering. Its structure and high degree of untraceability provided cybercriminals with a perfectly functioning tool to store and transfer the proceeds of their illegal activities. Before its shut down, the overall number of Liberty Reserve’ users worldwide exceeded on million and over 55 million transactions were conducted through its system. Such transactions included the transfer of proceeds of credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, narcotics trafficking.One of the co-founders of Liberty Reserve, Vladimir Kats, an American citizen, pleaded guilty before the Federal Court of the Southern District of New York on 31 October 2013 to conspiring to commit money laundering, conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, receiving child pornography and marriage fraud.The other co-founder, Arthur Budovsky, a citizen of Costa Rica, was arrested in Spain in May 2013 and extradited to the US in October 2014.The US Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations carried out the investigation.

"On 23 January 2013, the US District Court of the Southern District of New York unsealed three indictments against Nikita Vladimirovich Kuzmin, Deniss Calovskis and Mihai Ionut Paunescu. The defendants were charged with conspiracy in fraud and related activities in connection with computers and access devices for the creation and use of the Gozi virus. The Gozi virus is one of the most harmful computer viruses ever created. It infected at least one million computers worldwide and 40,000 in the US. It caused the theft or loss of tens of millions of dollars. The virus was undetectable by anti-virus software and was able to collect data from infected devices, including personal bank account information, usernames and passwords. The stolen information was then transmitted to servers controlled by the defendants. The defendants used such information to steal funds from victims’ bank accounts. Kuzmin created the Gozi virus in 2005. Calovskis developed a number of features, including an altered webpage of a bank that was used to steal personal information from the victims. Paunescu created a “bulletproof host”, i.e. a system preventing law enforcement authorities from detecting illegal activities. He leased servers from legitimate hosting providers and then sub-leased them to the cybercriminals. He also distributed malware, such as the “Zeus trojan” and the “SpyEye trojan”, and spam.Kuzmin was arrested in the US in November 2010 and pled guilty in May 2011. Calovskis was arrested in Latvia in November 2012. In August 2013, the Latvian government agreed to extradite Calovskis to the US. However, Calovskis appealed the decision to the Europen Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR ruled that the extradition is lawful. However, the ECHR ordered the Latvian government not to extradite Calovskis until its judgment became final.Calovskis was later extradited to the US, where he plead guilty to writing part of the virus, and was sentenced to 21 months of prison.

"The case involves illegal bulking email obscene advertising in the US. The defendants started their business in 2003. At the beginning, they operated through a US corporation. Later on, they decided to run their operations from a Mauritian company – using servers located in the Netherlands – in order to avoid compliance with the email communications bill passed in the US in 2003, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (hereinafter, the “CAN-SPAM Act”). The defendants sent email advertisements, including pornographic content. If the recipients clicked on the links contained in the email and subsequently paid a fee, the defendants earned a commission.The defendants used fictitious information in their bulk emails and registration of their domain names. They placed non-existing email addresses in the “From” field in the headers of their emails. They provided false information in the “Contact person” and “Phone number” fields of their domains’ registration.On 25 June 2007, the defendants were convicted on 8 counts from the District Court of Arizona for conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1037(a)(3) through fraud in connection with electronic mail (Count 1), violation of § 1037(a)(3) and (a)(4) through such fraud (Counts 2 and 3), interstate transportation of obscene materials in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1462 (Counts 4 and 5), interstate transportation of obscene materials for sale in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1465 (Counts 6 and 7); conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956 (Count 8), and failure to meet record keeping requirements in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2257 (Count 9).The first three counts regard the offence of “Fraud and related activity in connection with electronic mail” introduced by the CAN-SPAM Act. The defendants were convicted of materially falsifying  header information in multiple commercial electronic mail messages and intentionally initiating the transmission of such messages [§ 1037(a)(3)] and registering, using information that materially falsifies the identity of the actual registrant, for five or more electronic mail accounts or online user accounts or two or more domain names, and intentionally initiating the transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail messages from any combination of such accounts or domain names [§ 1037(a)(4)].The defendants appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals arguing that (i) the district court erred in instructing the jury as to the definition of obscene expression pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1462 and 1465; (ii) the offence of “Fraud and related activity in connection with electronic mail” (18 U.S.C. § 1037) was unconstitutional as it was overly vague; (iii) counts 1-3 were incorrectly labelled as felonies; (iv) the count of conspiracy money laundering is invalid if the preceding appeals are successful since an unlawful activity is a pre-requisite for the money laundering offence; (v) the application of a two-level obstruction of justice enhancement to one of the defendants’ sentence was error.The defendants’ claim that 18 U.S.C. § 1037 was unconstitutional is based on the vagueness doctrine, according to which  “Vague statutes are invalidated for three reasons”: (1) to avoid punishing people for behaviour that they could not have known was illegal; (2) to avoid subjective enforcement of laws based on `arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement' by government officers; and (3) to avoid any chilling effect on the exercise of First Amendment freedoms."" The defendants argued that the terms ""impair,"" ""altered,"" and ""concealed."" used to describe the material falsification were vague. The court rejected the argument.  The court affirmed the defendants’ convictions and sentences and recognized that there was a clerical error with regard to counts 1-3 (the CAN-SPAM Act offences) and remanded.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence

"SummaryHarmony Gold Mine (Pty) Limited is a mining company operating the Masimong Gold Mine in the district of Henneman in South Africa. Miners can legally enter the shafts if they are able to produce a mining identity card used to clock-in and out when entering and exiting the mine. Notwithstanding, it was common knowledge that the clocking system could be breached allowing illegal miners to enter the mine. Illegal mining operations inside the mine were a known phenomenon and illegal processing or refinery plants were found and subsequently destroyed in the past.From 10-11 April 2014, an underground “clean-up” operation to expose illegal miners was carried out by a security agency. During the operation, makeshift gold processing plants, beds, letters, books, name lists and other documents were discovered, together with large quantities of extracted ore. The documents included gold transaction notes and photographs, pointing towards the identities of the illegal miners.The investigation brought to light that ore worth ZAR 125 million were extracted using processing plants. Yet, on site, investigators only discovered material worth ZAR 41 million (1211 tons of ore) that were moved and made ready for further transports using canvas bags.Though no one was arrested during the two-day operations, 22 people were found and arrested between 16 April and 14 July 2014, mostly while being on the mine’s premises. One person was arrested outside the premises, incriminated by document evidence encountered on site.The group of arrested consisted of nationals from Mozambique and Zimbabwe between 20 and 43 years old and were found to have a varying degree of involvement in the illegal enterprise. Lovemore Chaba Mlambo was identified as orchestrating the illegal operations.They were found guilty of racketeering, money laundering, as well as contravention of the Precious Metals Act and the Criminal Procedure Act. On 14 March 2017, the Virginia Circuit Court sentenced them to prison sentences ranging from 3 to 20 years.They appealed the judgment in front of the High Court of South Africa, Free State Division (Bloemfontein) but saw their appeal rejected on 22 March 2019.Details on the appealThe appellants argued that they had not been caught conducting any illegal mining operations. The respondent countered that the essential ingredient for the criminal racketeering activity is the conspiracy to commit an organized criminal offence or to participate in an unlawful enterprise. Hence, the appellants could be prosecuted on racketeering charges even though they were not caught red-handed. The court found that an implicit agreement among the appellants was manifested in the construction of the illegal refinery plants and the fact that ore had been extracted already, which in itself is a laborious effort requiring collaboration. Furthermore, the names of some illegal miners were found in documentation seized on site. Following a similar line of argumentation, the court rejected the challenge of an established common purpose and enterprise-like organization of the appellants.Moreover, the appellants argued that while ore valued up to ZAR 125 million were extracted, only ZAR 41 million (1211 tons) worth of ore were found on site, implying that the lion share of gold could still be somewhere in the mine. Therefore, the mine operator would not have lost that ore. The court denied this argument of appeal based on the fact that the ore encountered had already been extracted and prepared for future transport which, in turn, showed that the group was capable of removing extracted ore from the mining premises. Furthermore, the court argued that the extracted but not encountered ore would amount to a quantity of 2481 tons, making it significant enough to not be overlooked and hence, unlikely to still reside within the premises of the mine. Paperwork seized on the illegal mining site further documented that extracted ore had previously been sold to an outside buyer.Also, the appellants argued that the identity of the perpetrators was not reasonably established beyond doubt.  This is because none of the appellants was found either near the shaft nor mining nor being in possession of gold ore. The respondent argued that the appellants were arrested by staff of the mine security at the surface as they stepped out of the elevator leading down to the mine. None of them was able to identify themselves with a valid mine identity card, yet many of them were in possession of mining equipment such as safety heads, protectors and cap lamps. Hence, the court found it unlikely that any of the arrested coming out of the shaft had any other business in mind than participating in the ongoing illegal mining operation.Consequently, the appeal was rejected.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"SummaryThe three defendants were found guilty on multiple counts relating to running an illegal enterprise which illegally harvested and exported abalones. In March 2019, they were sentenced to 15-18 years imprisonment.Illegal harvesting and trading of abalone have been a reason for concern in South Africa’s Eastern Cape since the 1990s. The seaside city Port Elizabeth is considered a hub for the illegal trade in abalone and has been declared to be a hotspot of criminal enterprises and kingpins. The numbers of abalone, which is mostly sold as delicacy to Asia, has been in decline, sparking the government to respond to the issue by establishing dedicated teams seeding abalone and patrolling the area.Details On 22 March 2015, a member of the South African Police Service observed suspicious activities while being on patrol along the coast heading towards Noordhoek. He observed individuals coming out of the water loading backs onto vehicles. He chased the vehicles and was able to arrest one suspect after a hot pursuit, encountering abalone on the suspect’s car. Another suspect working for the defendants was found in possession of abalone without a permit a month later. The South African Police Service launched an investigation into the operation of the defendants.The lead investigator described the illegal operations of the defendants as syndicate-like. While their enterprise relied on the support of several people, the defendants conducted their operations on a need-to-know basis, in which different participants in the supply chain would have limited knowledge about the overall operation. Abalones are being harvested by divers using diving equipment provided for by the accused. The harvested abalones would be packed and marked with an identification mark of the respective harvester. From there, the abalones would be loaded onto motor vehicles, from where a driver would take them to the “weight house”. In that station, the abalones would be sorted by size, had their shell removed and weighted. Based on their weight, the divers would be paid. Another driver would then take the abalones to another location where they would be stored in freezers. Yet another person would later pick them up to transport them to the processing plant, where the abalones get cleaned and cooked. Via the cities of Gauteng or Cape Town, the abalones would ultimately be shipped to China and sold as delicacy.",trafficking in firearms,Sentenced
"Johannes Erasmus van Staden was a Cape Town businessman and registered representative vendor of Indo Atlantic Seafoods (Pty) Limited, Indo Atlantic Shipping limited and Southern Ocean Marine Corporation (Pty) Limited. From 2005 to 2008, he engaged in an illegal scheme through which he defrauded the South African Revenue Service (SARS). His modus operandi included falsely presenting invoices and inflated fish export records to the SARS, which in return refunded VAT to Mr. van Staden’s company. Over the course of time, Mr. van Staden defrauded taxes of more than R250 million. In June 2016, he was found guilt on 43 charges of racketeering, fraud, reckless conduct of business, and contravention of the Prevention of Organized Crime Act, such as money laundering. Mr. Staden was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and had R6 million worth of assets confiscated.During 2005 and 2008, Mr. van Staden submitted false records about alleged fish exports to the SARS, indicating much higher amounts of fish exports than accurate. Furthermore, he submitted alleged expenditures of his business, such as expenditures for refrigerator systems, delivery trucks, and fish production lines. He obtained authentic invoices for these expenditures by requesting quotes from different providers in the fisheries industry. He repeatedly accepted offers and asked for invoices, which he claimed were for financial purposes. Upon reception of these invoices, he submitted them to the SARS but walked away from the deals. Through this, Mr. van Staden not only defrauded money from the SARS but also inflicted significant economic damage on third-party service providers.In early 2005, Mr. van Staden approached S&D Consulting to function as bookkeeper and accountant to the Indo Atlantic group on a commission basis. Later that year, the First National Bank closed the account of Indo Atlantic Seafoods (Pty) Limited, upon which S&D Consulting started to receive their financial transactions instead. After deducting their commission and fee, SD Consulting forwarded the money to Indo Atlantic companies. Mr. van Staden lived a lavish lifestyle with that money, funnelling it through a family trust called Swordfish Trust. Through this, he financed his luxury expenses, including the purchase of a game farm, an airplane, different motor vehicles, an apartment for his daughter, and a family vacation with chartered jet.The initial indictment was directed at Mr. van Staden and five other potential perpetrators. In June 2016, Mr. van Staden was found guilty on 43 out of 184 counts, whereas the other accused were found not guilty on all charges. Mr. Staden was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and had R6 million worth of assets confiscated.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"Juan Hattingh was a young practicing attorney and conveyancer with a portfolio of high profile clients that included four important South African banks, namely, ABSA, Standard Bank, First National Bank, and Nedbank. Apart from his firm, Hattingh Attorneys, of which he was the sole proprietor, he also held interests in other local firms of attorneys. As his practice flourished, he ventured into other enterprises such as property development and construction. In 2011, he pleaded guilty to a sophisticated scheme of fraud, theft, and money laundering in which he utilized his professional attorney’s trust account for criminal purposes. The scheme included the registration of properties acquired by Hattingh under the names of friends and relatives, double-bonded properties, and the use of his trust account as a deposit for the stolen funds. “In other words, he had operated his trust account as a vehicle through which to launder the proceeds of his unlawful activities.” (Hamman & Koen, 2012). Hattingh was convicted of 64 counts of fraud, one count of theft and one count of money laundering. He received an effective term of 20 years' imprisonment for the charges of fraud and theft, and a suspended sentence of 8 years' imprisonment for the charge of money laundering. Additionally, the Law Society successfully applied to have his name struck off the roll of practicing attorneys.On appeal against the sentences imposed on him in respect of the fraud charges, he contended that the trial court had sentenced him beyond the scope of his guilty plea and had overlooked mitigating factors. The Supreme Court of Appeal agreed with him and reduced his sentence to 12 years' imprisonment for the charge of fraud.",drug offences,Sentenced
"In November 2010, under the authority of the South African National Director of Public Prosecution, Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited entered into an agreement whereby it pleaded guilty to 102 counts related to charges stemming from having allowed its ‘employees and facilities to be used to conduct … illegal kidney transplant operations’. In addition to Netcare, a number of other charges were laid against the St Augustine's Hospital, located in Durban, South Africa, the CEO of Netcare, Richard Friedland, and eight others: four transplant doctors, a nephrologist, two transplant administrative coordinators, and an interpreter. The admission of guilt related to 109 illegal kidney transplant operations that took place between June 2001 and November 2003. The scheme involved Israeli citizens in need of kidney transplants who would be brought to South Africa for transplants performed at St Augustine's Hospital.While the kidneys supplied originally came from Israeli citizens, ‘later Romanian and Brazilian citizens were recruited as their kidneys were obtainable at a much lower cost’. The broker, Ilan Perry, was the individual who was in charge of the recruitment of both kidney suppliers and recipients and was not South African and has not been charged. He set a fee of between USD 100,000 and USD 120,000 for recipients and paid the original suppliers of kidneys USD 20,000. However, later on in the scheme, Romanians and Brazilians received on average of USD 6,000.Ilan Perry used recruiters to source individuals ready to supply kidneys; two of these, Captain Ivan Da Silva and Gaby Tauber, had been imprisoned in Brazil for their roles in the affair. Blood screening of prospective kidney suppliers was done in-country and again in South Africa in an attempt to ‘ensure sufficient compatibility with prospective recipients’; those deemed suitable were ‘accommodated and chaperoned’ and ‘given documents to sign falsely indicating that they were related to each other’. This fraudulent activity was meant to circumvent the requirement to gain outside approval, via a Ministerial Committee, for transplants of unrelated principals. While Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited was paid up-front for its participation in the illegal kidney transplants, the people supplying the healthy kidneys were paid after the fact and in cash.The charges to which Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited pleaded guilty were laid under the South African Human Tissue Act 1983 and the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 1998. It might be mentioned that the company escaped charges which had been leveled at the other accused, including fraud, forgery, and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm (for operations without informed consent). The Human Tissue Act 1983 prohibited the transplantation of the tissue of minors into another living person; requiring that written consent be provided; and that no purchase of tissue, such as kidneys, was allowed. Further, there existed a Ministerial Policy of the Department of Health which set out, inter alia, that:“Donor organs must be used primarily for South African citizens and permanent residents. Written consent must be obtained from the Minister of Health before any person who is not a South African citizen or permanent resident is accepted onto a transplantation programme.”The Ministerial policy also established that a Ministerial Committee had to approve applications for transplantation of unrelated living donors so as ‘to reduce the possibility of abuse’.The prosecutor later argued that the company and the other accused must have been aware of the law and policy regarding transplants from living donors, and that they had to try to find a way to portray ostensible compliance with the current policy and legislation. They therefore created the pretence that the kidney suppliers were related to the recipients.The first charge--counts 1 to 5--to which Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited pleaded guilty related to the use of five minors as organ suppliers in violation of the Human Tissue Act 1983. The employees of St Augustine's Hospital were recognised, in the convoluted Charge Sheet of the Prosecutor, to be ‘acting on behalf of the accused company and were about the exercised of their powers and the performance of their duties as employees of the company furthering or endeavouring to further the interests of the company’, in carrying out these illegal kidney transplants. Counts 6 to 10 constituted the second charge and related to receiving payment for the kidney transplants emanating from the five minors. It might be mentioned that Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited received payments from the broker and it then disbursed payment ‘to the other accused and service providers; including the surgeons for their services’. The third charge, consisting of counts 11 through 102, related to contravention of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 1998. In regard to the 102 transplant operations that did not include minors, the company pleaded guilty to its employees having received money, the proceeds of an unlawful activity; while Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited admitted that ‘in the circumstances’, it knew ‘that the aforementioned property formed part of the proceeds of unlawful activities’.In the Agreement between Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited and the State, the State recognised its own legitimate interest ‘in overseeing the control over transplant of human tissues […] the interests of the medical profession and the public at large’. Where the public interest was concerned, the Agreement noted:“that a company, such as the accused company, guilty of an offence such as this, should be convicted and punished and more particularly, that that conviction and punishment should take place in open court for society as a whole to come to know and understand that the prosecuting authorities and the Department of Health will not tolerate breaches of the code of conduct and standards of ethics and compliance with the law required in a civilised society.”The Agreement then set out the penalty imposed: a confiscation order of ZAR 3,800,000 (approximately USD 466,839) amounting to the benefit the company derived from the offences, plus a sentence of ZAR 4,020,000 (approximately USD 493,875) amounting to fines for each of the counts to which Netcare Kwa-Zulu (Pty) Limited pleaded guilty.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"The organized criminal group is highly organised and operates transnationally. They are commonly known in South Africa as the “Mountain Boys”.The syndicate engaged in a range of criminal activities that constitute serious offences under South African law. The offences relate to racketeering activities and related categories of offences including money-laundering offences. The information gathered further indicates that in addition thereto these entities and persons have through their criminal activities committed a range of further serious offences including theft, fraud as well as offences under the provisions of the South African Mining Rights Act as well as the Precious Metals Act. There are five clearly distinguishable levels of activities used by the syndicate to smuggle unwrought precious metals (PGMs). This is illustrated as follows:As a starting point, PGMs are stolen at source from the mines, often in large quantities. These PGMs are eventually sold through various receivers to exporters.The various levels of the criminal operators in the illicit PGM industry can be explained as follows:Level 1 “the runners”The unwrought PGM’s are stolen from the processing plants in South African Mines and is commonly referred to as “theft at the source”. A runner, who is mostly an employee of the mine, will then transport the material from the mine by bag or by other methods and sell it to a middleman. Runners tend to have a wide network of black market contacts, including illicit smelters.Level 2 “the middleman”The middleman buys considerable volumes of PGMs from the runners. The middleman crushes the PGMs into smaller pieces and packages it for the national buyers, before delivery.Level 3 “national buyers”The national buyers are mostly based in the RSA and they buy the PGM’S from the level 1 and 2’s. These buyers appear to be the link between the runners and more sophisticated syndicates who constitute the next level in the hierarchy of the criminal operators. These buyers are often the agents of the more sophisticated syndicate or they operate as independent couriers for such syndicates. Their task is to buy and transport the material from the middleman to wealthy local syndicate leaders.Level 4 “the local syndicate leader”The syndicate leader / buyer use a fronting company, usually a Scrap Metal dealer to export the product from the RSA. The PGM stocks that they have purchased from various sources are processed, containerised or packaged and then sold to local or international contacts. Processing allows for detailed records to be kept by the syndicate leaders from whom the product is bought and samples are also takenfor analysis (assay) to determine value and PGM content. Storage bags/drums are weighed, marked and sealed. Smaller high value PGM parcels are exported using a courier network and bulk tonnage of PGM is containerised and either flown or shipped from the RSA. Misrepresentations are made to customs by undervaluing and falsifying the nature of the consignment. This then successfully overcomes the requirements for prescribed permits and licences to possess transport and deal in the product as required by the Act.Level 5 “the international buyers”The international contacts are situated abroad. The international market for unwrought PGM’s appears to be more attractive than the South African market as it is unregulated. Sophisticated networks, consisting of legal persons and entities register to deal in PGMs have been established abroad to deal with the imports and proceeds derived from the sale after being sold to the refiners in Western Europe, United Kingdom and Canada, capable of refining the product for commercial use. It appears that the ultimate destination is inevitably a buyer abroad rather than someone in South Africa.Note: The current syndicate under discussion were classified as level 3 to 5 operators.Legal entities involved in the case:1. Group members and others employed by or associated with the group, procured unwrought precious metals (PGMs), comprising platinum in the main from mines in South Africa, especially the Rustenburg area, where after samples thereof would be assayed by legal entities and/or persons to determine content and value, where after it would be exported to Just Refiners and Technology, UK or to a company styled as an international freight forwarding company, based in Felixstowe, Suffolk, United Kingdom, Canada and elsewhere.2. Before being dispatched by front companies especially used as part of the concealment of the illicit PGMs, the PGMs would be stored and packed into containers for export purposes in various warehouses in and around Johannesburg. If of large quantity it would then be shipped from Durban and if of smaller quantity from Johannesburg airport.3. Before being shipped, documentation for export purposes containing false information regarding content, value and/or exporter would be prepared and presented to the authorities.4. With reference to certain of the charges, Boekhoud would cause the unwrought precious metals to be assayed upon receipt in the United Kingdom at a company based in Sheffield, United Kingdom, and then upon receipt of the correct values of the product prepare or cause to be prepared so – called self – billing invoices and inform the exporters of the true value and content. Boekhoud, would then, having been provided with banking details by V Naidoo or Hoosan, remit the proceeds of sales to accounts as directed.When acting as they did the accused acted with a common purpose to commit the offences charged with.5. The Accused and others were a group of individuals associated in fact with one another for purposes of obtaining monetary benefits by means of engaging in illegal procurement and smuggling of unwrought precious metals, and, as such, their association in fact constituted an enterprise as defined in section 1(1) (v) of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, 121 of 1998.6. V Naidoo was the leader of the group. He was actively involved in the procurement and dispatch phases of unwrought precious metals and directing where proceeds from sales were to be remitted to.7. Boekhoud was a director and shareholder of a company styled Just Refiners & Technology Ltd, based in Ramsey, Huntingdon in the United Kingdom (“JRT, UK”). JRT, UK received, refined and disposed of the unwrought precious metals at a profit on behalf of the group. Boekhoud was a member of or associated with the group until the end of 2001.8. R Naidoo, a younger brother of V Naidoo, assisted in the procurement of unwrought precious metals and in storing such before being exported to the United Kingdom, Canada or elsewhere.9. R Moonian assisted in the procurement and storing of unwrought precious metals before disposal.10. Longhow collected and caused to be sampled unwrought precious metals on behalf of the enterprise during the period 2000 to 2001, where after he left the group with Kevin Naidoo (the younger brother of V Naidoo and R Naidoo) and formed a new group involved in the same activities.11. Y Chetty collected and caused to be sampled unwrought precious metals on behalf of the group.12. Hoosan procured unwrought precious metals on behalf of the group. He also, on occasion, directly or indirectly, informed accused 1 as to where the proceeds of sales of unwrought precious metals were to be remitted into international bank accounts and also assisted the syndicate to trade with the proceeds of crime in exchange for South African currency (using a havala type informal banking scheme)13. James procured PGMs and was the accountant for his brother in law, Boekhoud and JRT.14. There were also other individuals employed by or associated with the group from time to time, who assisted in the procurement, transportation or disposal of unwrought precious metals.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"OverviewIn June 2016, inside the Makana Resort in Grahamstown South Africa, three men were arrested by the South African Police Service (SAPS) as part of a wider police operation called Full Moon. The three accused were caught red-handed, carrying a freshly removed 10.7kg rhino horn, a tranquilizer dart gun including darts and tranquilizers, a bow saw, ammunition, knives, side cutters, a cordless drill, and several phones and sim cards.The investigation of the case could link the accused to 13 separate incidents of alleged rhino poaching which took place between 2013 and 2016. In April 2019, all three accused were found guilty on 50 counts and sentenced to 25 years in prison each.DetailsIn June 2016 the white rhino Cambell was killed and his horn was taken at a farm in the district of Albany, South Africa. A post-mortem examination into the death of Cambell was initiated. The bull was lying in a large pool of blood with blood tainted foam located on its right side with the front horn missing. The sinuses and airways were exposed when the horn was removed, which was done using a sharp serrated blade. From the injuries it became apparent that the rhino was still alive during the procedure. Furthermore, the examination concluded that in the absence of a bullet entry into the rhino’s body, it had been immobilized by the use of a highly potent drug. The death of the animal was caused by the damage to tissues and blood vessels, the resulting blood loss along with the amount of pain.As part of the operation Full Moon, an operation named after the fact that many rhino killings take place during periods of full moon, the South African Police Service (SAPS) arrested three men in the night of 17 June 2016. The three accused Jabulani John Ndlovu (accused 1), Forget Ndlovu (accused 2) and Sibusiso Sani Ndlovu (accused 3) were arrested in Grahamstown, South Africa. At the time of their arrest, several items used for rhino poaching operations were found in their chalet, including a freshly removed rhino horn and a saw (see full list below).Further investigations found that the freshly harvested horn belonged to the white rhino Cambell. DNA material of the horn was also found on the saw seized during the arrest. During the course of the investigation, the poaching of Cambell was linked to nine other rhino killings which took place between 2013 and 2016 in several districts in South Africa. The post-mortem examinations of all crime scenes concluded the same modus operandi had been used for the killing and harvesting of the rhinos and their horns. In particular, the modus operandi encompassed: the incidents took place during the period of the full moon; tracks of two persons were found at each crime scene; dart guns and a specific dart (Pnew dart) were used; all rhinos were tranquilized using Etorphine and/or Thiafentanil; and the horns were removed in a specific manner with a saw. In some instances, the rhinos were heavily pregnant, in which cases the sub-adults’ horns had been removed in the same way as their mothers’. Moreover, cell phone data of the accused phones showed that the phones were used in timely and spatial proximity to the previous poaching incidents.The accused were charged with ten separate incidents of alleged rhino poaching, including 50 counts related to these. In March 2019, the accused were found guilty on ten counts of theft; ten counts of carrying out a restricted activity involving a specimen of a protected species without a permit; ten counts of illegal hunting; ten counts of the possession of a scheduled substance; ten counts of unlawful possession of ammunition. Furthermore, 15 other counts on three separate poaching incidents that were initially on the charge sheet were separated and bound for another trial.One month later, on 3 April 2019, the High Court of South Africa sentenced each of the accused to 25 years imprisonment.",drug offences,Not Sentence
"According to her statements, V1 was probably 26 years old when her exposure to drugs began. In her childhood, she was molested by someone close to her family. This had a great impact on her life as an adult person. She felt unloved and dirty. To cope she took her mother’s prescription medicine, anti-depressants and sleeping tablets. Her first marriage was abusive, and she divorced her husband whilst expecting her first child. By this time, she was a full corporal working as a chef at the air force base. She turned to alcohol and stated that she was becoming an alcoholic. Her friendship with a certain sergeant, a male work colleague lead to her introduction to the sordid world of hard drugs. The sergeant took her to a Nigerian dealer in Sunnyside, Pretoria. He taught her how the drug, which she came to know as ‘rocks’ was smoked using a glass pipe. She enjoyed the experience of drug-induced happiness and over time, her cravings grew. From once a month to once a week, they made more frequent trips to Sunnyside to obtain drugs. Eventually she found herself smoking drugs every other day. Her salary of R4700.00 could not fund her addiction and she borrowed money and began selling her household goods. The sergeant suggested that if she agreed to have sex with the dealer they would get a free supply of drugs. This exchange of sex for drugs extended to other Nigerian dealers as well. Eventually she began going out on her own to obtain drugs.It was during one such outing that she was taken in by a certain Nigerian dealer when she found herself stranded at night as her motor bike needed repairs. Under the guise of offering to help her, she was taken to his flat and given more drugs. From then onwards she never returned home permanently. Because she was absent without leave, she lost her job. She went on to recount a detailed train of events, which eventually resulted in her being taken in by the accused. The details are omitted only to the extent that bear light on her transformation from drug addict to becoming a fully-fledged sex slave. The person who assisted her with her motor bike had other girls living in his flat. She was given clothes and taught how to work the streets as a prostitute. Her every movement was monitored and all income she made was taken from her. Depending on how much money she made she received rocks in exchange.She was sold to another Nigerian dealer known as Omeka who took her off the streets and advertised her body on the internet. She was photographed, and advertisements were placed offering her sexual services. She stayed here for several months and made a lot of money for the dealer.  When she managed to return to Sunnyside she met a Nigerian who she referred to as ‘Uncle’. He supplied her with rocks in exchange for her working for him as a prostitute. She thereafter was passed on and worked for another Nigerian called John during which time she realised she was pregnant. She was not allowed to leave the house and did not have many clients. Because she was not making any money John sold her to the accused.She occupied the accused’s 2-bedroom flat with a Coloured woman and a Nigerian man. She shared one room with the accused and the other couple the other. She had sexual intercourse with the accused to obtain drugs. The pattern of her lifestyle was the same – her body was advertised in provocative poses on the internet after being photographed in skimpy underwear. Men would make appointments for sex after viewing the site. Advertisements were placed on sites such as Sex Trader, Escort South Africa and Red Velvet. She had no choice in the matter. The men would call at the flat where the sexual encounters took place. Her other chores included cleaning the flat and making food. Initially she remained locked in with the Nigerian keeping guard over them. The accused collected her earnings in the evenings when he returned. In exchange, he gave her rocks for half the value of the money earned. She was unable to say whether he had any other source of income. The accused became angry if she did not see clients and bring in money. She saw 4 to 5 clients a day at a rate of R400.00 for half an hour and R500.00 for an hour. Her sole motivation to see clients was to make money for the accused to obtain drugs and sustain her addiction. Her morning drug doze, which she called the ‘wake up’ drug, was provided free by the accused and so was the evening drug, which she referred to as the ‘sleeper’.She believed that the accused was her pimp. All money earned was collected by the accused who gave her drugs in exchange. She stated that the accused used her earnings to pay the rent, buy food, toiletries and clothes for her, as she had to look good for the clients. The accused kept the rest of the money for himself.  There was a time on her birthday that the accused took her to a shopping centre to see her parents for about 15 minutes whilst keeping her under observation all the time. She did not disclose that she was being kept against her will by the accused. They lived in Faerie Glen at that time. Because she was given a cell phone so that clients could contact her, she was able to contact the Welfare regarding the birth of her child. In the accused’s absence, she left to stay at this welfare home for a week where her child was born. She stated that for a while she overcame the cravings to take any drugs, as having the child was more important to her. She decided against putting the child up for adoption and returned to live with her parents. She was even able to find work as a receptionist for a month or two. However, her addiction overcame her and on a trip one evening to buy drugs, the accused traced her and forcefully took her to Silverton. She began living there with the accused and a certain KC, who was also Nigerian. The accused again arranged for her to see clients after she was advertised on the sex website. KC manufactured drugs in the kitchen and sold it to the accused. She estimated that she made approximately R40 000.0 a month and all of this went to the accused. Her movements were severely restricted, and she was effectively locked up in the building. The accused threatened to kill her if she tried to run away again. Thereafter they moved to a flat in Silversands.V1 narrated an incident about an assault when the accused followed her to a flat where she was severely beaten. He hit her using his fists and open hands, kicked her on her ribs, beat her with a dog chain and stick all over her body. She was no longer on speaking terms with her parents who blamed her for leaving her children. In her loneliness, she explained that she turned to making the accused’s life happy so that her life could be happy. There were many instances when he assaulted her and punished her by not giving her drugs. He manipulated her emotionally and made her believe that she was worthless. When they moved to Loskop Street, she was able to escape in the boot of the car of the client of another girl. She returned to her parent’s home and stayed there for a long time. Her third daughter was born during this time. She reverted to using drugs again. The accused came across her one evening when she went to buy drugs and took her back with him. She had earlier incurred a drug debt with a certain Nigerian dealer called JJ who held her motor bike as security for payment. The accused made this payment of R2000.00 on her behalf after she was escorted by force to his car. The arrangements were that she would live with a certain Chooks for a while and that her bike would be collected later.During her stay with Chooks, she reverted to prostitution through the internet and received her daily supply of drugs. Chooks became her new pimp for a while, although she later found out that the money was shared with the accused. The accused got to know that Chooks made a lot of money from the clients which she picked up from a local bar and took her away to live in Elarduspark, which was the home of a certain Cheedi, a person the accused worked for when he arrived in South Africa. They rented a room there. There were other prostitutes in the house. Because the accused failed to pay the rent, they left to live in a flat in Sunnyside. A certain Charles owned this flat and 4 or 5 other prostitutes occupied it. The ladies worked the streets for clients. The accused kept guard over V1, who worked on the internet and the streets.Eventually, they moved to Sandalwood Road, Newlands. She and the accused occupied the bottom level. This was the address where the accused was arrested. This was also the address where the 2nd complainant V2 came to live a few months later. V2 was an 18-year-old drug addict recruited by Chooks for which he also got a share of her earnings as a prostitute. She believed that the accused had sex with V2 the evening she arrived because she came across a condom.  She had no knowledge of any rape. The accused continued to make more money with two girls working. They saw more clients here and made more money all of which the accused controlled. The girls were advertised in newspapers and the internet. All sexual activities took place in exchange for drugs supplied by the accused at this venue rented by the accused. When the clients called at the premises, the accused would lurk in the background so that he was not seen but he always was informed what was going on. The witness was shown a bundle of cell phone records, but she was unable to confirm that any of the names appearing therein were used by her or related to her.She contacted her parents through Facebook and arranged to go to the Children’s Court in Pretoria North to sign off her last born so that her parents would become legal guardians of her child. It was before magistrate Hitchcock that she made a full disclosure which caused the magistrate to report the matter to the Hawks. V1 accompanied the officers to point out the premises where the accused was arrested. She was thereafter in protective custody.Under cross examination she denied that the accused was the father of her second born child. She conceded that the only reason she continued to stay on with the drug dealers was because of her drug addiction and she believed that she was acting out of her own free will at the time. She denied that her working as a prostitute was due to an arrangement she had with the accused. It was put to her that she was not forced to see clients and she only did so get money for her addiction. She denied this. She clarified that her wake up and sleeper drugs were given to her by the accused free of charge. However, if she did not see clients she was not given food, and something was taken away from her as punishment. She further conceded that although opportunities presented itself for her to run away from the accused, the accused made threats to kill her family if she ever tried to run away and he had her motor cycle.There was a time when her father reported her missing to the police. She was questioned about a police raid, which took place whilst living in Elarduspark, which created an opportunity for her to make a report to the police. She affirmed that she did so, but they returned her to the accused. This made her lose all faith and hope in their ability to help her. The accused maintained that after she left, it was she who contacted him to settle her debts, which he did to stop her working on the streets. She denied this and maintained that it created a further obligation to advertise her on the internet and force her to offer her sexual services over a long time.Statements of V2According to her statements, V2 was 6 months old when she, together with her sisters and brother were placed in the welfare social system. This happened after she was raped by her father. Her mother became a prostitute. She was then moved to another home, which separated her from her siblings. From there she was placed in the Morester Children’s Home until she was 12 years old.  She was thereafter transferred to the Catherine Robinson Children’s Home in Vereeniging. Here she was subjected to bullying and mockery which resulted in her getting into fights with other learners. At the Home she associated with a group of girls she described as ‘wrong friends’. One in the group introduced the rest to start smoking dagga. They absconded from school for 3 months to live with a certain Aunty Baby who owned a pub. Their intention was to go on a drinking spree. She made acquaintances at the pub during this time that paid for the drinks. The police located them, and they returned to the school. She was then introduced to mandrax and ended up using drugs. A Nigerian man abducted her from school and took her to an unknown location where she was kept. She stated that they forced her to smoke drugs after being assaulted.V2 described a certain Charles as one of the Nigerians from Vereeniging who sold girls. She regarded him as her boss who was nice and believed at the time she was in love with him. Charles sold her to a person called Austin. He became her boss and she was attracted to him. According to her evidence she also fell in love with Austin and had a sexual relationship with him. She began working as a prostitute for Austin under threat that her family will be harmed. She was sold back to Charles after Austin made a girl pregnant. Both Austin and Charles had drug dealings. Thereafter Charles sold her for R5000.00 to a person called Allaji. She described Allaji as one of the big bosses from Nigeria. His street name was Kenneth. She was taken to his flat at an unknown location and put to work as a prostitute. He already had 5 girls working as prostitutes. All of them were beaten up. He had a hold over her because of the drugs he supplied to her and expected her to pay him back from her earnings as a prostitute. She was also given a ‘wake up’ drug in the morning, in the afternoon and a ‘sleeper’ doze at night. Her addiction to crystal meth led to severe cravings.    Initially she worked on the streets and was then photographed and advertised on the internet offering sexual services. She was 16 at that stage. The clients would call her directly and make a booking. After they paid her, the money was handed to Allaji. After 5 years she managed to escape. After staying a week with her aunt, she arranged to meet a certain person called Moody whom she earlier knew. She arranged to meet him in Johannesburg but encountered a certain person called Chooks instead. Chooks, who was also Nigerian showed an interest in her and offered that she stays with him. He brought her to Pretoria and that is how she met the accused and the first complainant V1. They were living in a one room flat with a bathroom. Chooks left her there and returned to Johannesburg. It was V1 who told her that Chooks had sold her to the accused. She smoked rocks with V1. Because V1 had to see a client, she waited with the accused in another outside room. The accused told her that he loved her and wished to sleep with her. She refused. The accused again made sexual advances towards her which she again refused. He then forced himself on her, removed her clothes, put on a condom and had sexual intercourse with her against her will. She stated that at this moment, she ‘switched off’ which was understood to mean that she did not resist and she said because she felt nobody cared. She had an experience of being raped as a 13-year-old at gun point. She did not seek help from V1 because she sensed that V1 was as afraid of the accused as she was. Even the next morning, although V1 came across the condom in the bin, she did not disclose that she was raped, as she feared for her life. The accused arranged for Estcourt South Africa to photograph her. Pictures were taken of her in her underwear posing in different provocative positions. The pictures were paid for by the accused and she received many clients in response to the advertisement.The accused fixed her service rate at R400.00 for half an hour and R800.00 for an hour’s sex. The money earned was handed to the accused. She was given a cell phone to make the bookings. She did not contact her Aunt because she did not have her number. She was too scared to run away from the accused. She recalled how she was beaten by Allaji.She also narrated the events relating to further incident when the accused raped her. This happened during the evening shortly before the accused was arrested for the present case. She had earlier seen a client and called the accused to give him the money. He came by 6pm and wanted to have sex with her. She refused. He then forced himself on her and had sexual intercourse with her in the same manner as he did before. In exchange for the money she earned he gave her a ‘sleeper’ drug. She stated that it had been part of the rules she knew living with the Nigerians that all the money was given to them or you would be beaten up. The accused also threatened to assault her, and she feared that if she refused to work for him, her life would be in danger. Food in the house was scarce and sometimes she ate once a day.She was not allowed to go anywhere, and clients contacted her by cell phone. The language she used in court when describing the accused showed an intense hatred she bore for what he put her through. When asked if she though V1 feared the accused, her answer was a ‘deadly yes’. Apart from seeing clients, she also had to clean the house. The three weeks she lived there, she saw up to 5 clients a day. At times, she made up to R4000.00 a day for the accused.She was wearing a very revealing outfit before the police arrived. The accused bought that outfit because he wanted her to look sexy for clients. When the police knocked on the door, she hid the glass pipe and the drug pieces, were flushed down the toilet. She was high on drugs at the time and had consumed alcohol. Warrant officer Qegu took her to the bathroom where she showed her what she had hidden. She was hysterical at this stage. The officer asked her to pack her things and covered with a blanket. When they got to the car, she saw V1 hiding in the car. They were then taken to a safe house where they stayed for 6 months.Testimony of Warrant officersWarrant officers Qegu and Sithole testified about the events, which led to the arrest of the accused and the rescue of the 2nd complainant. Both officers were part of the Hawks unit and specially trained to work in the field of human trafficking. Qegu was with Sithole when they were assigned to attend to a case at Pretoria North Children’s Court. Qegu testified that she and Sithole attended court and met with magistrate Hitchcock who had made the report for police intervention. They also met V1, the 1st complainant there. She informed them how she and the 2nd complainant were being kept by the accused as sex workers against their will. The officers went to this venue after V1 made a call to establish that the accused was there. V1 pointed out the house but remained hidden in the vehicle. Before gaining entry to the accused premises she warned the girl inside not to run away as they were the police. The accused took some time to let them in.Except for a pair of pants, the accused was naked. The other person in the room was V2, who was very scantily dressed sitting on the bed drinking a beer. Because of the way the victim was dressed she took her to the bathroom whilst Sithole dealt with the accused. She described V2’s condition as being in a state of shock, disorientated and mostly incoherent. It appeared as if she was drunk or on drugs and was laughing for no reason. In the bathroom, V2 told her that shortly before the accused had given her drugs, which she smoked, he had sexual intercourse with her without consent. The accused told her to flush the rest of those drugs down the toilet when the officers knocked on the door. A glass pipe was found in the bathroom cabinet, which was placed in a sealed forensic exhibit bag. On inspection, a trace of a white powder-like substance was detected on the toilet seat. There was no food in the fridge.Both complainants were taken to a safe house and the accused was taken to the Brooklyn police station where he was charged the following day. The complainants were taken for medico legal examinations on the 14 May 2013 being the first available date. At the safe house, both complainants showed signs of drug withdrawal symptoms. V1 had red rashes on her body and V2 required specialist examination of her stomach. She arranged for victim impact reports to be compiled by police psychologist Major Stollarz.The witness stated that she booked out the exhibit bag of the evidence collected on the scene and took to the laboratory for forensic analysis. The analysis determined that it contained cocaine. The witness attempted to verify the address in Thembisa furnished by the accused where he allegedly worked. It led them to a Gold Exchange business. The owner, who also happened to be Nigerian, was questioned and he stated that he did not know the accused.Also booked into the SAP 13 register were all cell phones recovered from the accused and victims. These were sent for the data to be downloaded. The witness concluded her testimony by referring to a set of documents, some of which she obtained from V1 and some of which were found at the accused residence. These related to placement advertisements for sexual services under different names with deposit slips and receipts as proof of payment made to Sex Trader and Escort SA. All exhibits were handed in free of objection from the defence. In cross-examination, it was put to the witness that the accused knew nothing about the glass pipe, had not seen it before and did not hand it to V2. The witness’s explanation for the delay in taking V2 for a medico legal examination was that the events fell over a weekend and she stayed alone with her child. No other officer was available to take her to the doctor. It was put to the witness that the rape allegation was made only to make the case look stronger; the accused never had sexual intercourse with the victim on the day in question. He maintained that there was food in the fridge. It was also put to her that the accused would say that he had no knowledge of the documents relating to the advertisements in Sex Trader and Escort SA and saw them for the first time in court. He denied that the cell phone numbers appearing on the receipts were his.Warrant Officer Sithole’s testified and his evidence was in line with that of the testimony of Qegu. He confirmed that on meeting V1 she informed them that from 2009 the accused forced her to stay with him and used her as a sex worker. He stated that he did notice that the complainant was wearing lingerie and struggling to walk. Qegu took her into the bathroom. She was talking loudly, laughing and he did not find anything on the accused’s possession. In cross-examination, Sithole stated that Qegu informed him about the glass pipe she found when they were leaving the scene. After obtaining the accused’s consent, the witness read the accused’s entire Warning Statement, which he took on the day following the arrest into the record and it was received into evidence.As a follow-up to the Warning Statement he enquired and was informed by V1 that it was the accused who took away her motor bike. Under cross-examination and according to the witness’s recall, V2 told them that the accused had just finished raping her when they entered the room. It was also put to Sithole that the reason for the delay in having the medical examination done was to find something to link the accused to the offence. The defence introduced into evidence a map and set of photographs of the accused’s residence in Sandalwood Road for the purposes of showing the walking distance from the complex to the security point and the shopping centre.Testimony of the clinical psychologistMajor Stollarz, a clinical psychologist, testified as an expert witness. She adduced evidence based on a victimology report, which she complied at the request of the state. The purpose of her report and evidence was to assist the court in understanding the behaviour of victims of human trafficking from a psychological point of view, and to do so about the two complainants in the case. The conclusion she reached in her report was that ‘the complainants in the present matter were both, due to a number of developmental factors and traumas, and their abuse of substances, vulnerable to becoming victims of human trafficking. During the time that led up to their rescue they were subjected to witnessing and experiencing physical and sexual violence, threats, and encouragement of their addictions. Neither complainant wished to remain in the environment that they were in, but believed that they were unable to leave due to a number of psychological factors regarding the accused control over them, which included their fear of their own, or their families’ safety, substance addiction and lack of other viable alternatives. These victims were therefore exposed to the typical mechanisms used by traffickers to keep their victims in a web of trafficking that extended beyond the mere physical control to the expansive grip of psychological control’. There was no challenge to her testimony – the defence recorded that the accused had no objections and she was not cross-examined on her evidence. No additional psychiatric or other expert evidence was presented to the court.Statements of the accusedThe accused testified that he was born in Nigeria and came to South Africa in 2006. He entered South Africa on a visitor’s permit and later sought asylum as a refugee to reside legally in the country. One day, he met V1 by chance whilst walking in Sunnyside. He stopped her and spoke to her. She told him she was divorced, had one child and stayed in Pretoria North with her parents. She also informed him that she was a prostitute working on the streets, as she needed money to buy drugs. He told her it was ok because he loved her. He told her he liked her and wanted her to be his girlfriend. She agreed, and they began dating. They were in a relationship and she once slept over at his place. She took him to her home to meet her parents and they became very close. She also wanted to stay with him in Sunnyside and he agreed.By the end of 2009, they began living together. The accused stated that because he worked in Thembisa, he would leave home in the morning and return in the evening. He suspected that for the first 3 months together she continued being a prostitute because she was not home in the evenings. When he confronted her about this and she left to live with her parents. In this time, the accused informed her that he had moved to live in Faerie Glen. She returned to live with him and he did not want her engaging in prostitution anymore. She returned to live with her parents and began working as a receptionist for about 4 months. They continued seeing each other during this time and she was expecting his child in 2010. She alternated between staying with the accused and her parents. After giving birth, he visited the baby at her parent’s home. During February 2011 she brought the baby over and stayed with the accused for 2 weeks before going back to live with her parents. The accused then moved to live with a friend in Loskop Street. During this time, he was sending money to her using Shoprite money market. The reason she stayed there was because she had a sickly daughter. During 2013, she called him from Sunnyside for financial help as she had pawned her motor bike to buy drugs. He paid to have this bike released and she began living with him. He kept her bike away from her to avoid her using it again to obtain drugs. However, he allowed her to use it to visit her parents. V1 then returned to her parent’s home and the accused moved to live in Sandalwood Drive. Two months later, she called him to get directions to his new residence. They began living happily together once again. He had no idea what she whilst he was at work.One day she asked for money to place an advert offering her sexual services as she was bored staying alone and did not want to work on the streets. He refused. Two days later, he saw receipts for payments from newspapers and the internet relating to such adverts. He confronted her, and she confirmed that these related to her. He started discovering used condoms in the house and realised she was still engaging in prostitution. Although he wanted her to leave, he allowed her to stay on out of love. There was a time when her mother visited on a Sunday and they all spent time together. She even accompanied them to the mall and did shopping. He always ensured there were groceries in the house and they lived happily without any problems as ‘boyfriend and girlfriend’.Regarding the main charge of human trafficking, he maintained that V1 was his girlfriend with whom he had a child and they were in love. She was in contact with her family. They shared a bond. She had keys to the premises and could come and go as she pleased. He had his own business from which he made money and provided for her and their child. The income from managing the sale of broken gold and diamonds business brought in a high profit. At times he earned up to R10 000.00 a month and he also got money from gambling.  This enabled him to pay the rent, buy a car and see to his expenses. He received no money from her and earned no money off her. He had never supplied her with drugs and had no idea how and from where she got it. On a question by the court at the end of his testimony, he admitted that she told him she bought “rocks” from Arcadia or Sunnyside. She used drugs without him knowing or seeing her use it. She engaged in prostitution only to buy drugs, as there was always food in the house. Only on one occasion, did he see and become aware that a client came to the house for sexual favours. He denied ever having assaulted her.Regarding V2, he stated that he knew her boyfriend Chooks and that is how he met her. Chooks had moved to Pretoria from Johannesburg and was looking out for a place where his girlfriend could live for a while. Both he and V1 agreed that V2 could stay with them. According to his evidence, she was only there for 3 weeks. He was aware that she was originally from Vereeniging, but was staying in Johannesburg. He denied having bought V1 from his friend and stated that had no personal relationship with her. He had no knowledge that she was a prostitute or that she was advertised on the internet as he was not home most of the time. He also knew nothing about her drug addiction and denied having supplied her with any drugs. He strongly denied the allegations that he had raped her on two occasions and did not know why she said this. According to him, V2 was surprised and questioned the police as to why the accused was being arrested, as V1 was the accused’s boyfriend. For days after his arrest, the police also mention nothing concerning a charge of rape. He got to know for the first time of such charge in court.According to him, if the police found a pipe in the bathroom they would have shown it to him and asked for an explanation. He denied that any drugs were found by the police.In cross-examination, it emerged that he came on a visiting visa, and did not apply for a business one although he started his own business at the end of 2006. He could not say with certainty when he obtained his asylum permit or where his passport was. He could not explain why his brother at the gold exchange business told the police he was not working there. Thereafter he was examined regarding V1’s version and his responses were a denial, either that he had no knowledge or could not comment on it. He did confirm that V1 explained to him and he knew what “rocks” were, but he had not seen these drugs. At first, he stated that he noticed a change in her behaviour when she used drugs and he knew exactly when she was using drugs because she broke out into boils on her face and body. He had often seen her in a drugged state. Under later examination, he stated that she never showed any difference in behaviour if she did not use drugs. He held the belief that no person addicted to drugs could be controlled and that a drug addict could stop taking drugs anytime they chose unless they liked taking drugs.Regarding V2, his earlier testimony was that he had no knowledge that she was a prostitute or that she was advertised on the internet as he was not home most of the time. Under cross-examination, he stated that V1 informed him that V2 had joined her on the internet. Although he stated that he never saw her",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"The appellant's version was that she met the three complainants on the beach near Maputo in Mozambique where the complainants worked as prostitutes. They told her that they wanted to work as prostitutes in South Africa. She then agreed to accommodate the complainants as prostitutes in Pretoria where she resided. The appellant had a hair salon in the central business district of Pretoria where she also sold clothing. From the evidence, it is clear that the appellant knew the complainants from Mozambique. The appellant commuted between Pretoria and Mozambique regularly to visit and sell clothing. When she returned from Mozambique after one of her trips and while the appellant was in Pretoria, one of the complainants phoned the appellant and said that they were near Komatipoort. The appellant testified that she then asked a friend of hers to transport the complainants to Pretoria. When they arrived in Pretoria, the three complainants stayed with the appellant in her flat in Silver Lakes, east of Pretoria. The flat was too small and the appellant decided to rent a 3-bedroom house in Moreleta Park, a short distance from her flat. A brothel was kept at that house. The appellant was arrested and some of the complainants were taken into custody there. The Regional Magistrate rejected the appellant's evidence on grounds of credibility. Her rejected evidence only differed from that of the complainants in respect of the complainants' alleged prostitution in Mozambique and the collection of the complainants near Komatipoort. The balance of the evidence that led to the appellant's conviction (which she never challenged on appeal) was based to a large extent on circumstantial evidence. The evidence of the complainants was accepted. Their evidence was that they did meet the appellant in Mozambique where she promised them work in her hair salon and an opportunity to study while working there. They were looking for a better life. She then arranged for them to come to South Africa and the appellant in person collected all three of them at or near Komatipoort. The complainants testified that they worked for the appellant at her hair salon in Pretoria for a few days. They were forced to smoke cannabis and to have sexual intercourse with several men daily. They said they were not paid for doing so.One of the complainants returned to Mozambique before the appellant's arrest. She returned because she refused to perform all the sexual acts demanded by the appellant's elderly male clients. She was whisked away from the appellant's establishment and transported by taxi to Mozambique. She was given a passport containing the photograph of another individual to pass through immigration counters at the border posts. The passport was, when she was dropped off in Maputo, taken back by the taxi driver. After she reported her ordeal to her boyfriend and family in Maputo (her boyfriend gave evidence in the Court a quo) they went to the Mozambican Police to report the incident. After having reported the incident, the policeman to whom it was reported demanded payment of money from the victim and her relatives and boyfriend before he would conduct an investigation. The investigation only later followed after the victim and her boyfriend contacted a senior police official in Mozambique who then, in collaboration with the South African Police Service, secured the appellant's prosecution.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence

"The accused, Mr Veeran Palan and Ms Edwina Norris are charged with ten (10) counts which include: Count 1 and 2 is the illegal and intentional trafficking for sexual of complainant 1 and 2 in contravention of section 71(1) of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and related Matters) Amendment Act, 32 of 2007.Count 3 is the illegal keeping of a brothel in contravention of S2 of the Sexual Offences Act 23 of 1957.Count 4 and 5 is the charge of procuring the two complainants to have unlawful carnal intercourse with someone else in contravention of s a, b, and C of s10 of the sexual Offences Act 23 of 1957Count 6 is knowingly acquire, possess or use the illegal proceeds from acts of prostitutionCount 7 and 8 is kidnappingCount 9 and 10 is conspiring with an unidentifiable person to commit sexual offence. The crime of trafficking was prosecuted in terms of section 70 of the Sexual Offences Act, 32 of 2007. The Prevention and Combatting of Trafficking in Persons Act 7 of 2013 was assented to by the President of the Republic of South Africa on 28 July 2013 but had not been enacted. The first complainant CB is a 29 year old wife and mother of four young children, testified that during 2013 she was living with her husband and four children in Cape Town. She was unemployed and with a grade 10 education it was difficult to find a job. During July 2013 accused 2’s mother approached her with a cell phone and said that accused 2 wanted to speak to her. She had known accused 2 for some 12 years because they had been at school together and lived in the same street. She knew that accused 2 was working away from her family home. Accused 2 offered her a job as a cleaner in a Margate hotel in KZN. CB was keen to earn an income and undertook to speak to her husband. Accused 2 promised to phone her again with more details. CB’s husband did not have a good feeling about the offer. Accused 2 thereafter phoned again and told CB that Vees, her employer, would buy her a ticket to travel to KZN by bus. CB arranged with her mother to take care of the children. Her mother undertook to obtain more information about the job from accused 2 and also from Vees. Later that day accused 2’s mother called CB to her again and she was shown a photograph of accused 2 in what appeared to be a waitress’s uniform. This finally persuaded CB to accept the job offer and she contacted accused 2 to tell her. She enquired about the salary she would receive and accused 2 told her that she would hear when she was there. CB spoke to her husband about the job offer and although he was initially not happy to let her go but told her that she could if she wanted to. He too had spoken to accused 2.  On the 17th July 2013 she received a bus ticket confirmation by text from Vees. He also advised her that SN second complainant, also from Cape Town, would accompany her. She knew SN. CB’s father searched the Internet and reported that there was a Margate hotel in the Port Shepstone area. She now was convinced that all was above board with the job offer.  The next morning her mother took her to the bus terminus in Cape Town and travelled with SN to Port Shepstone. During the journey she stayed in telephonic contact with her mother and with Vees. They arrived in Port Shepstone on the 19th July 2013 at 9.30 in the evening and phoned accused 2. Vees, who turned out to be accused 1, was there to pick them up. He took them to his home. She had no idea where the hotel was that she was to work at. She had never been to KZN. Accused 1’s wife was at the house and she showed the two women their bedrooms, told them to bath before they would have something to eat and said that accused 2 was still at work and would be there shortly. Accused 2 arrived with two other ladies, J and M. Accused 2 was not in a waitress uniform but like the other two ladies she was scantily dressed. CB and SN thought they were dressed like prostitutes. Accused 1 made them sit down at a table and then disclosed to them that they were in fact not there to work in a hotel but that they would work as prostitutes; that accused 2 and the other ladies worked for him as sex workers. He said that CB and SN had no option but to do it as well since they needed to pay for the bus tickets he had provided. It had cost R1200 apiece. CB did not know what to say. She was nervous because she had noticed a handgun tucked into the back of accused 1’s trousers. Prostitution was however unacceptable to her. Accused 2 did not say anything either. She asked accused 2 what was to happen and accused 2 apologized for having lied to CB and SN. She explained that she had to find a replacement for herself before she would be allowed to return to Cape Town. This was confirmed by accused 1.      Accused 1 wanted them to start working that very night but CB and SN said that they were too tired. CB sent her mother a text on her cell phone after 1 am to tell her what had happened. After breakfast the next morning accused 2 took them to a shopping centre and bought them provocative clothing and underwear. That afternoon they were taken to the house of accused 1’s friend, a Dr M where they were entertained with food and alcohol. In the meantime CB’s uncle S phoned SN’s phone. He wanted to know where CB was finding herself but she was unable to give any directions. That evening the women were told to put on the clothes and underwear bought for them. Four men arrived at the house and the five women were told to stand in a line. The other women were each picked by a man (including accused 2) and CB considered herself fortunate that no-one picked her. She remained in the dining room while the others went to the bedrooms for sex. J was the first to return and she received a call about a stag party. When the other women were done, accused 1 drove the six of them to a Lodge at the Crocodile farm. Five men approached accused 1 and enquired how much the party and the girls would cost. Accused 1 advised them that it would cost R1000 for a stripping session and R350 for half an hour with a girl. There were many men at what turned out to be a bachelor party. An Indian man approached CB for sex. He paid accused 1 R400 and took CB to a room. She however disclosed to him that she was not a prostitute and how it had happened that she landed up there. She made it clear that she did not want him to have sex with him. The man undertook to help her and they conversed. Accused 1 arrived after a while and said that time was up and the man had to leave. Accused 1 drove the girls, except for accused 2 who stayed at the party, back home. On the way J was dropped at Dr M’s house. There was further business and four men arrived. This time CB was chosen by one of the men. SN was also chosen but said she did not feel good about it. The man took CB to a room and again she explained that she was not a prostitute and that she was there against her will. The man said he just wanted to converse and did not want sex although he had paid accused 1 R350. CB and the man conversed and when they left the bedroom they found accused 1 and Samantha arguing. At that moment CB’s mother phoned accused 1. Accused 1 told her that CB was at work but her mother had heard CB’s voice and accused 1 then told her they had just arrived from work. Although he was angry he passed the phone to CB but remained in attendance. As a result CB was unable to tell her mother what was happening. She said to her mother that everything was fine and that she could contact her in the morning. Accused 1 was upset about the phone call because he felt that CB’s mother was messing with his business. He threatened CB. She did not end the call with the result that her mother could hear how accused 1 was arguing with her and SN.     Between 3 and 4 am accused 1’s son and two other youngsters arrived at the house. Accused 1 did not want his son to see him; so accused 1’s wife (who happened to be a lady of Chinese origin) attended to business. Accused 1’s son went to sit in the car outside and a 17 year old boy paid her R400 to have sex with CB. Once they were in the bedroom CB disclosed to the prospective customer that she did not want to engage in prostitution and did not want to have sex with him. The youngster insisted and removed her clothes and told her to give him a condom. When she would not, he took one from a table in the room, put it on and told her to lie down. She resisted but he pushed her onto her back on the bed and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her. Although she pushed him off her, he mounted and penetrated her once again. She managed to push him off once again and he left the room and complained to accused 1. Accused 1 came into the bedroom and told her that he would see her in the morning. The next morning accused 1 confronted her and SN. He was rude and said they owed him R250 each for the food consumed by them as well as another R100 for advertising their bodies on the Internet. They were also to pay for their accommodation. From the R150, R100 and R50 respectively which he had given her for having been with three customers, she gave him R200. Accused 2 suggested that they be taken to a pub but accused 1 did not want them to go out and drink. Accused 2 then lied to him and said they were going out to eat and go to the cinema. Four of them took a taxi to a pub and enjoyed a few drinks and the outing. Uncle S again phoned SN who then enquired from others what the name of the pub was and conveyed this to Uncle S. At that point accused 2 was outside with another man. Half an hour later two police officers arrived. One had a photograph of CB which uncle S had sent to them. He took CB and SN with him to the police station in Port Shepstone where they made statements. At some point accused 2, accused 1 and his wife arrived. Accused 1 demanded to know why the police had taken the women there. CB identified accused 1 to the police and he was arrested. Then they enquired which one was Bonnie and when accused 2 was pointed out, she too was arrested. CB and SN were taken to accused 1’s house to fetch their clothes. Accused 1s wife allowed them to. According to CB she had been afraid of accused 1 and his firearm and the manner in which he talked to them and therefore had not made an attempt to leave the house earlier. They were also watched by accused 1 and his wife. On one of the three occasions when she was picked by customers, she was too scared to refuse. One look at accused 1’s face persuaded her to oblige.  Her understanding was that while accused 1 made all the arrangements with men, his wife managed the prostitutes. She saw him receive all the money.      When asked in the course of cross-examination why she had not run away from the house of accused 1, she told the court that she was afraid to do so. She thought accused 1 to be well-connected and she did not know whom to trust. She at one point said that she could not think clearly The court found that the evidence clearly showed that accused 1 and 2 had employed deception to lure the two complainants to Port Shepstone for the purpose of getting them to engage in prostitution and provided the finances and means of transferring them here. They were also harboured and accommodated by accused 1. The women did not freely and with full knowledge of all the material facts consent thereto. Consequently both accused are found guilty of the main counts of trafficking, illegal keeping of a brothel, procuring the victims to have unlawful carnal intercourse, knowingly acquire, possess or use the illegal proceeds from acts of prostitution (accused 2 was acquitted of this charge) and kidnapping. The second accused were acquitted on count 9 and 10.  Accused 1 was sentenced to 10 years and a fine of R10,000 or 5 months imprisonment. Accused 2 was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"The defendant, a 28 year old man, arranged a customary marriage with the complainant’s uncle which led to her abduction. The complainant was, at the time, 14 years old. The custom of abducting girls for the purposes of marriage, sometimes with the permission of their family, is known as ukuthwala in South Africa. The complainant was restrained and transported to the defendant’s village. She attempted to escape two times, and was successful the second time in arriving back to her village, but was subsequently apprehended by her uncle and returned to the defendant. She was then beaten and raped eight times, and was locked in the house when the defendant and his relatives were going out.

"With the exception of victim LK (counts 5 and 6), who was abducted under false pretences, three girls; JC, CM and AC (mentioned in counts 1-4 and 6-8), all under the age of 16 at the time, were through misrepresentations made to them and their parents lured to South Africa by a certain ‘Aunt Juliet Chauke’  to visit family and / or with the promise of their attending schools and obtaining a better education than what they could get in Mozambique. Accused no 2, Violet Chauke, is Juliet’s younger sister, while Alice Chauke, AC’s mother was Juliet’s elder sister.  According to the uncontested evidence of these children, Juliet Chauke, who has since disappeared back into Mozambique and never charged in this matter, has also ‘trafficked’ her younger sister Violet Chauke, to South Africa in a similar way, but, later, when she became adult, she got a work and remained in South Africa.JC was sent by her parents with Juliet and others to come and visit over the school holidays – also with a promise that she would return, which never happened. When she asked Juliet why she is not going back, she said that there was no money. AC was sent by her mother, Juliet’s and Violet’s elder sister to South Africa with a promise of better schooling, which never materialized – but she was never allowed to return. LK was abducted under false pretences after her primary care giver, her grandmother, refused Juliet permission to bring her to South Africa for better schooling. Later, however, Juliet found her on the way and told her that her grandmother had now agreed and, she was then made to accompany Juliet and others. She was also never enrolled at school in South Africa and not allowed to return. CM came to South Africa with Juliet in the presence of her own mother, Alice and her younger sister JM and others. The purported reason for their trip was to visit family members over the school holidays, after which they would return. Her mother returned, but she and her sister remained behind. When the mother later phoned and asked when they would be sent back, Juliet said that there was no money for that and that she would enrol them at school in South Africa. JC, AC and LK were brought to South Africa in 2009, while CM was brought during 2010.Since none of them had valid passports, all of them were at different occasions smuggled over or through the border fence with South Africa, while Juliet used the border gate with a valid passport. On the other side of the border they were met by Juliet and other people, (sometimes a man perceived to be Juliet’s husband) and they were eventually transported to the place called Makostering (Rhenosterhoek) plantation village. This lumberjacks’ village is a very remote place with no direction or information boards, and a stranger would find it difficult to find the place without help and would experience true desolation if left there without food or shelter. A desolated place indeed, and if a stranger was brought there and chased away, as some of these children were threatened should they not do what they were told, they would literally not have anywhere to go.Once resident in one of the small houses in the village, these girls were at different times, sometimes in the presence of others, taken (or sent) by Juliet, or fetched by accused no 1, to a larger house, about 1.5 kilometres away from the village, which reportedly belonged to accused no 1, the manager of the plantation / timber farm, and which was used as a residence by him. All of these witnesses described how they were then from time to time made to enter the bedroom, where they would be undressed (either by Juliet or accused no 1), or, later when they got used to it, they themselves did so, and they were also raped by accused no 1 on these occasions. All of them, with the exception of JC, who was raped only once, were raped several times according to their evidence. Each time they were being taken to the larger house by Juliet, or, later when they got used to their being exploited in this way, called or sent (by Juliet or, in her absence, by Violet, accused no 2) to go and attend accused no 1’s sexual pleasures. Sometimes he would pay Juliet, sometimes he would give them money to give to either Juliet or Violet, accused no 2. JC said that, when she was subsequent to her rape called to Mabuza’s house, she told the messengers that they should tell him that she is in her periods so that she did not have to go, and thus she evaded being raped a second time.Three of them (AC, CM and JC) testified that they were during the first time threatened by accused no 1 with a fire arm should they not do what he says. Some of them (excluding only AC who was at the very first time forced to do so) at first refused to sleep with Mabuza, accused no 1, after which they were threatened by Juliet that they would be chased away, that they would not have anywhere to go or food to eat and, sometimes food like meat would be refused. This motivated the children to simply do as they were told.It further emerged from the evidence of the children that there were times that Juliet would be absent – on her errands to Mozambique to traffick others or, simply to visit – and that the children would then be left in the care of her younger sister, Violet, accused no 2. From time to time, when Mabuza wanted to see one of them, he would phone Violet when she would ready them and send them to him (or he would come and fetch them), where they would be raped as before. Sometimes he would give them money that they had to give to accused no 2. During these times, Violet would care for them (harbour them) by giving them food, whilst fully knowing what they were there for and she would ready them and send them to accused no 1 at his request. All of the girls knew all too well they would be left destitute if they did not do as told.The history described by some of the children about accused no 2, Violet, who was also trafficked (by her own elder sister) to South Africa for the sexual pleasure of accused no 1, shows that, when Violet became too old for his attentions, she got a work in the plantation at Rhenosterhoek, and that Juliet then had to go and look for new young blood to come and replace her.One of the things that disturbed the children the most, was that, whenever they reported to Juliet that the accused had injured their private parts during the rapes, and that they bled, she did not respond or help them in any way. To AC she simply said that she would be alright and she would get used to it eventually. To the contrary, when they verbalised their unwillingness to be subjected to rape, or when they subsequently complained and appeared to be unwilling, Juliet threatened them with abandonment in this desolate place, where all of them were strangers. When they requested to be sent back, Juliet always indicated that there was no money. When they enquired about being sent to school, there was no money. To LK she said that she had to sleep with accused no 1 to get money to buy school uniforms. All this while they were related to Juliet, or knew her well enough to view her in a position of authority and trust and who seriously betrayed the trust of the children.One day, JC decided to pack her things and run away from there and, at school, she was found out. The principal and the social worker, Lucia Sonya Khoza were summoned to speak to her. The most that they got out of her was that the other children that she left behind on the farm at Rhenosterhoek was being maltreated and sexually abused. When this was reported to the principal and the social worker, reports were made to the police, which led to Ramodike and others going to the village, where the other children were found. They were in a bad shape, clothes in tatters and dirty, their hair unkempt and in dreadlocks, and they were clearly very hungry.This is where the investigation started. The investigation, before the matter was handed over to Nyathi, was however poorly done. Accused no 1 and Violet were arrested only much later. The particular house in which the incidents reportedly happened was never searched. Accused no 1’s fire arm was only later seized. Etcetera. The children were however put in a place of safety and, eventually, when they properly disclosed what happened statements must have been taken from them, which led to the case being investigated with a view to prosecute and the institution of these proceedings.Accused no 1’s evidenceHe stated that he had worked for York Timbers, until he started his own business rendering contracting services to York Timber at Rhenosterhoek and Blystaan from 2001. Juliet Chauke had worked for his enterprise at Blystaan under a sub-contractor.He stated that the first time ever he saw accused no 2, was during 2011 or 2012, when she started working there as a general labourer. He never had any sexual relationship with accused no 2 or any of the children who testified, whom he did not even know. The first time he ever saw the children that testified, is when they appeared on the TV screen during their testimony. He does not know whether his employees could have family members visit or stay with them in the village, because that was York Timbers’ responsibility. If he wanted to employ more people, he had to ask York Timbers whether his people could use more houses in the village.He cannot deny that the children who testified were staying in that village from 2009 to 2012 as they said they did. He cannot dispute the ages that the children testified they were at the time, nor their reported dates of birth. He however said that he can dispute that the children were ever raped in the main house, because at the relevant time, 2009 to 2011, neither he nor anyone else lived there. He does not know how the children could know of the suite bathroom in the main bedroom to that house. He specifically denied that he ever wore the firearm to work from 2006 until the date of his arrest, and he could therefore not say how the children could have known that he even possesses a firearm. There has never been any bad blood between him and Juliet, or between him and Violet, that could have turned the kids against him. He cannot say whether any of the children could have harboured a motive to falsely implicate him with these serious allegations, but he had overheard that they might have thought that he had a lot of money and that they would get some money if they falsely implicated him. It was pointed out to him that this version of his did not fly, because none of the children, out of their own, laid a charge against him. This case was uncovered by social workers and the police, not by the children. He however insisted that all of them were lying, just to get him into trouble.Accused no 2’s versionAccused no 2 never testified, but her version that was put to the children was that she never had anything to do with their maltreatment, and that she only gave them shelter and food during the absence of Juliet. One or two of the children agreed with this, but others made it clear that, in Juliet’s absence, she pertinently readied them and sent them to accused no 1 at his telephonic requests, and that, at occasion, she received money from accused no 1 via them. These allegations by the children were never denied by her in evidence that could be tested through cross-examination for the veracity thereof.Examination of the victims by a forensic nurse and a medical doctorKok is a forensic nurse and Grabe a medical doctor and professor, who is an expert in dealing with the examination of victims, especially children in sexual assault cases. Kok saw injuries on the private parts of only certain of the girls that she examined, but was quick to add, which was confirmed by Grabe, that the absence of injuries does not necessarily exclude sexual penetration. She was however clearly inexperienced compared to Grabe, who saw more clear indications on the private parts of all the girls she examined that was indicative of sexual penetration of their genitals. This evidence serves to support the four complainants’ versions that they have been sexually penetrated. Of course, these witnesses could not say whether the children had been raped and by whom, although the lesions on their private part were indicative of tears that have healed, which suggested that at least some force had to be used to effect penetration. In her professional opinion based on scientific observations, Grabe, in addition, also put the relevant ages of the girls at the same level than the respective ages that they gave her and the court.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"Second accused, Lionel Richard Ball, had seen “groups of prostitutes” on the side of the road previously, and asked his domestic worker and co-accused, Nokuzola Ntonga, specifically to fetch V. for him. Evidently, amongst these “groups of prostitutes” stood young girls who were not prostitutes. V. was not a prostitute, and may have been a virgin.Ntonga went to fetch V. from her home, where she resided with her elder sister. V. had known Ntonga prior to the incident. V. was not home, but her sister told Ntonga that V. was at a friend or relative’s house. Ntonga then retrieved V. from the friend or relative’s house. Ntonga told V. and the caretakers of the house that she was taking V. to see a social worker to get shoes and clothes.Rather, Ntonga drove V. to Ball’s home in East London where Ball allegedly raped V. He then allegedly forced her into the shower and locked her in his bedroom when a friend and witness in the case, Raath, visited Ball’s house for a few hours. Raath testified that he did see a young black child, but did not know if she was a girl or what her purpose was of being there. After Raath left, Ball drove V. home. Ball admitted that she was at his home, but claims he only let her watch television, take a shower, and gave her clothes and R200 to purchase shoes.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"This case involved an urgent application by Mavericks Revue bar, a “gentlemen’s club” in Cape Town, to stop the Department of Home Affairs from terminating its corporate permits, pending a separate judicial review of the withdrawal of the permits. Mavericks Revue bar required the corporate permits in order to legally employ foreign dancers at the establishment.The background to the dispute was that Mavericks had applied to the Department in March 2010 to have 143 out of 200 corporate permits replaced, claiming that they were “lost, mislaid or stolen over many years”. In deciding whether to allow the application the Department learnt Mavericks had not complied with the relevant legislation and the conditions of the corporate worker authorisation certificates. It was claimed by the Department that Mavericks’ corporate workers were not employees but independent contractors who were not paid a wage or salary and that Mavericks’ failed to keep proper records, inform the Department when a worker left, ensure corporate workers complied with provisions of the legislation and ensure foreign workers departed after completion of their tour of duty. On the basis of these reasons, among others, the Department decided to withdraw the corporate permits.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"SummaryThe three defendants were found guilty on multiple counts relating to running an illegal enterprise which illegally harvested and exported abalones. In March 2019, they were sentenced to 15-18 years imprisonment.Illegal harvesting and trading of abalone have been a reason for concern in South Africa’s Eastern Cape since the 1990s. The seaside city Port Elizabeth is considered a hub for the illegal trade in abalone and has been declared to be a hotspot of criminal enterprises and kingpins. The numbers of abalone, which is mostly sold as delicacy to Asia, has been in decline, sparking the government to respond to the issue by establishing dedicated teams seeding abalone and patrolling the area.Details On 22 March 2015, a member of the South African Police Service observed suspicious activities while being on patrol along the coast heading towards Noordhoek. He observed individuals coming out of the water loading backs onto vehicles. He chased the vehicles and was able to arrest one suspect after a hot pursuit, encountering abalone on the suspect’s car. Another suspect working for the defendants was found in possession of abalone without a permit a month later. The South African Police Service launched an investigation into the operation of the defendants.The lead investigator described the illegal operations of the defendants as syndicate-like. While their enterprise relied on the support of several people, the defendants conducted their operations on a need-to-know basis, in which different participants in the supply chain would have limited knowledge about the overall operation. Abalones are being harvested by divers using diving equipment provided for by the accused. The harvested abalones would be packed and marked with an identification mark of the respective harvester. From there, the abalones would be loaded onto motor vehicles, from where a driver would take them to the “weight house”. In that station, the abalones would be sorted by size, had their shell removed and weighted. Based on their weight, the divers would be paid. Another driver would then take the abalones to another location where they would be stored in freezers. Yet another person would later pick them up to transport them to the processing plant, where the abalones get cleaned and cooked. Via the cities of Gauteng or Cape Town, the abalones would ultimately be shipped to China and sold as delicacy.",trafficking in firearms,Sentenced
"In January 2009, Peter Michael Roberts (accused 1) and six co-accused were arrested by the erstwhile Directorate of Special Operations (the Scorpions) following a police operation codenamed Operation May. The enterprise traded and distributed approximately 30 tons of shucked abalone over a period of 40 months. The State argued that Peter Roberts was the mastermind and that his co-accused were central to the enterprise.Two of the accused, who were arrested five kilometres from the Lebombo border post between South Africa and Mozambique, are not subject to this trial since both pleaded guilty and entered a plea bargain with the State. Both were convicted and sentenced but not incarcerated. The remaining five accused all denied complicity in the offences, which included conducting an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activities (2005 – 2009), in the illicit trade in and transportation of abalone – in a truck with a concealed roof – to Mozambique.The State demonstrated that Peter Roberts was indeed central to the enterprise by relying on witness testimony, documentary evidence obtained through a seizure operation, and transcripts from intercepted phone calls to and from Roberts. It was found that their operation possessed, transported, and exported abalone from the Eastern Cape to Mozambique. The illegal trade in abalone was the predicate offence to the more serious crime of racketeering, that carries a heavier sentence, which necessitated the State to demonstrate the existence of an enterprise with a pattern of more than two incidents and show the involvement of the accused in the enterprise. The racketeering pattern was established by triangulating the abovementioned evidence to cases in which s204 witnesses (see commentary) testified about the complicity of the accused in similar cases in which the witnesses were duly convicted and sentenced.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"3 individuals were charged in the criminal trial for manufacturing methamphetamine in contravention of the Drugs Act. The main accused S.P. was accused of operating a drug manufacturing laboratory from his residence. He owned the property. The State also brought civil forfeiture proceedings against the property which S.P., as the owner of the property, opposed.S.P. was criminally charged with contraventions of the Drugs Act. He was found manufacturing methamphetamine in a laboratory in his home. He was however acquitted of these charges on the basis of technical problems with a search and seizure warrant that led to the discovery of the laboratory. The State also brought civil asset forfeiture proceedings against the property on the basis that the property was used to manufacture drugs. This application was successful, notwithstanding several appeals, including an appeal to the Constitutional Court by S.P.The criminal proceedings and asset forfeiture proceedings were instituted simultaneously. S.P. brought an application to stay the civil forfeiture proceedings pending the finalization of his criminal case. He contended that the civil proceedings would violate his right to remain silent. This application was dismissed and forfeiture granted as the court found that the decision to oppose forfeiture of his property did not amount to a compulsion to speak in violation of his right to remain silent. S.P. had a choice to defend the forfeiture application or he could remain silent. The court held that it was not required to protect him from the consequences of exercising this difficult choice. The court ordered that the property be forfeited to the State on the basis that it was used to manufacture drugs in contravention of the Drugs Act.After his acquittal in the criminal case S.P. argued that the forfeiture was unfair as the criminal court had acquitted him of the charges. His property could therefore not be forfeited as the criminal court had not been satisfied that the crimes he was accused of were in fact committed. The appeal court found that the state had proved on a civil standard that the property was used to manufacture methamphetamine and the findings of the criminal court were irrelevant to the forfeiture proceedings.S.P. then appealed to the Constitutional Court asking the court to declare the forfeiture order an unfair violation of his fair trial rights (to remain silent, not to incriminate himself) and his right to property. He also ask the court to find that the lower court should have granted him a stay of the civil forfeiture proceedings pending. He was unsuccessful in his constitutional challenge and the property was forfeited to the State.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"This case mainly concerns the conduct of alleged human trafficking and facilitation to such crimes which was prosecuted by the High Court in Pretoria, South Africa. During the period 1 April 2016 up to September 2016, defendant 3, namely C.J. Obasi, harboured at least two victims at Jaspit Court with the alleged intent to exploit his victims sexually. Both of the victims who testified as witnesses before the Court were first brought to contact with the said defendant by their acquaintances. Prior to arriving at Jaspit Court, the victims had been living in vulnerable conditions resulting from irregular immigrant status, addiction to drugs, as well as complicated family issues. And such conditions were later taken advantage of by the traffickers to gain control over the victims. Although victims seemlingly came to Jaspit Court out of their free will, they were subsequently controlled with drugs, threatened by force, and repeatedly assaulted by the said defendant. The victims worked as prostitutes during such period of time but were forced to hand over all the incomes they had made. They also had to entertain “smoking clients”, visitors who come to consume drugs. It was also reported that the victims were pushed to have sexual intercourse with Obasi due to the hierarchical relationship between them. At the same time, the victim enjoyed little personal freedom: they were not allowed to go anywhere on their own during daytime, and later following a failed attempt to escape, they were not allowed to leave the flat at all during daytime.  While defendant 3, Obasi, carried out the major activities, defendant 1, namely Abba, was trained and served to run the “business” in the exact same manner during Obasi’s temporary absence. Defendant 2, Mkhonto, who had once been romantically involved with Obasi, leased to him the property in which the victims were harboured.

"From 2010 to 2014, the defendant Mr Z. conducted a criminal enterprise to fraudulently purchase goods on commercial websites.

"This case concerns an organized criminal group that used dating websites to scam victims in 2006.

Yahoo! warns users that they must abide by its rules and refrain from selling items and entering into prohibited transactions under the applicable domestic law.UEJF and LICRA, two French non-profit organizations fighting anti-Semitism (hereinafter the “Plaintiffs”), filed a civil complaint against Yahoo! US and Yahoo! France before the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris. UEJF and LICRA  alleged that Yahoo! allowed the posting of illegal items, including Nazi paraphernalia and Third Reich memorabilia, in violation of Article R645-1 of the French Criminal Code. This provision prohibits to “wear or exhibit” in public uniforms, insignias and emblems which “recall those used” by (i) an organisation declared illegal in application of Art. 9 of the Nuremberg Charter, or (ii) a person found guilty of crimes against humanity.The High Court of Paris, in its judgment of 22 May 2000, upheld the claim filed by UEJF and LICRA. The Court ordered Yahoo! US to take all the measures necessary to dissuade and prevent access to auctions for Nazi memorabilia and content supporting Nazism. The court ordered Yahoo! France to warn users that, should Yahoo!’s search results include content prohibited under French law, they shall refrain from accessing such content to avoid incurring legal sanctions.Yahoo! US and Yahoo! France challenged the competence of the High Court of Paris and, in any case, requested the court to reconsider its decision since compliance would be technologically impossible. However, on November 20, 2000, the High Court of Paris, after gathering expert opinions, reasserted its competence, confirmed its previous decision and established a 3-month deadline for compliance. As a result, Yahoo! amended its auction guidelines and warned its users that the sale of items prohibited under Article R645-1 of the French Criminal Code is not allowed.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced

"Subject of the case are legal proceedings initiated by Cédric H. and his colleagues to challenge the constitutionality of Articles L.622-1 and L 622-4 of the French Code on the Entry and Residence of Foreign Nationals and the Right to Asylum. The applicants claimed that the offence of facilitating the illegal entry, movement and residence of a foreign person infringed upon the principle of fraternity, as it did not sufficiently take into account humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants without material or financial compensation.The French Constitutional court, first of all, clarified that the principle of fraternity enjoyed constitutional value as it is enshrined in Art. 2 and 72-3 of the Constitution and, secondly, that it comprised the freedom to help one another without consideration as to whether the assisted person is legally residing within the French territory. On the other hand, the principle of fraternity must be balanced against the legislature’s responsibility to safeguard public order.  Applied to the legislation at hand, the Court found that criminalizing any assistance to irregular migrants, including when it is given for humanitarian reasons, did not strike a fair balance between the afore-mentioned principles and violated the constitutional provisions on fraternity. The Court, however, dismissed arguments based on the necessity and proportionality principles, legal certainty principle, protection of human dignity, and equality before the law which it considered not to be infringed upon by the legislation in question.",trafficking in firearms,Not Sentence
"The plaintiff, a woman of unknown age, established that she had been recruited and subjected to accommodation and work conditions contrary to human dignity by the two Respondents, a married couple for whom she worked, for their material benefit. The Plaintiff states that the Second Respondent had approached her with the promise that, if she came to work in France with the brother of the Second Respondent, she would receive a salary and would be able to follow literacy courses. The plaintiff was thus subjected to accommodation and working conditions which were contrary to her human dignity, as well as forced domestic servitude at the hands of – and for the benefit of - Respondents 1 and 2 over the period of October 2005 to November 2007. As found by the Court of Appeal of Versailles, Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code criminalising the trafficking in persons was modified by the Law 2007/1631 of November 20, 2007, changing the text of the Article from:         ‘Trafficking in persons is comprised of the recruitment, transportation, harbouring and reception of any person, for financial or other material benefit, to make said personavailable to a third party, even where said third party is not identified, in order to allow the commission of breaches of working or accommodation conditions against the person contrary to their human dignity.’To        ‘Trafficking in persons is the recruitment, transportation, harbouring or welcoming a person, for financial or other non-financial material benefit, in order to make them available to themselves or at the disposal of a third party, being identified or not, to enable to commission against the person of offences against the person resulting from their being subjected to working or accommodation conditions which are contrary to their human dignity.’ As such in the present case, from the period of the October 2005 to September 2008, the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in degrading conditions by the Respondents for their own benefit. Thus, as the Plaintiff had not been put at the disposal of a third party, from the period from October 2005 to November 2007 the Respondents could not be charged with trafficking in persons pursuant to the unamended text of Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code. Rather, the respondents are liable for having committed the lesser offence of subjecting a person to accommodation and work conditions contrary to their human dignity pursuant to Article 225-14 of the Penal Code. The Court of Cassation, held however, that on the facts the respondent had been put at the disposal of a third party. This notwithstanding, from 20 November, 2007 to 21 September, 2008, the Respondents could be prosecuted for having committed trafficking in persons for the period over which the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in conditions contrary to their human dignity for the benefit of the Respondents following the entry into force of the Law 2007/1631 of the 20 November 2007.",drug offences,Not Sentence
"The defendant was accused of facilitating the illegal transit and stay of three Eritrean female migrants (including a minor), who he knew were in France irregularly. The facts occurred on 18 October 2016, between Tende (France) and Nice (France), via La Turbie (Alpes Maritimes, France). The defendant provided transportation and accommodation in his residence to the three irregular migrants.On the afore-mentioned date, the police carried out a traffic control operation in highway A8, close to la Turbie, between 01.00 and 07.00. The defendant was ordered to pull over at approximately 04.45. Authorities realised the defendant was transporting three women, who attempted to hide their faces.The defendant was placed under custody. The search of the vehicle did not reveal anything pertinent to investigations. Later, authorities searched the residence of the defendant, where they found three matrasses placed on the floor and, in the kitchen, nine glasses and bowls as well as a pot with food.Two of the migrants were heard by authorities. One, declared to have fled Eritrea, via the Sahara desert. She went to Sudan and, then, Libya. From there, she left to Italy, by sea, with the assistance of migrant smugglers to whom she paid 3600 USD. She wouldbe attempting to arrive to Germany, where relatives of her resided. She stated to have encountered the defendant by chance, while she and her compatriots where walking towards France. The defendant would have stopped and, realising their tiredness, invited them into the vehicle, without charging them any fees or requesting any advantage in return.The other migrant confirmed the statement of her compatriot. She declared to have paid 3500 USD to be smuggled from Libya into Italy. She would have attempted before to walk towards Germany, in the company of her cousin. However, the latter would have been ran over by a truck and died. On her second attempt, she walked for several days, through the mountains, with her two compatriots. They would be in the process of walking when a vehicle stopped close to them. They asked the driver for help. The defendant accepted to give them a ride without asking any payment or benefit in return.The defendant, in turn, contested the version given by the migrants.  According to him, he had taken charge of the three women in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende (France), upon finding them in an abandoned building close to associations that aimed to provide humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants. He further explained to usually associate with members of such associations/organisations, particularly those intending to supply food and accommodation to migrants in need. He admitted to have witnessed several conversations without ever directly providing humanitarian assistance himself. However, two days before, while he was going to La Brigue to attend a popular celebration with his 12-year old daughter, he notice four young individuals, appearing to be African, and in inappropriate attire in view of the current season. He decided to stop, namely to sensitise his daughter to the difficulties endured by irregular migrants. He ended up conversing with the four young individuals (allegedly from Darfur), who declared to wish to travel to the coast. However, they were heading to the mountains. The defendant agreed to return at approximately 18.00 and help them. He did as agreed. He took the young men to his residence and gave them food and accommodation for the night. The next day, he gave them a ride to the station of Arcs (France) and paid them a train ticket to the station of Carnoules (France). Following these events, he went to work. At the end of the day, he joined some friends in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende (France). One of his friends informed him that a number of associations providing humanitarian assistance to irregular migrants intended to invest on a squat in order to ensure accommodation to those in need. This friend would have told the defendant that he would be helping in this endeavour. The defendant decided to accompany his friend to the site at approximately 01.00. After a while, given the late hour, the defendant manifested his intent to return home. One of the individuals on site, proposed that he took the three Eritrean women to his house and, the following day, gave them a ride to the station of Cagnes-Sur-Mer (France). There, they would take the train to Marseille (France) where they would be expected by doctors and other humanitarian workers. With some hesitation, the defendant accepted. He declared to be fully aware of the irregular situation of the women in France. Yet, he acted out of solidarity in view of their dramatic circumstances. He described that, when he met the women, they were tired, fearful and ‘frozen’. They presented apparent wounds and bandages. One of the three Eritrean women was again questioned, this time confirming the version of events reported by the defendant. The latter’s declarations were also corroborated by the analysis of his phone records. On the one hand, many of the defendant’s contacts were indeed individuals well known for their humanitarian work/involvement. On the other hand, a number of messages were illustrative of the defendant’s intent to help migrants in need, in the sense explained by him during questioning. They further supported the facts reported by the defendant. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence as well as the outcome of search and seizure operations. Expert evidence was also considered. Notably, a physician working with Médecins du Monde attested to the debilitating health conditions of the three Eritrean migrants: (i) they presented contusions, wounds, and sprains due to long hours walking; (ii) most concerning, their psychological state was particularly worrying. The expert further noted to be familiar with the squat in Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende, declaring it to be impossible to deny help, food, clothing and accommodation to the migrants settling therein. In addition, the Defence submitted an affidavit from President of the Ligue des droits de l’Homme(who was not heard in court due to time constrains), according to which the actions of the defendant were defined as “gestures of humanity and solidarity towards human beings in situation of total precariousness”. Legal findings:In responding to the humanitarian justification invoked by the Defence, the Public Prosecutor underlined the difference between ‘rescue’ and ‘aide’. The former implies an immediate danger and it is, hence, a duty. The actions of the defendant were to be integrated, instead, within a more organised help/assistance, which was not connected to a real and imminent danger to the life or safety of others. It thus maintained its argument for the conviction of the defendant for facilitation of illegal transit and stay of irregular migrants in France.The Tribunal de Grande Instance of Nice acquitted the defendant.For further details see “Commentary”.",drug offences,Sentenced

The offences were committed through an organised criminal group.  On 6 July 2009, the Sub-Directorate on the Fight against Irregular Migration and the Illegal Work of Foreigners (Sous-direction de la Lutte de l’immigration irrégulière et le travail illégale des étrangers) received an anonymous tip on the existence of a network of irregular migration. Defendant W.A.T. would be involved in it by ensuring the trip and arrival in France of migrants original from Mauritania, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Morocco, some of whom would be minors. As a result, authorities placed the residence of W.A.T. and himself under surveillance. On 9 July 2012, he was observed picking up two seemingly African individuals from the station of Austerlitz (Paris, France), who were arriving from Cerbère (France). The analysis of the data collected through the bugging of his mobile phones, revealed that (i) W.A.T. was often in contact with Morocco, (ii) migrants paid between 2500 and 3000 Euro per person. W.A.T.’s phone number often activated towers in airports Rossy Charles de Gaule and d’Orly (both in France). In August 2009, W.A.T. carried out several return trips between Spain and Morocco.The analysis of his computer data (which had also been bugged), provided evidence on the organisation of trips, recruitment of migrants, and methods used to obtain false documents. Authorities retrieved photographs in passport format, copies of passports, plane tickets reservations. In several emails, W.A.T. acknowledged and confirmed the arrival of several migrants in France, sometimes via Morocco.Electronic surveillance techniques permitted identifying several accomplices/members of the organised criminal group operating: (i) in France (five individual including the defendant B.E.F.) and abroad (four individuals, residing in the United Kingdom and Morocco).From December 2009 on, W.A.T. extended his migrant smuggling activities to Greece’s route. In this context, another accomplice, resident in Belgium, was identified. Physical and electronic surveillance confirmed these developments and attested to the arrival of at least two irregular migrants, via Greece. Conversations involving W.A.T. and his accomplices referred to “app. 20 migrants in Greece waiting for their trip to France”.Under questioning, W.A.T. declared inter alia that new arrivals in Morocco would receive a three months valid stamp on their passport. W.A.T. thus proposed to migrants the stamping of their passports in the terms explained, in exchange of 800 Euro. He declared to authorities that he would receive the payment and disappear before concluding any border crossing. Investigations revealed close connections with a police officer in Morocco. W.A.T. also admitted some involvement in the migrant smuggling venture via Greece. He denied additional criminal facts. B.E.F. was heard on the facts. He declared to be a child friend of W.A.T. He denied being involved in smuggling ventures, though W.A.T. would “have something to do with it”. B.E.F. admitted to facts attested by surveillance techniques, notably having supplied stolen passports and third parties’ passports to W.A.T. He later retracted some of these admissions. His involvement in the activities of the organised criminal group was supported by the declarations of other members thereof. In ascertaining the facts, authorities resorted to electronic surveillance (including interception of communications, computer bugging), searches and seizures, physical surveillance operations, declarations of defendants and witnesses. Legal findings:The defendants were charged by the Prosecution with  “assisting, though an organised criminal group, the irregular entry, transit or stay of a foreigner in France or in a State Party to the Schengen Agreement”.

"The judgment decides the appeal presented by an individual (D.T.P.) against his conviction for arranging, through an organised criminal group, marriages with the sole purpose of obtaining or procuring a residence permit or French nationality. The appellant was charged with arranging “approximately 30 marriages” with the purpose of obtaining or facilitating the issuance of residence permits in France or the acquisition of French nationality, during the period of 1 January 2002 to 31 January 2007. However, the accusation and appealed sentence refer in detail to 10 marriages from 21 August 2002 to 4 May 2004.The recruitment of French nationals to marry Cameroonian citizens took place in France while the marriages were celebrated in Denmark since the latter’s legislation did not require the presence of the spouses earlier than the day before the wedding.  The recruited brides were paid between 2000 and 4500 Euro. The marriages were organised via the intermediation of an enterprise based in Germany, which, in 2002-2004, perceived a significant increase of marriages between French and Cameroonians. The enterprise charged a fee of 350 Euro per wedding. Its owners declared that the appellant referred to them 1-2 couples per month, for which he received a fee of 50 Euro per marriage.It was ascertained this scheme operated through a number of intermediaries, who recruited the French nationals and transported them to Denmark, to celebrate the wedding, and then back to France.

The appellant was identified as “le Président” of this organisational scheme. Some witnesses indicated the appellant was present in preparatory meetings of the fraudulent marriages and directly engaged in the arrangement thereof. The wife of the appellant declared to have recruited six women on behalf of the defendant to marry African individuals based in Europe.

"The defendant – a priest – provided accommodation to irregular migrants in the Parish Centre of Montreynaud (France), property of the diocesan association, the president of which was the Bishop of Saint Etienne (France).He was accused of having breached the municipal regulation of 4 February 2013 that determined the closure of the establishment in question. It was argued against the defendant that the Parish Centre did not fully comply with regulations on public safety and sanitation. In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, including from the defendant. Legal findings:The Prosecution demanded a fine of 12 000 Euro. It was argued that the “accommodation policy” favoured by the defendant was an incentive to irregular migration. The Court of First Instance of Saint Étienne acquitted the defendant. For further details see “History of Proceedings” and “Commentary”. Note: The case against the defendant was not pursued on grounds of migrant smuggling.

"Date(s) of offending: On/from throughout 2011 to 22 November 2011In February 2011, the German police informed OCRIEST (Office central pour la répression de l'immigration irrégulière et de l'emploi d' étrangers sans titre) of the existence of a Vietnamese organized criminal group primordially based and managed in France dedicated to the smuggling of migrants. The defendants were accused of membership in the said organized criminal group, the function of which was to ensure the illegal entry of migrants into the United Kingdom, either via transportation arranged by the criminal network or through the so-called “éco”, “Co”, or“Herbe” method, that is, hiding in lorries without the knowledge of the drivers.Specifically, throughout 2011 and until 22 November of the same year, the defendants operated in the regions of Île de France (France) and Nord Pas de Calais (France). They inter alia (i) procured the entry of migrants in France by purchasing bus, plane and train tickets, fraudulently obtaining visas, arranging for vehicles with drivers; (ii) provided accommodation and food to irregular migrants while awaiting for departure to the United Kingdom; (iii) transported migrants throughout the country as necessary; (iv) helped migrants jumping into lorries heading to the United Kingdom; (v) acted as passeurs.The organized criminal group facilitated irregular migration mostly of Chinese and Vietnamese individuals. As noted earlier, the main goal was to ensure their illegal entry into the United Kingdom. The smuggling venture often implicated passing through Romania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, and or Belgium before reaching France. Migrants left Vietnam by plane and entered Europe mostly via Czech Republic. They followed to France by train (300 Euro) or bus (100 Euro). Once in France, the migrants were received by members of the organized criminal group that arranged for their stay until the moment of departure. In respect of departures via “Co” method, it usually occurred via Calais. Migrants were kept in camps, monitored by smugglers. Conditions in such sites were difficult. Smugglers took from migrants their documentation and mobile phones.Specifically concerning the procurement of documents necessary to enter the European Union, the criminal group used valid documents of Vietnamese with physical resemblance to the migrants in question. To such documents were added visas fraudulently obtained through fictitious invitation letters issued by companies in Eastern Europe (mostly Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania). These visas “cost” 11000 Euro. The organized criminal group sold them to migrants at 13000 Euro. Once in the European Union, irregular migrants were to get rid of their own identity documents and keep only the fraudulent ones. Following June 2011, this modus operandi faced obstacles since embassies in Europe became reluctant to easily issue visas to Chinese nationals.The overall prices of the smuggling venture varied: between 18500 Euro and 20000 Euro – Vietnam to United Kingdom; 14000 Euro – Vietnam to France; between 13000 Euro and 15000 Euro – Vietnam to Czech Republic; 7000 – Czech Republic to France. Sometimes the payment was required before beginning the travel. Other times, migrants were allowed to pay part of the price once in Europe. On occasion, the payment of a deposit was demanded. As for the transfer of funds, migrants usually delivered the payment to small businesses in Vietnam (usually jewelry shops), which wired the money to assigned contacts in Europe.Defendant 9 was deemed the leader of the organized criminal group. Defendants 2 and 4 were his men of trust. The other defendants were intermediaries and middle-men, the functions of whom varied between recruiting irregular migrants in Vietnam, arranging for fraudulent documentation, accommodating migrants, collecting travel “prices”, transporting migrants, etc.Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 did not possess valid documents to enter and stay in France. They were thus accused of illegal entry and stay.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, especially from the irregular migrants and defendants. An interpreter appointed by the court assisted several of them. The defendants essentially denied the accusations held against them or recognized some minor participation therein. This notwithstanding, electronic and physical surveillance as well as searches were crucial in confirming the facts as exposed above.Legal findingsAll defendants were convicted of migrants smuggling in the context of an organised criminal group. Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 were acquitted of illegal entry and stay in national territory. For further details see  “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence

"The plaintiff, a woman of unknown age, established that she had been recruited and subjected to accommodation and work conditions contrary to human dignity by the two Respondents, a married couple for whom she worked, for their material benefit. The Plaintiff states that the Second Respondent had approached her with the promise that, if she came to work in France with the brother of the Second Respondent, she would receive a salary and would be able to follow literacy courses. The plaintiff was thus subjected to accommodation and working conditions which were contrary to her human dignity, as well as forced domestic servitude at the hands of – and for the benefit of - Respondents 1 and 2 over the period of October 2005 to November 2007. As found by the Court of Appeal of Versailles, Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code criminalising the trafficking in persons was modified by the Law 2007/1631 of November 20, 2007, changing the text of the Article from:         ‘Trafficking in persons is comprised of the recruitment, transportation, harbouring and reception of any person, for financial or other material benefit, to make said personavailable to a third party, even where said third party is not identified, in order to allow the commission of breaches of working or accommodation conditions against the person contrary to their human dignity.’To        ‘Trafficking in persons is the recruitment, transportation, harbouring or welcoming a person, for financial or other non-financial material benefit, in order to make them available to themselves or at the disposal of a third party, being identified or not, to enable to commission against the person of offences against the person resulting from their being subjected to working or accommodation conditions which are contrary to their human dignity.’ As such in the present case, from the period of the October 2005 to September 2008, the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in degrading conditions by the Respondents for their own benefit. Thus, as the Plaintiff had not been put at the disposal of a third party, from the period from October 2005 to November 2007 the Respondents could not be charged with trafficking in persons pursuant to the unamended text of Article 225-4-1 of the Penal Code. Rather, the respondents are liable for having committed the lesser offence of subjecting a person to accommodation and work conditions contrary to their human dignity pursuant to Article 225-14 of the Penal Code. The Court of Cassation, held however, that on the facts the respondent had been put at the disposal of a third party. This notwithstanding, from 20 November, 2007 to 21 September, 2008, the Respondents could be prosecuted for having committed trafficking in persons for the period over which the Plaintiff was harboured and forced to work in conditions contrary to their human dignity for the benefit of the Respondents following the entry into force of the Law 2007/1631 of the 20 November 2007.",drug offences,Not Sentence

They inter alia (i) procured the entry of migrants in France by purchasing bus, plane and train tickets, fraudulently obtaining visas, arranging for vehicles with drivers; (ii) provided accommodation and food to irregular migrants while awaiting for departure to the United Kingdom; (iii) transported migrants throughout the country as necessary; (iv) helped migrants jumping into lorries heading to the United Kingdom; (v) acted as passeurs.The organized criminal group facilitated irregular migration mostly of Chinese and Vietnamese individuals. As noted earlier, the main goal was to ensure their illegal entry into the United Kingdom. The smuggling venture often implicated passing through Romania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, and or Belgium before reaching France. Migrants left Vietnam by plane and entered Europe mostly via Czech Republic. They followed to France by train (300 Euro) or bus (100 Euro). Once in France, the migrants were received by members of the organized criminal group that arranged for their stay until the moment of departure. In respect of departures via “Co” method, it usually occurred via Calais. Migrants were kept in camps, monitored by smugglers. Conditions in such sites were difficult. Smugglers took from migrants their documentation and mobile phones.Specifically concerning the procurement of documents necessary to enter the European Union, the criminal group used valid documents of Vietnamese with physical resemblance to the migrants in question. To such documents were added visas fraudulently obtained through fictitious invitation letters issued by companies in Eastern Europe (mostly Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania). These visas “cost” 11000 Euro. The organized criminal group sold them to migrants at 13000 Euro. Once in the European Union, irregular migrants were to get rid of their own identity documents and keep only the fraudulent ones. Following June 2011, this modus operandi faced obstacles since embassies in Europe became reluctant to easily issue visas to Chinese nationals.The overall prices of the smuggling venture varied: between 18500 Euro and 20000 Euro – Vietnam to United Kingdom; 14000 Euro – Vietnam to France; between 13000 Euro and 15000 Euro – Vietnam to Czech Republic; 7000 – Czech Republic to France. Sometimes the payment was required before beginning the travel. Other times, migrants were allowed to pay part of the price once in Europe. On occasion, the payment of a deposit was demanded. As for the transfer of funds, migrants usually delivered the payment to small businesses in Vietnam (usually jewelry shops), which wired the money to assigned contacts in Europe.Defendant 9 was deemed the leader of the organized criminal group. Defendants 2 and 4 were his men of trust. The other defendants were intermediaries and middle-men, the functions of whom varied between recruiting irregular migrants in Vietnam, arranging for fraudulent documentation, accommodating migrants, collecting travel “prices”, transporting migrants, etc.Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 did not possess valid documents to enter and stay in France. They were thus accused of illegal entry and stay.In ascertaining the facts, authorities relied much on testimonial evidence, especially from the irregular migrants and defendants. An interpreter appointed by the court assisted several of them. The defendants essentially denied the accusations held against them or recognized some minor participation therein. This notwithstanding, electronic and physical surveillance as well as searches were crucial in confirming the facts as exposed above.Legal findingsAll defendants were convicted of migrants smuggling in the context of an organised criminal group. Defendants 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 10 were acquitted of illegal entry and stay in national territory. For further details see  “Procedural History” and “Commentary”.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence

"The defendant (Binh Thanh Le), a vendor on the darknet Wall Street Market (“Eastsidehigh”), and his two co-conspirators (Steven McCall and Allante Pires), were charged “with conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess with the intent to distribute” drugs, such as MDMA and ketamine, in violation of U.S. law. The defendant’s operations were revealed pursuant to U.S. postal service and other law enforcement investigations. The defendant received wholesale drugs and related raw materials, processed these drugs and/or manufactured drugs based on raw materials, and shipped them to buyers by postal service.  A search of the defendant’s home revealed packages with vacuum sealed bags containing drugs that had been purposely mislabeled (“Lego box for kids”). Border security agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection also intercepted packages from the defendant and co-conspirators, which contained illicit drugs. The defendant “pleaded guilty to conspiracy to manufacture, distribute and possess with intent to distribute” drugs and was required to forfeit over 59 bitcoin, USD 114,680, the proceeds from the sale of his vehicle, his currency counter, and pill press. For his crime, he received eight years’ imprisonment, followed by 3 years supervision upon release from prison.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"This case concerns the defendant Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, one of the leaders of a transnational network that facilitated computer intrusions, fraudulent schemes, and money laundering. The defendant was a Nigerian national and resident of the United Arab Emirates at the time of offending.From January 2019 to June 2020, the defendant conspired with multiple other persons to conduct financial transactions into, within, and outside the United States involving property that represented the proceeds of wire fraud. The co-conspirators targeted multiple victims and laundered and/or attempted to launder funds fraudulently obtained, as well as attempted to fraudulently obtain funds, through bank cyber-heists, business email compromise (“BEC”) frauds, and other fraud schemes. In December 2019, the defendant began conspiring with a co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator A”) to defraud a businessperson, who was seeking a lender to invest USD 15,000,000 in a project to build an international school. The defendant began communicating with the businessperson using an alias and promised to assist in opening a bank account in the United States, where the loan could be deposited. The defendant arranged for another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator B”) to open a bank account at Wells Fargo Bank in Canoga Park, California in the name of a Qatari company, and file a fictitious business name statement in order to register a fictitious business entity. Subsequently, the defendant directed a co-conspirator in Nigeria (“Co-conspirator C”) to create a false and fraudulent power of attorney bearing the name of the Qatari company.  The defendant then forwarded the bank information and power of attorney to the businessperson. The defendant and Co-Conspirator A each corresponded with the businessperson to fraudulently induce the businessperson to pay approximately USD 330,000 to fund the opening of a purported “investor’s account” in order to facilitate the transfer of the USD 15,000,000 loan they promised the businessperson. The defendant himself directed the businessperson to make wire transfers of USD 230,000 to the Wells Fargo bank account of a luxury watch-seller and USD 100,000 to a Capital One bank account of another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator D”), which the businessperson did.The defendant used these funds for his personal benefit, and none of the funds were used as promised to the businessperson. The defendant used the wire transfer of USD 230,000 to purchase a luxury Richard Mille RM11-03 watch and arranged for the watch-seller to have the watch available in the New York metropolitan area, where Co-conspirator D picked it up.  Co-conspirator D and another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator E”) arranged to have the watch delivered to a different co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator F”), who was directed by the defendant to transport the watch to the United Arab Emirates in January 2020.The defendant further directed Co-conspirator D to withdraw the USD 100,000 transferred to her and convert a portion of them - minus USD 8,000 as payment for Co-conspirator D – to the Nigerian currency, which she would then send to co-conspirators who would deliver the funds to the defendant using transfers between Nigerian bank accounts. The defendant also arranged to have Co-conspirator D send cashier’s checks of USD 40,000 and USD 10,000 to another co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator G”) who would use the funds to obtain St. Christopher (St. Kitts) and Nevis’ citizenship and a passport for the defendant, which he received in February 2020.In January and February 2020, the defendant and Co-conspirator A corresponded with the businessperson, attempting to fraudulently induce the businessperson to pay USD 575,000 in purported “taxes” to release the loan. In February, the businessperson wire transferred approximately USD 300,000 to bank accounts in Kenya.In the beginning of March 2020, the defendant further fraudulently induced the businessperson to send additional wire transfers to U.S. bank accounts, namely USD 100,000 to Co-conspirator D and USD 80,000 to a different co-conspirator (“Co-conspirator H”). The funds from these payments were subsequently laundered through a variety of means, with the assistance of Co-conspirators D, E, G, and H.The defendant later admitted to the following approximate actual or intended loss amounts, foreseeable to him, in connection with the victims identified:- Foreign Financial Institution: approximately USD 14,700,000.00; - Victim Companies in the U.K.: approximately USD 7,740,000.00;  - Victim Law Firm: USD 922,857.76;  - and Victim Businessperson and Qatari Victim Company: USD 809,983.58.The defendant was arrested by U.A.E. law enforcement officials in June 2020. After his expulsion from the U.A.E., FBI special agents obtained custody of Abbas and brought him to the United States to stand trial.In April 2021, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in money laundering. He was sentenced to over eleven years in prison and ordered to pay USD 1,732,841 in restitution to two fraud victims in November 2022.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"The defendant, Ruben Andre Garcia, engaged in coercion, force, and fraud to cause women to engage in commercial sex acts. Specifically, between 2013 and 2019, he recruited young women to participate in commercial sex act videos, which were later posted on pornography websites, GirlsDoPorn (GDP), GirlsDoToys (GDT), and PornHub, without the women’s consent. He duped the women by making false representations that the videos would not be posted online, made available in the U.S., or be seen by anyone the women knew.Several other co-conspirators (Michael James Pratt, Matthew Isaac Wolfe, Theodore Wilfred Gyi, Valorie Moser, and others) participated in the sex trafficking conspiracy. The defendant, and a co-conspirator (Pratt), also a recruiter, posted fake advertisements online on Craigslist (an online classified advertisement website) for modeling jobs. To convince the victims responding to the advertisements to participate in the filming of pornographic videos, the defendant, Pratt and other co-conspirators had other women, who were paid a fee for recruitment efforts and each time a victim agreed to be filmed, contact victims to assure them that the videos would not be made available online, in the U.S., or to anyone they know. Victims complained about painful sex acts requesting that filming stop, to no avail, and were frequently threatened with lawsuits and the posting of their videos online, the cancelation of tickets for their flights home, and the blocking of the victims’ exit from the hotel rooms with equipment where they were filming the videos to make the women feel that they could not leave.The defendant pleaded guilty to “conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion” and “sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion.” For his crimes, the defendant received 240 months’ imprisonment.Two of the defendant’s co-conspirators (Gyi and Moser) each pled guilty to “conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion”. Another co-conspirator (Amberlyn Dee Nored) had the charges against her dismissed, another is currently a fugitive (Pratt), and the other (Wolfe) is still awaiting trial.",drug offences,Not Sentence
"The defendant (Maksim Berezan), a Latvian national, was a member of an exclusive website (“DirectConnection”) for cybercriminals engaging in cyber-dependent and cyber-enabled crimes. To become of a member of the site, prospective users had to have three existing DirectConnection members vouch for them and had to provide information about their prior criminal history and reputation.  The existing DirectConnection members who would vouch for the prospective member would have to pay a fee as “insurance” to existing members in the event that the new member did not follow through with agreements with other members.   DirectConnection had forums with threads dedicated to specific issues of interest to members. The site also enabled users to send private messages through the site. Members also communicated off the site through Jabber and ICQ. DirectConnection had administrators, moderators, and arbiters to adjudicate disputes pursuant to the site’s dispute resolution mechanism. The defendant engaged in carding on DirectConnection, specializing in “cashouts” (i.e., the use of stolen card data and PINs to steal money from accounts or use the data to make fraudulent purchases) and “drops” (i.e., a who person receives, or forwards fraudulently obtained goods or money or a location where fraudulently obtained goods or money is dropped off). Electronic evidence in this case revealed that the defendant engaged in ransomware activities as well.The defendant was arrested in Latvia and extradited from Latvia to the United States of America to be prosecuted for his cybercrimes. The defendant pleaded guilty to “conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349” and “conspiracy to commit access device fraud and computer intrusions, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371”.

"Maksym Nienadov, a Ukrainian citizen, set up a company called Healthy Nation through which he manufactured and sold counterfeit medicine from at least July 2018 up to January 2019. As the business grew, he was joined by Volodymyr Nikolaienko.In June 2018, undercover U.S. authorities began communicating with Nienadov about the illegal sale of Keytruda on WhatsApp. A months-long exchange, which also involved Nikolaienko and resulted in the unlawful sale of counterfeit or unapproved Keytruda, Abraxane and Epclusa (Cancer and Hepatitis B drugs), followed. For the wire transfer, law enforcement received Nienadov’s banking information, which included the name “Maksim Nenadov” and his Ukrainian bank account number. After several transactions and the analysis of the counterfeit drugs by the registered trademark holders, undercover law enforcement invited the two defendants to Texas to discuss further business deals. Upon their arrival in Texas, US, the defendants were arrested and taken into custody on 18 April 2019.Neither Nienadov nor Nikolaienko were medical doctors, pharmacists or licensed pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States and they did not have authorisation to fabricate nor to sell the drugs.The defendants were charged with conspiracy, misbranded drugs, counterfeit drugs, trafficking in counterfeit drugs, and smuggling goods into the US.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"The leader (C.H.-M.) and two other high-ranking members (M.J.R. and S.A.S.) of a transnational criminal organization engaged in migrant smuggling operations in Tecate, Mexico. They were charged with various violations of Title 8, section 1324, of the United States Code, including alien smuggling, conspiracy to bring illegal aliens into the United States for financial gain, and conspiracy to transport undocumented aliens within the United States for financial gain. The organization had illegally smuggled migrants from Mexico through the southern border of California for a fee of US$ 8,000 per person. M.J.R. and S.A.S had arranged meetings at hotels and motels to obtain the fees. Arrangements had subsequently been made to send the fees to C.H.-M. in Mexico.ICT played an integral role in the logistics of the migrant smuggling operations. In particular, the leader, higher-ranking members and associates of the criminal organization used a well-known messaging application to communicate and coordinate with each other before and during smuggling operations. M.J.R. and other criminal associates were responsible for recruiting drivers for the smuggling operations. Drivers were recruited through employment advertisements on an online classified advertisement site and other websites. Among those recruited were secondary school students from San Diego, California. C.H.-M. also used ICT to monitor and track movements of operatives and migrants, as well as to inform drivers of the pick-up locations for migrants by using a well-known mapping and navigation application for mobile devices.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"This case regards the defendant’s involvement in a computer-based intrusion fraud scheme. A chief financial officer of one company, namely Unatrac Holding Limited, received an email that purportedly contained a web link to the Microsoft Office 365 login page. The victim, having an email account with this host, trusted the link and viewed it as legitimate. After clicking on the link he received in the phishing email, the page he was sent to resembled the Microsoft Office 365 login page. For this reason, the chief financial officer input his login credentials, which unbeknownst to him, were captured by criminals, including the defendant, who then used this information to access his account. His email account was then used to send fraudulent emails requesting wire transfers from other members of the company’s financial team. What is more, having observed company policy and the internal practice of forwarding emails from vendors, the perpetrator forwarded a fictitious email he had created to make it look as if a vendor was sending an invoice. Ultimately, this fraudulent scheme resulted in approximately USD 11,000,000 of wire transfers sent to the defendant and his co-conspirators.On 2 August 2019, a criminal complaint was filed against the defendant accusing him of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

"Aaron Michael Shamo ran a drug trafficking organization, of which the other five defendants were members, that imported controlled substances, such as fentanyl and alprazolam, from China and used the narcotics to produce fake oxycodone pills made with fentanyl and counterfeit Xanax tablets, which were subsequently sold on the Darknet marketplace AlphaBay using the vendor name “PHARMA-MASTER”. Shamo, through his organization, sold 1 million fentanyl-laced fake oxycodone pills to buyers in the United States, who were not aware of the falsification. Ultimately, Shamo was charged and convicted for running, organizing, supervising, and directing a continuing criminal enterprise that imported and distributed controlled substances.

"This case involves a member of the cyber organized criminal group “The Dark Overlord” (TDO), an organization that was known for their ransom and extortion scams. Beginning in 2016, the defendant was involved in a conspiracy that encompassed hacking several organizations in health, entertainment, finance, commercial, real estate, and transportation, stealing personal information from the systems they hacked, including for instance medical records, and then seeking ransom from the targets. Companies would usually have to pay a ransom of between USED 75,000 and 350,000 in bitcoin. The defendant’s role in the conspiracy was creating, validating, and maintaining communication, payment, and virtual private network accounts that were, inter alia, used to send threatening and extortionate messages to the victimized companies within the Eastern District of Missouri, where the defendant was ultimately tried.The defendant was indicted by a federal grand jury for conspiracy, two counts of aggravated theft, and three counts of threatening to damage a protected computer on 8 November 2017.

"This case involved Bryan Connor Herrell, an “employee” of the dark net site “AlphaBay” who was involved in moderating thousands of illegal transactions under various monikers, including “Penissmith” and “Botah.” From 2016 through July 2017 AlphaBay was the world’s largest online black market, and shortly before its shut down in 2017 it hosted approximately 368,810 listings for the sale of various illicit goods, approximately 350,000 active buyer accounts, and over 9,000 active vendor accounts.AlphaBay was created by Alexandre Cazes, who was prosecuted separately before committing suicide while in custody, in or around July 2014. The marketplace was designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. Numerous vendors used AlphaBay to distribute controlled substances and illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars gained from these illegal transactions. At the time of writing, the site is known to have facilitated the distribution in excess of 90kg of heroin, 450kg of cocaine, and 45kg of methamphetamine.The only way to access AlphaBay was through The Onion Router (“Tor”) network. This network anonymized the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of its underlying servers and allowed vendors and buyers to hide their true identities. Additional measures were also taken to keep identities hidden as AlphaBay required its users to transact in digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum, and did not allow for transactions in official, government-backed currencies. By only accepting digital currencies, AlphaBay and its users were able to bypass the traditional financial systems. AlphaBay was set up like a conventional e-commerce website as a search tool allowed users to choose the type of illegal goods or services they wished to purchase, and users were able to sign up for free by choosing a screen name and password for their account. Furthermore, users could also search by price ranges, popularity of items, vendors, origin or shipping country, and payment types.The defendant Herrell and other co-conspirators (both known and unknown to the Grand Jury) were members and associates of AlphaBay. The marketplace operated as criminal enterprise with “employees” serving as security administrators, moderators, public relations specialists, and scam watchers (whose primary duty is to identify and remove fraudulent listings), meaning that leaders, members, and associates of AlphaBay had defined roles in the organization. The defendant in this case held the position of moderator from about May 2016 through July 2017. As moderator, Herrell had access to portions of the AlphaBay platform that were not available to the general public and had the authority to refund payments from buyers on the website, restore a user’s access to the site, engage in staff-only discussions and meetings, and view the amount of digital currency available to other members of the AlphaBay organization. Moderators also held the responsibility of moderating disputes between buyers and vendors on AlphaBay. For his work as a moderator, Herrell was paid four bitcoins per week (bitcoin was worth about USD 2,000 per coin in May 2016, and about USD 2,600 in July 2017). Through moderating disputes, the defendant Herrell had full visibility and awareness of the criminal activities occurring on AlphaBay and therefore held a role in directly facilitating these criminal activities. In addition, Herrell also held the position of scam watcher from around August 2015 to December 2015, where he monitored and quashed phishing attempts and other scams being carried out on AlphaBay. Herrell was also paid in bitcoin for this work.In 2017, Bryan Connor Herrell was indicted on the felony crime of Conspiracy to Engage in Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, USD 250,000 criminal fine, and up to 3 years supervised release. Additionally, upon conviction of this offence, Herrell also was subject to a forfeiture of property pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1963(a)(1) - (a)(3). Herrell entered into a plea agreement and was sentenced to 11 years in prison in September 2020. The following assets were forfeited: one cryptocurrency wallet containing approximately one Bitcoin, an assortment of counterfeit “Magic: The Gathering” and sports collectible cards, approximately USD 745.00 in U.S. currency, 139 gold coins (one ounce each), 8 silver dollar coins (one ounce each), one USD 1,000 bill encased in hard plastic, and one German August Schwer Cuckoo clock.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"This case involves the sentencing of a Russian national who operated two websites facilitating payment card fraud, computer hacking, and other crimes.According to the official documents, the defendant, Aleksei Burkov, operated a website called “Card Planet,” which offered stolen credit card data that had been obtained mostly through computer intrusion. There were hundreds of thousands of victims, many of them U.S. citizens. Over 150,000 stolen credit card numbers from over 1,300 banks were offered for purchase. Regarding cards of U.S. accounts alone, this resulted in over USD 20 million in fraudulent purchases.In addition, the defendant operated another website, which was invite-only, where elite cybercriminals could advertise stolen goods (i.e. personal identification data), malicious software, and criminal services, including money laundering and hacking services. To obtain membership, prospective members needed three existing members to “vouch” for them and pay a sum of money, usually USD 5,000, as insurance. These measures were aimed at avoid detection from law enforcement authorities as well as guaranteeing that their members valued the deals made on the website. To the same end, the forum removed arrested members from the site by banning them to prevent law enforcement agencies from using the arrested member and/or arrested member’s details to access the site.The defendant was arrested at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel, in December 2015. On 4 February 2016, the defendant was charged with conspiring to commit access device fraud (included in two counts), identity theft, computer intrusion, wire fraud (included in two counts), and money laundering, as well as with access device fraud and wire fraud in a superseding indictment. In 2017, an Israeli district court approved the extradition of the defendant to the United States. After the denial of the defendant’s appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli High Court of Justice, the defendant was finally extradited on 11 November 2019. On 23 January 2020, The defendant pleaded guilty to one count of access device fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, identity theft, computer intrusions, wire fraud, and money laundering on 23 January 2020.

"This case involves several offences, including conspiracy, smuggling cultural property into the U.S., obstruction of justice, and citizenship and naturalization fraud, committed by the defendant Ijaz Khan with the assistance of several co-conspirators. In 2002, the co-conspirator Vera Lautt travelled to Pakistan to meet Ijaz Khan, whom she had met online, and to sign marriage documents. Subsequently, they both submitted fraudulent documents to the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), facilitating the immigration and later naturalization of Ijaz Khan. The defendant Ijaz Khan was, however, still married to a Pakistani woman, with whom he had and continued to have children, at the time of and after signing the marriage documents. According to the indictment, Ijaz Khan used his citizenship to enable the immigration and later naturalization of his four oldest sons. He divorced Lautt before the children had arrived in the United States. He further filed or assisted with petitions on behalf of his brother, Ibar Khan, his Pakistani wife, his mother, and another two children.Following his immigration from approximately 2007 until May 2014, Ijaz and Fahad Khan, together with others, conspired to smuggle cultural artifacts (e.g., coins, pottery, arrowheads and bronze weapons) that were stolen from burial sites from Pakistan into the United States. The defendant used his company, Indus Valley, to sell the stolen cultural artifacts to his existing customer base, in person at shows, and online (on websites and auction sites, like eBay).In October 2013, a shipment was inspected and seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Subsequently, Ijaz and Fahad Khan, together with their co-conspirator John Bryan McNamara, conspired to submit fraudulent documents purporting to be from the Pakistan government authorizing his export of the cultural artifacts and certifying the value of objects. McNamara had previously pleaded guilty to smuggling the artifacts into the U.S. and making false statements to special agents when interrogated about this shipment.The defendant was identified as the leader and organizer of an organized criminal group made up of family members (e.g., wife and sons) and others who were not related to the defendant (e.g., McNamara). He played a central role in planning and operations, recruitment of accomplices, and controlled and exercised authority over others in the group. Because of his central leadership role, he received a sentencing enhancement, which he unsuccessfully appealed. The defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment, a fine of approximately USD 115,000, and was required to forfeit more than 1,300 cultural artifacts. The defendant unsuccessfully appealed his conviction and sentence to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.Others in the organized criminal group pleaded guilty and were also sentenced for their roles in the conspiracy to commit smuggling, including Vera Lautt and John Bryan McNamara, who received four months’ imprisonment (and two years’ supervised release from prison) and two years of probation, respectively.",drug offences,Sentenced
"A group of five defendants participated in a worldwide ponzi scheme, the BitClub Network, which defrauded cryptocurrency investors. The BitClub Network required membership fees, “solicited money from investors in exchange for shares of pooled investments in cryptocurrency mining,” and “rewarded existing investors for recruiting new investors.” The funds provided by investors were purportedly required to sustain the cryptocurrency mining pools by, for example, purchasing equipment and computing power. The profits made by investors supposedly depended on the success of the mining pool operations and the number of shares investors had in the mining pools. To lure investors, keep existing investors, and get investors to provide money, the defendants fraudulently represented earnings. The group fraudulently “obtained at least [USD]… 722 million from investors.” The BCN shares sold were not registered as “securities” with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as required by law. Two of the five defendants pled guilty: Joseph Frank Abel pled guilty to “conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities” and Silviu Catalin Balaci to “conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to offer and sell unregistered securities.” At the time of writing, the remaining three defendants (Matthew Brent Goettsche, Russ Albert Medlin, Jobadiah Sinclair Weeks) have not yet been tried.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"The organized criminal group involved in this case perpetrated several cybercrimes, one of which was online auction fraud. According to the indictment, this fraud was perpetrated by members of the group by posting “hundreds or thousands of listings for automobiles, motorcycles, and other high-priced goods on eBay and similar auction sites.” The images of the items being sold that were included in these postings were infected with malware (i.e., the Bayrob Trojan). When individuals clicked on the images of the items, their devices were infected with the malware, which was designed to redirect these individuals to webpages that looked identical to the legitimate websites of the auction sites. For example, their fake eBay pages included the trademark of the organization and had a similar layout, design, and style of the legitimate eBay webpages with an important key difference. The fake eBay webpages prompted users to pay for the auctioned items using something called an “eBay escrow agent,” which does not exist on the legitimate platform. This purported service claimed to hold the money of the buyer in escrow until the item was received and the buyer was satisfied with the condition of the item delivered before the buyer’s funds were released to the seller. The webpages also included a live chat function that supposedly enabled individuals to speak with customer service agents of eBay; of course, these were not real eBay customer service agents, they were members of the group. The victims of this online auction fraud never received the items they paid for and never received a refund for the money they paid for the non-delivered items.One of the defendants (T.D.) pled guilty to aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy offences relating to wire fraud and money laundering, and received 10 years imprisonment for his crimes. B.N. and R.M. were charged, convicted, and sentenced to 20 and 18 years’ imprisonment, respectively, for aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy offences relating to wire fraud and money laundering, as well as conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit service marks.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator Brandon Arias used the moniker “The Drug Llama” on a vendor account on Dream Market (a Darknet site) to sell counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl. Melissa Scanlan was responsible for sourcing the drugs that would be sold using via the vendor account, while Brandon Arias was responsible for receiving and fulfilling Darknet drug orders, as well as the management of the account. Melissa Scanlan and her co-conspirator received fentanyl and other narcotics from Mexico, predominantly from Fausto Ramirez and another (unnamed) member of the Mexican cartel. After Melissa Scanlan and Brandon Arias sold the drugs, they kept a portion of the proceeds and gave the remaining criminal proceeds to couriers (usually Norma Dominguez and April Kelly, both females). The couriers would transport the proceeds across U.S.-Mexican border and deliver them to Fausto Ramirez and another member of a Mexican cartel. In one year alone, an estimated 52,000 counterfeit pills containing fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl pills were sold.Melissa Scanlan was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, misbranding of drugs, international money laundering conspiracy, and distribution of fentanyl resulting in death. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 13 years and 4 months’ imprisonment.Brandon Arias was charged with and convicted for conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, distribution of fentanyl, sale of counterfeit drugs, and misbranding of drugs.

"This case involves Gary Davis, a member of the small administrative “staff” of the Darknet marketplace “Silk Road.” During its operation from 2011 until 2013, Silk Road was used to distribute illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services to more than 100,000 buyers, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of proceeds of these illicit transactions.From June to 2 October 2013, Davis, also known under his alias “Libertas,” worked as a site administrator on Silk Road. He was responsible for responding to customer support requests regarding the need for assistance with buyer or seller accounts, serving as an arbitrator by resolving disputes between drug dealers and their customers, and enforcing the rules for doing business on Silk Road, such as the rule against out of escrow sales. Davis was paid a weekly salary for his administrative services on the marketplace.Shortly after law enforcement authorities had shut down Silk Road in October 2013, its virtually identical successor, Silk Road 2.0, emerged. Davis also served as an administrator for the successor website from November to December 2013.The defendant, along with two of his co-conspirators, was charged with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy on 19 December 2013. Davis was arrested in Ireland in January 2014 and extradited to the United States in July 2018. Davis pleaded guilty to narcotics trafficking conspiracy on 5 October 2018 and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release on 25 July 2019. He was further ordered to forfeit USD 25,000. At the time of writing, no official information is available on the convictions of his co-defendants, Andrew Michael Jones and Peter Phillip Nash.",drug offences,Sentenced
"The defendant, Mr Gary Davis (aka “Libertas”) worked for the Silk Road website from June 2013 until 2 October 2013 (when the website was shutdown).Silk Road was an online black market created by Mr Ross Ulbricht where a wide range of illegal goods and services could be bought and sold. The platform resembled other online market places in that it required a username and password to log in, offered users a “shopping cart”, and had other like features). A variety of illicit drugs such as cannabis, ecstasy, and opioids were available for purchase on the website. The drugs purchased on Silk Road caused real harm—drugs purchased on Silk Road resulted in six deaths for overdose (though there is no suggestion that Mr Davis was responsible for any of these deaths). Counterfeit and fraudulent identity documents were also available for sale on the website—including, for instance, counterfeit US and foreign passports, US and foreign drivers’ licenses, and social security cards. Computer hacking tools and services were also available for purchase on Silk Road, including password hacking tools and services, Remote Access Tools (RAT) which allows users to obtain unauthorised remote access to a compromised computer, keyloggers which permit a user to monitor keystrokes inputted by a victim into his or her computer and used to steal confidential information, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) services which disable websites or other publicly available services on the Internet by using large networks of compromised computers to flood victim systems with malicious internet traffic. Finally, Silk Road offered money laundering services to its users, many of which were directly marketed to vendors who sold goods or services on the website. Money laundering services aimed at converting proceeds of illegal transactions (obtained in Bitcoin, the required means of payment on the Silk Road website) into other forms of currency. Vendors in this category offered, among other things, the sale of US currency, anonymous debit cards preloaded with currency and other prepaid payment systems, such as Moneypak cards.Silk Road was only accessible through the Tor network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed round the work and designed to conceal the true IP of the computers on the network and, thereby, the identities of users.The required and only payment system on Silk Road was Bitcoin—an entirely electronic currency, not issued by any bank or state, generated and controlled automatically through computer software operating on a peer-to-peer network, and operated through blockchain stored on the peer-to-peer network. On Silk Road, every user had one (or more) Silk Road Bitcoin address associated with their own Silk Road account. The Bitcoin address could be used by each user to deposit funds into their Silk Road account. These addresses were stored on “wallet” files maintained on computer servers controlled by Mr Ulbricht. To make purchases on the website, therefore, a user had to first obtain Bitcoin (for example, from a Bitcoin exchanger) and send these to a Bitcoin address associated with the user’s Silk Road account. Once the purchase took place, the funds were debited from the user’s Silk Road account and held in escrow in a wallet file maintained by Silk Road pending completion of the transaction. Once the transaction was completed the vendor’s Silk Road account would be credited with the payment minus the commission Silk Road took on the sale (8–15% of the transaction). The vendor would then withdraw the Bitcoins from his Silk Road account by transferring them to an outside Bitcoin address, such as the address of a Bitcoin exchanger who would cash out the Bitcoins for real currency. The vendors would also convert their Bitcoins into other currencies, by using money laundering services offered on the website.Silk Road would also use a so-called “tumbler” to hinder the tracking of individual transactions through the blockchain. In a nutshell, the “tumbler” would obscure any link between both the buyer’s and the vendor’s Bitcoin addresses. It would, therefore, make the use of blockchain to follow the money trail useless, even if both the vendor’s and buyer’s Bitcoin addresses were known.Mr Ulbricht ran the website with some support staff (they were four when Silk Road was shutdown by law enforcement on 2 October 2013), who were divided into forum moderators and site administrators. Forum moderators were responsible for, among other things, monitoring user activity on discussion forums associated with the site, providing guidance to forum users concerning how to conduct business on Silk Road, and reporting any significant problems discussed on the forums to the site administrators and Mr Ulbricht. Site administrators were in charge of responding to customer support requests from Silk Road users who needed assistance with their buyer or seller accounts; investigating disputes that arose between vendors and buyers, including reporting their findings to Mr Andrew Michael Jones (another site administrator) or Mr Ulbricht; and helping enforce the rules for doing business on Silk Road. This last responsibility included demoting vendors or referring them to Mr Ulbricht for further discipline. This could happen when vendors and buyers would communicate on Silk Road and decide to conclude the sale offsite to avoid paying to Silk Road a commission (this was called “out of escrow” sales).Mr Gary Davis first worked for a month as a forum moderator of Silk Road. He then was “promoted” to site administrator. As a site administrator, he demoted an account that was likely compromised by the police and posted some posts on the forum advising users how to conceal their true identities. When Silk Road was shut down by law enforcement on 2 October 2013, Mr Davis helped with the launch of “Silk Road 2.0”, a website which was created in the month following Silk Road’s demise. Mr Davis used his credibility with the original Silk Road community to vouch for the new website. He worked on the new version of Silk Road as a site administrator for one month, until he was arrested in Ireland in January 2014.Mr Davis was extradited from Ireland to the US in July 2018. He pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to traffic a controlled substance (narcotics). He was sentenced to six years and six months’ imprisonment on 25 July 2019.",drug offences,Sentenced
"Between 2015 and 2017, the defendant Sergiy Petrovich Usatyuk and a co-conspirator deployed booter services for financial gain, allowing paying users to utilize their services to launch DDoS attacks. Specifically, the defendant and the co-conspirator developed software and created, controlled, and operated a website and infrastructure (e.g., domain names and servers in the U.S. and Romania) to enable paying users to deploy DDoS attacks. One of the most popular booter services used included ExoStresser. Other services offered included Betabooter, Databooter, DecafeStresser, Instabooter, IP Booters, IP Stressors, Polystress, QuezStresser, and Zstress. The booter services the defendant provided along with his co-conspirator were used to conduct 1,367,610 DDoS attacks against systems inside and outside of the United States. These DDoS attacks not only caused harm to the computer systems directly targeted, but also caused harm to computers systems not directly targeted by the attacks. The defendant and the co-conspirator also created and maintained the payment and cryptocurrency accounts needed to obtain the proceeds of crime. The defendant and co-conspirators further engaged in tactics to conceal their identities and activities. In 2019, the defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to cause damage to protected computers. That same year, the defendant was sentenced to 13 months’ imprisonment and three years of supervised release following the completion of the sentence. He was required to forfeit USD 542,925.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"This case involved a sextortion scheme perpetrated by inmates in the South Carolina Department of Corrections, as well as co-conspirators outside of the prison, against U.S. military personnel. In this sextortion scheme, the inmates, using smartphones they smuggled into the prison, signed up for dating apps and targeted U.S. military members utilizing these apps. The defendants and co-conspirators created fake profiles of women using images that they found online. After contacting the targets and obtaining personal information from them, the inmates would send naked images of the person they were impersonating (images which were also found online) and request that the targets provide nude images. The inmates would then call the targets impersonating the father of the person the targets were in contact with (i.e., the women in the profile). The inmates would proceed to misinform the targets that they were communicating with a minor and that what the targets had in their possession (i.e., the naked image) was considered child sexual abuse material. The inmates would then threaten to contact the authorities and report the individuals if money was not paid to the “victim”. The targets were directed to pay these fees using wire transfers via Western Union, MoneyGram, Walmart, and PayPal. The inmates recruited money mules, who received the wire transfers from the military members and would then send the funds to the inmates as directed.The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, extortion, and money laundering. Several of the defendants pled guilty. Specifically, Tiffany Reed pled guilty and was sentenced to three years’ probation for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Another defendant, Wendell Wilkins, also pled guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, but has yet to be sentenced. Jalisa Thompson, Brandon Thompson pled guilty to money laundering and were sentenced to time served and 15 months’ imprisonment, respectively. The prosecution also submitted a motion to dismiss the indictment against one of the defendants, namely, Laben McCoy.

"This case involved Ronald L. Wheeler, an “employee” of the dark net site “AlphaBay” who was involved in, inter alia, moderating the AlphaBay subreddit, moderating the AlphaBay message board forums, and mediating sales disputes, under the monikers “Trappy” and “Trappy_Pandora.” From 2016 through July 2017, AlphaBay was the world’s largest online black market, and shortly before its shut down in 2017, hosted approximately 368,810 listings for the sale of various illicit goods, approximately 350,000 active buyer accounts, and over 9,000 active vendor accounts.AlphaBay was created by Alexandre Cazes, who was prosecuted separately before committing suicide while in custody, in or around July 2014. The marketplace was designed to enable users to buy and sell illegal goods, including controlled substances, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals. Numerous vendors used AlphaBay to distribute controlled substances and illegal goods and services to buyers throughout the world and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars gained from these illegal transactions. At the time of writing, the site is known to have facilitated the distribution in excess of 90kg of heroin, 450kg of cocaine, and 45kg of methamphetamine.The only way to access AlphaBay was through The Onion Router (“Tor”) network. This network anonymized the Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses of its underlying servers and allowed vendors and buyers to hide their true identities. Additional measures were also taken to keep identities hidden as AlphaBay required its users to transact in digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Monero, and Ethereum, and did not allow for transactions in official, government-backed currencies. By only accepting digital currencies, AlphaBay and its users were able to bypass the traditional financial systems. AlphaBay was set up like a conventional e-commerce website, as a search tool allowed users to choose the type of illegal goods or services they wished to purchase, and users were able to sign up for free by choosing a screen name and password for their account. Furthermore, users could also search by price ranges, popularity of items, vendors, origin or shipping country, and payment types.On 25 May 2015 at the latest, the defendant began working for AlphaBay as a public relations specialist. His duties included moderating the AlphaBay subreddit on the website reddit.com, moderating the AlphaBay message board forums, mediating sales disputes among AlphaBay users, promoting AlphaBay online, and providing non-technical assistance to AlphaBay users. The defendant was paid in Bitcoin for his services. His work continued until the website was shut down.The defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit acces device fraud. He pleaded guilty in March 2018 and was sentenced to three years, 10 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release on 31 July 2018.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"This case involves a transnational criminal organization (called the “Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network” by U.S. authorities in the criminal indictment) which perpetrated online auction fraud (i.e., advertising and selling non-existent items) against U.S. victims on eBay, Craigslist, Amazon, and AutoTrader.com. The organization primarily operated in Alexandria, Romania, with some operations taking place in other areas of Eastern Europe, as well as the United States. The victims of the online auction fraud paid for the fake items with “reloadable prepaid cards, prepaid debit cards, and gift cards of varying types (collectively referred to herein as ‘prepaid debit cards’), including Green Dot Moneypaks, Visa One Vanilla prepaid debit cards, PayPal My Cash cards, and Amazon gift cards; United States postal money orders; cashier’s checks; MoneyGram and Western Union wires; and bank wires and deposits.”The Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network worked with others to launder criminal proceeds, by taking the money paid by victims for the fake items sold online, converting the money to Bitcoin, transferring the Bitcoin to members and associates in Eastern Europe, and using Bitcoin exchanges to convert the Bitcoin to fiat currency. Associates of the organizations in the United States, such as J.A.V., obtained victim payments, converted them to Bitcoins, and sent the Bitcoins to members of the organization who had perpetrated the online auction fraud. Third-party money launderers in the U.S. (i.e., A.E.N., D.A.B., and R.W.D.L.T) were also used to collect, redeem, and convert victim payment into cash or Bitcoins. Additionally, two Bitcoin exchangers were used by the Alexandria Online Auction Fraud Network. Particularly, a Bulgarian national (Rossen Iossifov) owner of a Bitcoin exchange (RG Coins), registered in Bulgaria, was charged and convicted for conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit money laundering in contravention of U.S. laws. A Romanian national (Vlad-Calin Nistor) owner of a Bitcoin exchange (Coinflux Services SRL), registered in Romania, pled guilty to conspiracy to commit racketeering.In total, 20 individuals, 16 of which were foreign nationals, were charged in the United States, and 12 of the foreign nationals were extradited to the United States. At the time of writing, 17 individuals have been convicted for crimes relating to the online auction fraud perpetrated by members and associates of the criminal organization, including (but not limited to): conspiracy to commit racketeering, money laundering, and wire fraud, and well as identity-related fraud.",drug offences,Sentenced
"This case involves an international online child sexual exploitation ring, the Bored group, which met, organized its activities, and operated exclusively online. The Bored group earned this nickname because the chatrooms they created all included the word “bored” in them. Initially, the group met on Stickham, a social media platform which was popular for live streaming video chats. Frustrated with the moderation that existed on this site, they migrated to other sites and ultimately ended up using one unidentified site that was not moderated. The chatrooms they created on this site could not be found unless the person knew the URL of the chatroom.The perpetrators devised and executed a plan to lure targets from moderated platforms to an unmoderated chatroom-based forum and entice them to engage in sex acts. Specifically, the members of the group worked together to recruit, entice, and coerce minors to engage in sex acts during video-chat sessions. To accomplish this, members of the group created fake profiles of teenage boys on social media and dating sites, such as MYLOL.com, Periscope, YouNow, and Gifyo, to target minor girls. The members would then identify minors to target, contact, and communicate with in order to get the victims to join the offenders in unmonitored chatrooms. All of the members of the group spent a considerable amount of time communicating with their targets in order to gain their trust, build rapport with them, and ultimately, entice the victims to commit sex acts. Beyond communication, Bored group members used several techniques to manipulate victims, including:1. Dares. Daring minors to engage in sexualized behaviour and sex acts.2. Polls. Running polls with participants in the chat rooms about the attractiveness of minors and/or voting on what type of items of clothing the minor should remove and/or what type of sex act the minor should engage in.3. Competitions. Minors were pitted against each other in an effort to be rewarded (i.e., they would receive points for engaging in certain sexualized behaviour and sex acts, and advance levels based on points).4. Purporting to Block Cameras. To reduce the inhibitions of minors, members who victims trusted (called “handlers”) would claim that they could block the camera and prevent others in the chatroom from viewing the victims. When the handler told other group members that this tactic was used, the participants in the chatroom would pretend that they were unable to see the victim’s web camera.  5. Loops. Pre-recorded videos of minors talking and/or engaging in sexualized behaviour or sex acts.  These videos were played as if they were occurring in real-time in order to manipulate a minor into engaging in similar conduct and/or acts. The Bored group had distinct roles for members: hunters, talkers, and loopers. Hunters lured victims to the chatroom. Talkers handled the next phase, which involved convincing the minors to undress and masturbate on camera by engaging them in conversation and building trust and rapport. Loopers posed as a female minor and played a pre-recorded video of a previous victim talking or engaging in sex acts (but passed it off as if it was playing in real-time). Loopers played these pre-recorded videos in an effort to convince girls to perform a sex act.As a method to monitor, evaluate, and coordinate their activities, track progress, and share their knowledge and expertise, they would discuss their plans, activities, and experiences on a separate site (the now defunct Titan Pad) and record their activities and experiences on a password-protected spreadsheet on that site that included information about which chatrooms on the website were associated with which victims and the social media accounts associated with members that were used to lure each of the victims. The spreadsheet also enabled the members of the group to keep track of the manipulation techniques that were successful with each victim and what sex acts each victim engaged in (including extremely depraved acts; e.g., one member of the group enticed a minor to engage in a sex act with a dog). After Titan Pad ceased its operation in 2017, the Bored group moved its activities to Discord, a group chat platform, with voice and video capabilities.The defendant, Caleb Young, pled guilty to child exploitation enterprise and received 30 years’ imprisonment for his crime. Other members of the group were also charged and sentenced for their crimes. C.M., the leader of the child exploitation enterprise, received 40 years’ imprisonment for his crime. He was killed in prison during an altercation with other inmates in January 2019. Other members of the group received 38 years’ (A.S.), 37 years and 6 months’ (O.O.), 35 years’ (J.N.R.), 31 years and 3 months’ (M.F.), and 30 years and 6 months’ imprisonment (B.J.S. and D.W., each) for their crimes.

"This case involves the co-founders, administrators and members of the Infraud Organization, which was founded in 2010 and was active between 2010 and 2018. The slogan of the organization was “in fraud we trust.” The Infraud Organization operated as a criminal enterprise with its objective of financially enriching its members through cybercrimes, particularly online fraud and identity theft. The illicit acts the organization engaged in included money laundering, identity theft, counterfeit identification trafficking, bank fraud, wire fraud, among other crimes. In total, the organization caused USD 568 million in actual losses and USD 2.2 billion in intended losses. The Infraud Organization ran an online discussion forum, known as Infraud, which had over 10,000 members from around the world. According to the Second Superseding Criminal Indictment, the roles of individuals that were part of this criminal enterprise included administrators, super moderators, moderators, vendors, VIP members, and members:1. Administrators.  Administrators were responsible for “long-term strategic planning” of the enterprise, and daily management tasks, such as determining responsibilities and levels of access of all members, vetting prospective members, deciding which members can join, and rewarding and punishing existing members.2. Super Moderators. Super moderators were responsible for moderating content by reviewing contraband for sale, editing and deleting posts based on reviews, and mediating disputes between buyers and vendors (i.e., sellers). The content they moderated was assigned based on either geographic area or criminal expertise.3. Moderators. Moderators have some of the same responsibilities for moderating content, but they have less privileges and authority than super moderators. 4. Vendors. Individuals who sold and/or advertised illicit goods and services on the site.5. VIP members. VIP members were longstanding, distinguished members of the platform.6. Members.  General members of the forum.The founders of the organization are Svyatoslav Bondarenko and Sergey Medvedev. Along with being a co-founder, Sergey Medvedev served as the administrator of the site and ran the escrow service of the organization, which held funds for a purchase in escrow until the buyer received the items purchased (in good order). He further created a virtual currency exchange service where virtual currencies were exchanged for fiat currencies, promoted, created incentives, and set prices for advertisements on Infraud. The defendant assumed leadership of the organization after Svyatoslav Bondarenko disappeared.For quality control of contraband recovered from acts of fraud and identity theft, members provided feedback and ratings of vendors and their products. To protect individuals who are part of this criminal enterprise, measures were taken to secure the site and restrict access to the site. Svyatoslav Bondarenko established rules governing the conduct of members on Infraud and these rules were enforced by administrators, moderators, and supermoderators of the forum. Members who violated these rules were punished by, for example, being removed and banned from the site. All new members had to be vetted before being granted access to the forum.In this case, 36 defendants were charged for their roles in the Infraud Organization. The criminal proceedings for most of these defendants are still ongoing. The defendant, one of the founders of Infraud, Sergey Medvedev, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in a racketeer influenced corrupt organization. The other founder, Svyatoslav Bondarenko, is still at large. Two other defendants and members of Infraud pleaded guilty to engage in a racketeer influenced corrupt organization. Firstly, Jose Gamboa became a member of Infraud in December 2010 and advertised as vendor of custom-built ATM skimmers within the Infraud forum. Secondly, Valerian Chiochiu advised other members on the development and use of malware. He also developed malware that was used by other members to gain unauthorized access to personal and financial data and access device data. The illegally obtained information would then be sold on the Infraud forum to other Infraud members. The defendant also fraudulently purchased gift cards which were then sold on the Infraud forum to members for a profit.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence

"This case involves several cyber and organized crime related offences of the creator of Silk Road, a massive online marketplace which sold illicit goods and services, in particular drugs. The defendant, Ross William Ulbricht, created Silk Road in January 2011, and owned and operated the website until it was shut down by law enforcement authorities in October 2013.The defendant deliberately operated Silk Road as an online criminal marketplace with the intent to facilitate its users to buy and sell illegal goods and services anonymously and under the radar of law enforcement. The defendant aimed at anonymizing transactions on Silk Road by operating Silk Road on “The Onion Router,” or “Tor” network, a special network of computers on the Internet, distributed around the world, designed to conceal the true IP addresses, and hence identities of its users; and by including a Bitcoin-based payment system that concealed the identities and locations of the users.The defendant controlled and oversaw every aspect of Silk Road, and managed a staff of paid, online administrators and computer programmers who assisted with the day-to-day operation of the site.  The defendant reaped commissions worth over USD 13 million generated from the illicit sales conducted through the site.The U.S. government learned of Silk Road in 2011, after intercepting a drug package in Chicago's O'Hare airport, and commenced an investigation into the online marketplace. Agents discovered that the Silk Road was run and managed by someone with the screen name of “Dread Pirate Roberts” (D.P.R.). In 2012, law enforcement agents investigated several individuals believed to be “Dread Pirate Roberts,” including Ross Ulbricht, Anand Athavale, and Mark Karpeles. Ultimately, Ulbricht became the primary suspect in 2013 after a series of “pen/trap” orders, which led U.S. law enforcement agents to collect evidence in the form of I.P. address data from Ulbricht’s home wireless network. Additional evidence came from undercover investigations, in which law enforcement agents took over low-level Silk Road administrators’ accounts and interacted with D.P.R. online, in an attempt to expose Ulbricht. In October 2013, at the San Francisco public library, agents arrested Ulbricht after catching him while he was logged in as the administrator of Silk Road and its D.P.R.The defendant was charged with and convicted of distributing narcotics, distributing narcotics by means of the Internet, conspiring to distribute narcotics, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit computer hacking, conspiring to traffic in false identity documents, and conspiring to commit money laundering.

The site enabled users to chat, exchange, and purchase images of child sexual abuse content in an anonymous way.The site had more than 150,000 users from around the world and was believed by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to be the world’s largest child pornography website. The content of the website was divided into different ‘boards’ categorised according to the age and sex of the victims and the type of sexual activity involved.Following a slip up by Chase in December 2014, Playpen’s unique IP address was exposed to a foreign law enforcement agency. The IP address was revealed to be in the US, and the law enforcement agency notified the FBI.In January 2015 the FBI, in partnership with the US Department of Justice’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, launched ‘Operation Pacifier’, which sought to identify the members of the Playpen website and bring them to justice.On 19 February 2015, the FBI executed a search warrant of Mr Chase’s home and Mr Chase was arrested. Forensic examination of a computer and devices seized during the search found thousands of images of child exploitation material.On 16 September 2016, a federal jury found Mr Chase of multiple charges relating to child pornography and child exploitation. On 1 May 2017 he was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment for these offences.Two other men, Messrs Michael Fluckiger, 46, of Indiana, United States of America, and David Browning, 47, of Kentucky, United States of America, also acted as administrators of the Playpen website. They were each sentenced to 20-year terms of imprisonment in early 2017 after having pleaded guilty in December 2015 to charges of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"This case involves the members of an organized criminal group that operated websites dedicated to the advertisement and distribution of child sexual abuse material. The website had three administrators, including Steven Chase and Michael Fluckiger, and a number of moderators, including David Lynn Browning. The website, which was hosted by a server in North Carolina, could be accessed by members only and operated on the Tor anonymity network, using elaborate file encryption to prevent the detection by law enforcement authorities. In total, more than 150,000 members authored and accessed tens of thousands of postings related to the sexual abuse of children, sometimes as young as infants or toddlers.Browning and Fluckiger were heavily involved in the day-to-day operations, which encompassed managing membership, developing and enforcing strict rules and deleting content unrelated to child sexual abuse material. Browning joined the website on 13 November 2014. Until 4 March 2015, the Browning spent over 700 hours logged in to the website, authored more than 1,000 postings, and designed the logo of the website. In 2015, a criminal complaint was filed against Browning and Fluckiger, accusing them of conspiracy to advertise child pornography contrary to 18 U.S.C. § 2251(d)(1) and (e). Fluckiger pleaded guilty on 2 December 2015 and Browning on 18 December 2015; both were sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment followed by a lifetime term of supervised release.Steven Chase was convicted of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise and related charges on 16 September 2016.

"On January 5, 2012, a grand jury returned an indictment against many of the claimants in this action, charging them with criminal copyright infringement and money laundering ""with estimated harm to copyright holders well in excess of $500,000,000 and reported income in excess of $175,000,000."" The claimants' alleged copyright infringement scheme, dubbed the ""Mega Conspiracy,"" used public websites to facilitate the illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted movies, software, television programs, and music. The government estimates that the alleged criminal conduct has caused billions of dollars in harm to the copyright holders.Following the indictment, the district court issued restraining orders for assets in New Zealand and Hong Kong where most of the remaining identified proceeds resided. The High Court in Hong Kong responded almost immediately by issuing a restraining order against approximately $60 million in assets, while New Zealand first arrested several of the now-claimants, released them on bail, and then several months later, in April, registered restraining orders on $15 million in assets. New Zealand also scheduled extradition hearings for August 2012, but these hearings have been continued at least eight times at the claimants' request.The New Zealand restraining orders could only remain registered for two years, after which they could be extended for up to one year. Recognizing that the restraints would run out on April 18, 2014, or if extended on April 18, 2015, the United States filed this civil forfeiture action against forty-eight assets restrained pursuant to the criminal indictment in the district court on July 29, 2014. Although restraining orders froze the assets in the lead up to this action, the New Zealand courts have routinely released funds to claimants for living and legal expenses. Some of these have been very substantial, including millions in legal fees for Kim Dotcom, and $170,000 per month for living expenses for the same claimant.Most of the claimants in this case filed their claims together on August 28, and Mona Dotcom filed a spousal claim on September 1, 2014. The claimants also filed a joint waiver of notice. The government subsequently moved to strike all the claimants' claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2466, the federal fugitive disentitlement statute. On February 27, 2015, the district court granted the motion to strike, having allowed claimants to appear and present arguments on the motion but not on the merits of the case. The government then moved for default judgment, which the district court granted on March 25, 2015, issuing forfeiture orders for the assets in New Zealand and Hong Kong.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
"This case involves seven members of an organized criminal group that used the Domain Name System (DNS) Changer malware with co-conspirators to engage in a fraudulent advertisement scheme.The group posed as a legitimate Internet advertisement agency and entered into Internet advertising agreements where the defendants were paid to receive money each time a user clicked on a website link or advertisement. The defendants used rogue DNS servers and malware to fraudulently increase traffic, in turn increasing their revenue.  The malware would infect users’ systems, alter users’ DNS server settings to route activity to the rogue DNS servers, prevent anti-virus from receiving software updates, and facilitate click hijacking (i.e., where clicking on a search result redirects the user to the perpetrators’ desired site which the perpetrators receive payment for) and click fraud (i.e., fraudulently replacing advertisements on sites with desired advertisements that perpetrators receive payment for). To prevent detection from law enforcement and conceal the source of the proceeds of crime, one of the defendants was suspected of engaging in money-laundering activities by (attempting to) transport the proceeds out of the US.The defendants were charged in a 27-count-indictment in October 2011. Vladimir Tsastsin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit computer intrusion and was sentenced to 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment with one year of supervision after release and was required to forfeit USD 2.5 million. Other co-conspirators also pleaded guilty and were sentenced for their crimes, including Timur Gerassimenko and Valeri Aleksejev, 4 years’ imprisonment each; Dmitri Jegorov, 3 years and 8 months’ imprisonment; Konstantin Poltev, 3 years and 4 months’ imprisonment; and Anton Ivanov to time served.

"The defendant, Su Bin, a national of China, was the owner and operator of an aviation and aerospace technology business. Between 2008 and 2014, the defendant and his two co-conspirators conspired to gain unauthorized access to computers and computer networks of U.S. defense contractors to obtain sensitive data and military data (including aviation data), which was subject to export controls, and provide this data to others located outside of the U.S. for financial gain. Specifically, on multiple occasions, the defendant’s co-conspirators, who were in China, gained unauthorized access to systems, retrieved proprietary data, showed the defendant what was accessed, and received guidance from the defendant on what information to obtain from the systems. The defendant also translated the data from English to Chinese. The co-conspirators used various techniques to surreptitiously access systems and networks to evade detection. In 2015, the defendant unsuccessfully fought his extradition to the United States. After his extradition to the United States, in 2016, the defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976. That same year, he was sentenced to 46 months’ imprisonment for his crimes.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"In 2013, and international investigation led US prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to charge 7 individuals with money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The defendants ran Liberty Reserve, a digital payment facility, which allegedly laundered more than USD 6 billion in criminal proceeds. Liberty Reserve was shut down by US authorities in May 2013 as a result of the investigation. Liberty Reserve – incorporated in 2006 in Costa Rica – was a centralized digital currency service. It allowed users to deposit physical currency – Euros or US Dollars - by converting it into a digital currency pinned to the value of the physical one. Once deposited the money, users were allowed to transfer it to other users. The only personal information required to register was a name, e-mail address and birthdate. Liberty Reserve charged a small fee for each transaction.According to the investigators, Liberty Reserve was operated do facilitate money-laundering. Its structure and high degree of untraceability provided cybercriminals with a perfectly functioning tool to store and transfer the proceeds of their illegal activities. Before its shut down, the overall number of Liberty Reserve’ users worldwide exceeded on million and over 55 million transactions were conducted through its system. Such transactions included the transfer of proceeds of credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, narcotics trafficking.One of the co-founders of Liberty Reserve, Vladimir Kats, an American citizen, pleaded guilty before the Federal Court of the Southern District of New York on 31 October 2013 to conspiring to commit money laundering, conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, receiving child pornography and marriage fraud.The other co-founder, Arthur Budovsky, a citizen of Costa Rica, was arrested in Spain in May 2013 and extradited to the US in October 2014.The US Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations carried out the investigation.

"On 23 January 2013, the US District Court of the Southern District of New York unsealed three indictments against Nikita Vladimirovich Kuzmin, Deniss Calovskis and Mihai Ionut Paunescu. The defendants were charged with conspiracy in fraud and related activities in connection with computers and access devices for the creation and use of the Gozi virus. The Gozi virus is one of the most harmful computer viruses ever created. It infected at least one million computers worldwide and 40,000 in the US. It caused the theft or loss of tens of millions of dollars. The virus was undetectable by anti-virus software and was able to collect data from infected devices, including personal bank account information, usernames and passwords. The stolen information was then transmitted to servers controlled by the defendants. The defendants used such information to steal funds from victims’ bank accounts. Kuzmin created the Gozi virus in 2005. Calovskis developed a number of features, including an altered webpage of a bank that was used to steal personal information from the victims. Paunescu created a “bulletproof host”, i.e. a system preventing law enforcement authorities from detecting illegal activities. He leased servers from legitimate hosting providers and then sub-leased them to the cybercriminals. He also distributed malware, such as the “Zeus trojan” and the “SpyEye trojan”, and spam.Kuzmin was arrested in the US in November 2010 and pled guilty in May 2011. Calovskis was arrested in Latvia in November 2012. In August 2013, the Latvian government agreed to extradite Calovskis to the US. However, Calovskis appealed the decision to the Europen Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The ECHR ruled that the extradition is lawful. However, the ECHR ordered the Latvian government not to extradite Calovskis until its judgment became final.Calovskis was later extradited to the US, where he plead guilty to writing part of the virus, and was sentenced to 21 months of prison. Paunescu was arrested in Romania in December 2012 and his extradition proceeding is pending before Romanian authorities.",trafficking in persons,Sentenced
"Vadim Vassilenko, president of Western Express International, along with four defendants, allegedly formed and participated in a criminal enterprise. They were charged with crimes such as scheming to defraud, money laundering, grand larceny, and enterprise corruption. Western Express International operated legitimate services, such as cash checking and translation services; it also allegedly operated illegal activities such as acting as an intermediary for buying and selling stolen credit card data for a commission. Stolen credit card data was alledegly sold through Western Express International to people such as Latta, Perez, Roach, and Washington. The purpose of this sale was to use stolen credit card data to make fraudulent purchases on the internet. Additionally, Western Express provided vendors with credit by using digital currencies like Egold and Webmoney, which were unregulated. This allowed vendors to engage in transactions without disclosing their identities.  The appellants were charged with cybercrimes, such as scheming to defraud, money laundering, grand larceny, and enterprise corruption, although the present appeal dealt with the charge of enterprise corruption. They allegedly used the business entity Western Express International to avoid detection and to systematically traffic stolen credit card data and to engage in money laundering. Computers at Western Express International and Vassilenko’s residences included evidence of money orders, forged credit cards, and defendants’ email, which contained information such as illegally obtained credit card numbers. The prosecution sought to establish that a criminal enterprise existed in order to carry out these activities, which occurred alongside Western Express International’s legitimate business activities. Hackers obtained credit card information that was then used to make counterfeit credit cards or to purchase things online fraudulently.Vassilenko, president of Western Express International, allegedly sought to use the business as a business with legitimate activities in order to allow people to carry out their illegal activities without detection.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence

"The case involves illegal bulking email obscene advertising in the US. The defendants started their business in 2003. At the beginning, they operated through a US corporation. Later on, they decided to run their operations from a Mauritian company – using servers located in the Netherlands – in order to avoid compliance with the email communications bill passed in the US in 2003, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (hereinafter, the “CAN-SPAM Act”). The defendants sent email advertisements, including pornographic content. If the recipients clicked on the links contained in the email and subsequently paid a fee, the defendants earned a commission.The defendants used fictitious information in their bulk emails and registration of their domain names. They placed non-existing email addresses in the “From” field in the headers of their emails. They provided false information in the “Contact person” and “Phone number” fields of their domains’ registration.On 25 June 2007, the defendants were convicted on 8 counts from the District Court of Arizona for conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1037(a)(3) through fraud in connection with electronic mail (Count 1), violation of § 1037(a)(3) and (a)(4) through such fraud (Counts 2 and 3), interstate transportation of obscene materials in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1462 (Counts 4 and 5), interstate transportation of obscene materials for sale in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1465 (Counts 6 and 7); conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956 (Count 8), and failure to meet record keeping requirements in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2257 (Count 9).The first three counts regard the offence of “Fraud and related activity in connection with electronic mail” introduced by the CAN-SPAM Act. The defendants were convicted of materially falsifying  header information in multiple commercial electronic mail messages and intentionally initiating the transmission of such messages [§ 1037(a)(3)] and registering, using information that materially falsifies the identity of the actual registrant, for five or more electronic mail accounts or online user accounts or two or more domain names, and intentionally initiating the transmission of multiple commercial electronic mail messages from any combination of such accounts or domain names [§ 1037(a)(4)].The defendants appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals arguing that (i) the district court erred in instructing the jury as to the definition of obscene expression pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1462 and 1465; (ii) the offence of “Fraud and related activity in connection with electronic mail” (18 U.S.C. § 1037) was unconstitutional as it was overly vague; (iii) counts 1-3 were incorrectly labelled as felonies; (iv) the count of conspiracy money laundering is invalid if the preceding appeals are successful since an unlawful activity is a pre-requisite for the money laundering offence; (v) the application of a two-level obstruction of justice enhancement to one of the defendants’ sentence was error.The defendants’ claim that 18 U.S.C. § 1037 was unconstitutional is based on the vagueness doctrine, according to which  “Vague statutes are invalidated for three reasons”: (1) to avoid punishing people for behaviour that they could not have known was illegal; (2) to avoid subjective enforcement of laws based on `arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement' by government officers; and (3) to avoid any chilling effect on the exercise of First Amendment freedoms."" The defendants argued that the terms ""impair,"" ""altered,"" and ""concealed."" used to describe the material falsification were vague. The court rejected the argument.  The court affirmed the defendants’ convictions and sentences and recognized that there was a clerical error with regard to counts 1-3 (the CAN-SPAM Act offences) and remanded.",trafficking in persons,Not Sentence
